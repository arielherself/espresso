At the <strong>UN General Assembly</strong> 143 countries approved a resolution condemning <strong>Russia’s</strong> [illegal annexation](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/30/what-is-annexation) of four Ukrainian regions. Thirty-five countries abstained, including China and India, while five countries voted against the motion. Meanwhile Britain, Canada, France and the Netherlands promised to send more <strong>military aid</strong> to <strong>Ukraine</strong>, including [advanced air-defence systems](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/11/how-the-west-is-helping-ukraine-beat-russias-missiles), following a NATO meeting in Brussels. America had already made a similar pledge. Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, explicitly stated that his country would not respond with nuclear weapons if Russia deployed them in Ukraine.

Hours after the UN vote <strong>Russia</strong> shelled more than 40 Ukrainian cities and towns, including [strikes](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/10/russia-launches-a-wave-of-missiles-across-ukraine) near the capital, Kyiv, according to officials. Alexander Venediktov, the deputy secretary of Russia’s Security Council, warned of a “guaranteed escalation to a world war three” if the country was admitted to <strong>NATO. </strong>Two weeks ago Ukraine requested a fast-track membership into the Western alliance.

<strong>Saudi Arabia </strong>defended the <strong>OPEC+</strong> decision to [cut its oil-production target](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/10/05/opec-defies-joe-biden-with-a-big-output-cut). In a detailed statement, the kingdom’s foreign ministry said the cartel’s decision was made through consensus and based “purely on economic considerations”. America has said it would be reevaluating its relationship with Saudi Arabia.

<strong>Liz Truss</strong>, Britain’s prime minister, faced increasing pressure from her Conservative MPs to reverse some of the tax cuts outlined in her recent [“mini-budget”](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically). Kwasi Kwarteng, her chancellor, said that the <strong>Bank of England</strong> will be responsible for any [market volatility](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/10/12/britains-government-is-yet-to-deal-with-a-mess-of-its-own-making) after Friday, when its emergency bond-buying scheme, introduced to help pension funds after the budget, must end.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>TSMC</strong>, a giant <strong>chipmaker</strong>, reported better-than-expected results for the quarter ending in September amid a [slowdown](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/09/29/why-some-chipmakers-are-hurting-much-more-than-others) in the industry. Net profit surged to NT$280.9bn ($8.8bn), an 80% increase over the previous year. The Taiwanese firm said growth was boosted by strong sales of the high-tech chips used in [data centres](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/06/the-cloud-is-the-fiercest-front-in-the-chip-wars) and electric vehicles.

President <strong>Joe Biden</strong> named <strong>China</strong> as America’s “most consequential geopolitical challenge” in his first National Security Strategy. The document, a high-level plan for keeping America safe that is required of each new administration, was due last year but delayed as [Russia amassed troops on its border with Ukraine](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/11/how-the-west-is-helping-ukraine-beat-russias-missiles). Mr Biden also highlighted the importance of “restraining” Russia while strengthening America’s alliances and democratic institutions.

A jury in Connecticut ordered <strong>Alex Jones</strong>, a right-wing conspiracy theorist, to pay $965m in damages for claiming that the <strong>Sandy Hook school massacre</strong> was a [hoax](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/03/19/sandy-hook-was-a-turning-point-in-americas-battle-over-truth). Family members of eight victims and an FBI agent who responded to the shooting had sued Mr Jones for defamation. It was the second of three such trials—at an [earlier one](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/08/05/the-alex-jones-defamation-case-was-less-about-the-money-than-the-truth) Mr Jones was ordered to pay nearly $50m.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> £60bn ($67bn), the estimated amount Britain’s government needs to find in savings to fulfil its “mini-budget”. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/10/11/liz-truss-has-made-britain-a-riskier-bet-for-bond-investors).

## America remains in the grip of inflation

On the surface, it might seem like a relief. The latest data on headline inflation in America, due to be released on Thursday, are likely to be relatively placid for a third consecutive month. Prices are forecast to have risen about 0.2% in September compared with [August](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/09/13/america-still-has-an-inflation-problem). The problem is that, beneath the surface, inflationary momentum is still far too strong for comfort. Core inflation (stripping out volatile food and energy costs) may have risen by about 0.5% month-on-month.

With underlying inflation still running that high, investors are all but certain that the Federal Reserve will deliver yet another [jumbo rate increase](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/09/21/as-america-raises-rates-the-rest-of-the-world-bears-the-pain) next month and perhaps one more before the end of the year. The aggressive pace of tightening is [weighing heavily](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/29/markets-are-reeling-from-higher-rates-the-world-economy-is-next) on global stock and bond markets, leading some critics to call for the Fed to relent. But until inflation itself relents, it will stay on the warpath.

## Congress’s final January 6th hearing

The congressional committee investigating the [attack on the Capitol](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2021/01/06/trumps-supporters-storm-the-capitol-to-block-the-transfer-of-power) on January 6th 2021 will hold what is expected to be its final hearing on Thursday. This instalment will focus on summarising the case against Donald Trump for [failing to stop](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/06/29/donald-trumps-shameful-role-in-the-storming-of-the-capitol) those of his supporters who sacked the building in a bid to overturn his election loss. The committee plans to issue a final report before the [next Congress](https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/us-midterms-2022/forecast/senate) sits in January. If Republicans take control after November’s elections, they are likely to suspend the committee’s unfinished work and to counter-attack by blaming Democrats for intelligence and security failures on the day. 

Exactly how much criminality the current investigators have unearthed is unclear. The [Department of Justice](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/07/27/the-justice-department-is-moving-against-donald-trump), which makes independent decisions on criminal charges, has seized phones of some of the central actors identified by the committee. But the scope of its inquiry remains unclear. Mr Trump, who is no stranger to [legal jeopardy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/05/how-much-legal-jeopardy-is-donald-trump-in), appears largely unfazed.

## The Bank of England’s tough love

The disastrous consequences of the [British government’s](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/10/11/liz-truss-has-made-britain-a-riskier-bet-for-bond-investors) [mini-budget](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically) of September 23rd continue to reverberate through febrile markets. Days after the budget the Bank of England was forced to intervene with an emergency bond-buying scheme aimed at helping troubled pension funds and stopping a fire-sale of [gilts](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/10/12/britains-government-is-yet-to-deal-with-a-mess-of-its-own-making). On Wednesday the bank reiterated its commitment to ending the scheme by Friday—but only after mixed-messaging had sent the pound whipsawing.

But what happens after Friday? The worry is that after the withdrawal of the bank as the buyer of last resort, chaotic selling will resume. The bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, told the pension funds on Tuesday that they had to “sort out” their financial resilience before the deadline. Few in the market, however, seriously expect the bank to sit on its hands if widespread disorder returns. Underlying all the jitters is a basic scepticism about the government’s ability to fund its planned tax cuts, which Liz Truss, the prime minister, is under increasing pressure to reverse. Until that is dealt with, expect more jitters.

## A controversial new speaker for Italy’s Senate

On Thursday Italy’s new parliament meets for the first time since last month’s [general election](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/25/italy-chooses-a-party-with-a-neo-fascist-legacy). A coalition of right-wing parties emerged with solid majorities in both houses. Together the [Brothers of Italy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/22/giorgia-meloni-and-her-brothers-of-italy-look-set-to-win-the-next-election) (FdI), the Northern League and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party won 74 seats more than the opposition in the 400-member Chamber of Deputies, and 30 more in the 200-seat Senate. Giorgia Meloni of the hard-right FdI is almost certain to become prime minister before the end of the month. But the lawmakers’ first task will be to choose speakers for both houses.  
  
 Deciding who will preside over the Senate is particularly sensitive: the speaker would succeed Italy’s 81 year-old president, [Sergio Mattarella](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/01/30/the-re-election-of-sergio-mattarella-as-president-saves-italys-governing-coalition), were he to die or be incapacitated. A leading FdI lawmaker said the right had agreed on Ignazio La Russa, a gravelly-voiced ex-defence minister who has a collection of fascist memorabilia at home and joked during the pandemic that Italians should use the fascist salute to avoid shaking hands.

## A film festival about immigration

For nine years the Immigration Film Fest has shared the stories of immigrants—often produced by immigrants themselves. This year’s event, which begins on Thursday with screenings in Washington and online, will showcase nearly 40.  
 “Operation: Allies Welcome” follows Afghans fleeing the Taliban as they settle in northern Virginia. “Stop Time” chronicles how a [sanctuary church](https://te.arielherself.xyz/erasmus/2018/10/17/when-houses-of-prayer-become-places-of-shelter) housed Lucio Perez, an undocumented migrant, for three years in defiance of a deportation order. 

The theme of the festival, “home”, is the focus of “My DACA Life”, a documentary about Maribel, a young undocumented migrant who arrived in America as a child. She was granted leave to stay under Barack Obama’s DREAM Act. After she made her first trip back to Mexico, that right was overturned under [Donald Trump](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2017/09/09/donald-trump-ditches-daca). As American policymakers face increasing numbers of arrivals and continue to [struggle](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/10/04/the-biden-administration-is-quietly-completing-bits-of-donald-trumps-wall) to develop fair and politically acceptable immigration policies, stories such as Maribel’s need to be told.
