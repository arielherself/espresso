<strong>China </strong>reeled from a weekend of [angry demonstrations](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/11/27/unrest-breaks-out-across-china-as-frustration-at-lockdowns-grows), with tens of thousands of people protesting against the country’s draconian <strong>anti-covid measures</strong>. The rallies, unprecedented in their scale, took place in at least ten major cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, with some demonstrators holding aloft blank sheets of paper to decry the suppression of free speech. There were multiple clashes between protestors and security officers; two foreign journalists were caught up in the arrests. A relative calm seemed to emerge on Monday. Asian stockmarkets fell at the prospect of further unrest and President Xi Jinping’s anticipated response. Meanwhile, the number of new covid-19 infections reported hit a record 40,000.

<strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, Volodymyr Zelensky, warned Ukrainians to expect more Russian strikes as snow and freezing temperatures descended on Kyiv, the capital. Millions of people have only limited access to electricity, water and heat after Russian missiles pulverised much of Ukraine’s [energy infrastructure](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/23/in-ukraine-living-as-normal-is-an-act-of-defiance). Vitali Klitschko, Kyiv’s mayor, said that the blackouts could last until spring, with temporary evacuations possible. 

Talks between <strong>America </strong>and <strong>Russia </strong>on the “New START” treaty—meant to regulate their arsenals of <strong>strategic missiles</strong>—were postponed the day before they were due to start. America blamed Russia, accusing it of “unilaterally” calling off the summit scheduled to take place in Cairo, Egypt’s capital. The decision comes amid months of [nuclear threats](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/09/29/could-the-war-in-ukraine-go-nuclear) from President Vladimir Putin in response to Western support for Ukraine.

The attorney-general of the <strong>Bahamas</strong> said that <strong>FTX</strong>, the crypto-trading platform that filed for [bankruptcy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/11/17/the-failure-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried-will-leave-deep-scars) this month, remains the subject of “an active and ongoing investigation”. FTX was headquartered in the Caribbean country. Meanwhile, the chief executive of LMAX, another [crypto](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/17/is-this-the-end-of-crypto) trader, told a summit in London that the “contagion” from FTX’s demise would play out “in the next two weeks”.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Rio Tinto</strong> agreed to pay restitution for its destruction of ancient Aboriginal rock structures in Western Australia while building an iron ore mine in 2020. Two members of the mining company’s board resigned amid the scandal. The financial settlement was not disclosed at the request of the Puutu Kunti, Kirrama and Pinikura peoples, traditional owners of the Juukan Gorge site.

More than 80 people were injured during protests against a construction hailed as <strong>India’s</strong> first international deepwater port, in which fishermen clashed with police officers. The [Adani Group](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/05/19/gautam-adani-wants-to-cement-his-grip-on-indias-heavy-industry), which has been building the seaport since 2015, is the ultimate target of their ire. The fight has taken a sectarian hue, with Hindu groups rallying to Adani’s cause and Christian clergy charged as conspirators.

<strong>Football World Cup: </strong>Another remarkable game involving an [African team](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/24/how-do-budding-african-footballers-make-it-to-the-top) saw <strong>Cameroon</strong> fight back from two goals down to draw 3-3 with <strong>Serbia</strong>. The result follows <strong>Morocco’s </strong>shock win against <strong>Belgium</strong>, FIFA’s second-highest ranked team, only their third-ever victory in a World Cup. After the match Belgian police fired tear gas and arrested at least 10 people amid riots in Brussels, the capital. 

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 800%, the increase in Moderna’s share price since January 1st 2020. The vaccine-maker is the second-best-performing company in the S&amp;P 500. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/11/27/the-new-winners-and-losers-in-business).

## Fury mounts over lockdowns in China

Residents of China’s cities return to work on Monday after a weekend of widespread protests against draconian “[zero-covid](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/11/17/china-tweaks-its-zero-covid-policy)” measures. Frustrations with months of lockdowns spread after a fire in Urumqi, in the western region of Xinjiang, left ten dead on Thursday. Many blamed covid restrictions for hindering fire-fighters and occupants who were trying to escape. 

On Saturday night demonstrators in Shanghai called for President Xi Jinping to step down—an extremely rare show of defiance. On Sunday night in Beijing crowds sang the “Internationale”, a socialist anthem, and mourned the deaths in Xinjiang. Students at several university campuses held up blank sheets of paper to highlight China’s lack of free speech. 

China’s rulers hate instability. But they are in a bind. The country is gripped by its biggest covid outbreak yet. Elderly people are made more vulnerable by low vaccination rates. Many Chinese people are clearly furious with public-health rules. Reintroducing restrictions will probably spark more unrest.

## In with the old at Disney

Staff of the Magic Kingdom will gather on Monday morning for a virtual town-hall meeting with Bob Iger, who began a [second stint as chief executive](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/21/disney-brings-back-a-star-of-the-past-but-its-real-problem-is-the-script) a week ago. Mr Iger ran Disney for 15 stellar years before stepping down in 2020. His successor, Bob Chapek, had a tougher time and was booted out on November 20th after quarterly results showed growing losses at Disney+, the company’s streaming service. Mr Iger will now try to steady the ship in two years.

Investors are glad to have him back: Disney’s stock has risen since his return. And staff are mostly pleased that Mr Iger is undoing a centralising strategy initiated by Mr Chapek, handing power back to Disney’s creative teams. But the difficulties at Disney, and across Hollywood, run deeper. [Streaming](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/disney-netflix-apple-is-anyone-winning-the-streaming-wars/21807591) is undermining the cinema and cable industries and turning out to be less profitable than either. The [new-old Bob](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/11/23/what-disney-can-learn-from-elton-john) will need more than new-old ideas.

## Judicial nominees on the Senate’s agenda

On Monday America’s Senate returns from its Thanksgiving break to debate the [Respect for Marriage Act](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/16/us/politics/same-sex-marriage-bill-senate.html), a bill that would strengthen rights for same-sex couples. It will also consider some [two dozen nominees](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/executive_calendar/xcalv.pdf) for judgeships on federal courts and may hold votes on two district-court nominees.

Both are women: Camille Vélez-Rivé in Puerto Rico and Anne Nardacci in New York. That is consistent with President Joe Biden’s previous appointments: of the 85 judges he has seated so far, including Ketanji Brown Jackson on the Supreme Court, just 21 are men. Nearly a quarter are African-American and two-thirds are non-white.

The Democrats’ marginal majority in the Senate allowed Mr Biden to rapidly usher nominees into robes. If Raphael Warnock beats Herschel Walker (the Republican candidate) in a run-off election for Georgia’s seat on December 6th, Democrats will walk away from the midterms with 51 seats to the Republicans’ 49 (meaning Kamala Harris, the vice-president, will no longer be needed to break ties). This could speed things up further—and embolden Mr Biden to put forward more progressive nominees.

## The “real election” gets going in Chicago

Monday is the last day when candidates can file to run for mayor of Chicago—dubbed the “real election” by locals after the midterms. [Lori Lightfoot](https://te.arielherself.xyz/democracy-in-america/2019/04/03/lori-lightfoot-becomes-chicagos-first-black-female-mayor), the incumbent, is expected to wait until the last moment to do so. To participate, hopefuls must present at least 12,500 signatures from registered voters. The most successful traditionally manage many times that. In the sixties Richard J Daley, perhaps the most powerful American mayor, filed 500,000.

Ms Lightfoot, who sees herself as a successor to Harold Washington, the city’s first black mayor, once said she had “the biggest dick in Chicago”. But she faces a tough re-election campaign, having come under fire for her policies on crime and policing, and her supposed neglect of the downtown. She will also be competing with at least six other candidates, including Jesús “Chuy” Garcia, a combative Mexican-American congressman. Chicago was once famous for “machine politics”, but established politicians can no longer mechanically turn out blocks of votes like before. This election is anyone’s game. 

## AI outplays humans, again

Artificial intelligence has already trounced humans at backgammon, chess and Go. Now it can routinely win at Diplomacy, which for some aficionados is a truer marker of game-playing ability. Diplomacy, which sees players scrap for control of a pre-first world war Europe, is a very human pastime. Play demands collaboration but also allows for double-crossing.

In a paper recently published in <em>Science</em>, researchers at Meta—Facebook’s parent company—explain how they created Cicero, a program that could play Diplomacy, and win. (It ranked in the top 10% of players in an online multi-game tournament.) Like all AI game-playing projects, Cicero learnt through reinforcement: making more selective moves as it was rewarded for positive outcomes.

But Diplomacy also requires players to communicate with others well enough to implement their chosen strategy, whether treacherous or truthful. Thus Cicero also had to be trained to speak like a human player, using vast sets of language data. That it did so successfully proves an ability to negotiate, convince, co-operate and compete.
