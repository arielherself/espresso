President Joe Biden said <strong>Hurricane Ian</strong> may have caused a “substantial loss of life”, possibly making it the “[deadliest hurricane](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/29/hurricane-ian-pummels-florida) in Florida’s history”. The president declared it a major disaster, unleashing federal aid for several counties. Ian left more than 2m people in Florida without power. The hurricane is expected to hit South Carolina on Friday.

<strong>America</strong> will “never, never, never recognise Russia’s claims on Ukraine sovereign territory”, according to Mr Biden. His comments came before Russia’s formal announcement, expected on Friday, of its annexation of four Ukrainian regions where it held [sham referendums](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/29/ignore-putins-fake-referendums-and-keep-helping-ukraine) in the past week. Meanwhile Ukrainian officials said that 23 civilians were killed by a <strong>Russian missile attack</strong> in Zaporizhia, a Ukrainian-held city within one of these regions.

<strong>Liz Truss</strong>, Britain’s new prime minister, met with the government’s independent economic advisers on Friday, as she struggles to contain the [fallout](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/28/how-not-to-run-a-country) from last week’s [disastrous mini-budget](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically). A <em>Times </em>newspaper poll put her Conservatives 33 points behind Labour following the unveiling of huge unfunded tax cuts that caused the pound to crash, the Bank of England to intervene over rising gilt yields and the IMF to criticise the plan.

A <strong>suicide bombing</strong> at a private college in Afghanistan’s capital, <strong>Kabul</strong>, killed at least 19 people and wounded 27 others, according to police. The victims were students taking a mock university exam; most were women. While there was [a lull in such attacks](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/11/afghanistan-is-poorer-and-hungrier-than-a-year-ago) after the Taliban’s takeover of the country in August 2021, their frequency has recently increased. Many are claimed by Islamic State, a militant group.

Factory activity in <strong>China</strong> unexpectedly grew in September, helped by covid measures easing in parts of the country. [Activity](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/09/20/chinas-rulers-seem-resigned-to-a-slowing-economy) in the services sector contracted sharply, however. Meanwhile the <strong>Reserve Bank of India</strong> raised interest rates as inflation remains above the central bank’s target range. It is the fourth consecutive increase since central bankers began tightening monetary policy in May. 

<strong>America </strong>struck a trade and security agreement with 14 <strong>Pacific-island</strong> countries. The deal includes $810m in financial assistance and measures to tackle climate change. It comes amid American concerns over China’s [growing influence in the region](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/06/02/chinas-interest-in-the-pacific-islands-is-growing). Mr Biden said the security of America and the world depends on “the security of the Pacific Islands”.

The death toll from protests in <strong>Iran </strong>rose to 83, according to a human-rights group. Demonstrations continue to take place in several cities over the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody, after she was [arrested for wearing a too-loose hijab](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/26/who-are-irans-hated-morality-police). Dozens of protesters, including journalists, are said to have been arrested. On Thursday Germany’s foreign minister called for the EU to impose sanctions against Iran.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>$50,000, the highest daily fee charged by Vishal Punjabi, a video-producer for Indian weddings, a booming business. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/09/29/matrimony-is-one-of-indias-biggest-businesses).

## Russia sets the stage for annexation

Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, is preparing to annex swathes of Ukrainian territory. In farcical referendums overseen by soldiers, residents in occupied parts of Kherson, Zaporizhia, Donetsk and Luhansk provinces supposedly “voted overwhelmingly” to join Russia. On Friday Mr Putin is expected to hold a ceremony in the Kremlin during which he may lay claim to all four provinces, despite not controlling any in its entirety. 

The [sham referendums](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/23/voting-begins-in-four-sham-referendums-in-ukraine) were hastily announced in mid-September after Russia’s battlefield losses. Alongside [partial mobilisation](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/21/vladimir-putin-declares-a-partial-mobilisation) and a new [nuclear threat](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/14/do-russias-military-setbacks-increase-the-risk-of-nuclear-conflict), they dramatically increase the risks of uncontrolled escalation. The West is scrambling to respond. More sanctions may be announced. Diplomats are pushing India, and even China, to isolate the Kremlin. A test will be how they vote on an American-sponsored UN Security Council resolution denouncing the annexation on Friday.

Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said he will not change his approach to the war. Russia’s land-grab would, however, slam the door on any future negotiations.

## The wrath of Ian

South Carolinians will wake up on Friday after an uneasy night’s sleep. Hurricane Ian is forecast to [hit the state](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/29/hurricane-ian-pummels-florida) later in the day, having moved out into the Atlantic from the east coast of Florida on Thursday. “Life-threatening” floods, storm surges and winds are expected.

Those Ian left behind must start to grapple with its destruction. By the time it slammed into Florida on Wednesday, with winds approaching 150mph (240kph), it was one of the most powerful storms ever to make landfall in the contiguous United States. It had already knocked out Cuba’s electricity grid. In Florida homes and roads were submerged and destroyed; millions lost access to power and drinking water. Ron DeSantis, the state’s governor, said that he was expecting casualties, though the death toll is not yet clear. Ian is also expected to be among the costliest hurricanes on record. But that record is accelerating too, as [climate change](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/29/is-climate-change-making-hurricanes-worse) makes hurricanes stronger, wetter and slower—and thus more damaging.

## Europe’s big decisions on energy

The agenda for the meeting of Europe’s energy ministers on Friday was already looking bulky. Then someone blew up [Nord Stream 1 and 2](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/02/22/the-west-imposes-swift-sanctions-on-russia-can-they-stop-a-war), the gas pipelines connecting Russia and Germany. The European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, has promised the “strongest possible response”. The possible act of sabotage has brought into sharp relief the vulnerability of Europe’s energy supply.

Getting off to a quick start, ministers approved emergency windfall taxes on energy companies to help tackle [rising gas and electricity bills](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/09/27/the-wrong-way-to-solve-europes-energy-crisis). They also agreed to a 5% mandatory cut in electricity use during peak hours. For the remainder of the day they will hammer away at the more divisive idea of a cap on gas prices: either across the board or limited to Russian imports. But the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines—a reminder of Russia’s willingness to wage crippling energy warfare on Europe—make Russian gas flows ever less likely to resume.

## What do Texans care about most?

Texas’s Republican governor, [Greg Abbott](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/15/a-grassroots-group-is-channelling-public-frustration-in-texas), will face his Democratic rival, Beto O’Rourke, on Friday night. The debate in Edinburg, a border town in the south of Texas, is the only one in the Lone Star State before elections in November. The location, selected by Mr Abbott’s team, will allow him to highlight border security and [illegal immigration](https://te.arielherself.xyz/special-report/2019/06/20/immigration-shapes-the-politics-of-california-and-texas), which he has made central to his campaign.

Mr O’Rourke is trying to harness voters’ anger over Texas’s rightward shift on abortion and guns. Mr Abbott is betting that voters will care more about inflation and illegal immigration. He may be right: recent polls show him leading Mr O’Rourke by seven to eight points. The perception that the White House is not doing enough to [crack down on illegal immigration](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/05/22/the-title-42-furore-highlights-americas-broken-immigration-system) has pushed more Hispanic voters into the arms of the Republicans. Democratic hopes of demographic change turning Texas blue for now appear miscalculated.

## A portrait of environmental destruction

Over the past 20 years the Brazilian Amazon has lost 350,000 square kilometres to deforestation. This tragedy is the subject of “Broken Spectre”, a piece of video art by Richard Mosse, an Irish photographer. It opens at the National Gallery of Victoria in Australia on Friday, and at 180 The Strand, an exhibition space in London, on October 12th.

Through a combination of multi-spectral video, ultra-violet timelapses of the forest at night and black-and-white film, Mr Mosse reveals the war that ranchers, farmers, loggers and [<em>garimpeiros</em>](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/06/23/brazils-amazon-rainforest-has-become-more-dangerous) (wildcat miners) are waging on the rainforest. Over 74 minutes—the result of five years of work—the film shows trees felled and jungles set ablaze. The film’s visual effect is both dystopian and dreamlike; the scenes of destruction are also hauntingly beautiful. The intention is to “make people look again”, the artist explains. His work comes at a critical moment: in the run-up to the first round of Brazil’s [general election](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/09/08/jair-bolsonaro-is-poised-to-lose-the-brazilian-election) on Sunday, more fires, all man-made, were recorded in September than in any month in the past 12 years.
