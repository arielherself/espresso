## <p align="center">Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter</p>

<strong>Ukraine’s</strong> [Zaporizhia](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/08/19/what-is-at-stake-at-ukraines-zaporizhia-nuclear-plant) power plant was hit by shelling on Saturday and Sunday, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which warned that such attacks risked causing a [nuclear disaster](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/20/an-alarming-tug-o-war-over-a-ukrainian-nuclear-plant). Russia and Ukraine blamed each other for the attack on the facility, which is in Russian-controlled territory. Rafael Grossi, the head of the IAEA, warned “whoever is behind this” that “you’re playing with fire”.

<strong>COP27 </strong>in Egypt finally concluded on Sunday morning, 36 hours late, with delegates agreeing to establish a “[loss and damage](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/03/what-is-climate-loss-and-damage)” fund to help those most affected by rising temperatures—something many thought impossible two weeks ago. That seemed to be broadly welcomed by environmental groups. They were less enthused by timid measures to reduce the use of fossil fuels.

<strong>China’s</strong> defence ministry said it was willing to meet with <strong>America</strong> at a regional security summit in Cambodia this week. Talks between Lloyd Austin, America’s defence secretary and Wei Fenghe, his Chinese counterpart, would be the first military ones at a high level since China halted such communications after [the visit](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/03/nancy-pelosi-has-left-taiwan-the-real-crisis-may-be-just-beginning) of Nancy Pelosi, America’s House Speaker, to Taiwan in August.

A 22-year-old was named as a suspect in the <strong>Colorado shooting</strong> that killed at least five people and injured dozens more. Anderson Lee Aldrich is accused of opening fire at a gay nightclub before being stopped by local patrons. Joe Biden, America’s president, said that inequities that “contribute to violence against LGBTQI+ people” must be driven out.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Beijing</strong> told the 3.5m residents of its most populous district to stay at home from Monday, in a bid to contain rising covid-19 infections. China’s capital reported 516 new infections as of 3pm on Sunday, as well as the death of an 87-year-old man, China’s first known covid fatality since May 26th. The government recently announced a [slight easing](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/14/a-radical-shift-in-chinas-property-and-pandemic-policies) of its most draconian covid-control policies.

<strong>Donald Trump’s </strong>Twitter account was reactivated after <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, Twitter’s [new boss](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/10/31/how-will-elon-musk-shape-twitter), ran a poll on the social-media platform asking users whether the former president should be allowed back. They narrowly voted “yes”. Mr Trump, who was banned in the wake of the Capitol riot in 2021, snubbed the gesture. He had said that he will remain on Truth Social, his own platform.

<strong>Qatar </strong>had a disappointing start to the <strong>World Cup</strong>. The hosts lost 2-0 to Ecuador in the opening night of the tournament. It is the first time a [host country](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/17/in-defence-of-qatars-hosting-of-the-world-cup) has lost an opening match in the [history of the World Cup](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/11/18/is-the-world-cup-a-giant-waste-of-moneyhttps:/te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/11/17/the-qatar-world-cup-shows-how-football-is-changing). The upset was witnessed by Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Qatar’s emir, other royals and a crowd of 60,000 people.

<strong>Word of the week: </strong><em>kafala</em>, an Arabic word roughly meaning “sponsorship”. Workers under Qatar’s <em>kafala </em>system often have their freedom curtailed.

## What next for Ukraine?

One week on from Ukraine’s liberation of Kherson city, the frontlines of the war are stabilising again. Russia has been building new defensive positions on the left bank of the Dnieper river and moving thousands of troops from Kherson province to shore up its lines elsewhere. Western officials are unsure whether Ukraine has enough left in the tank for another big offensive before the end of the year. If so, it might come in Luhansk, a region in the east where Russia is under sustained pressure around the city of Svatove, or even in Zaporizhia, towards the “land bridge” to Crimea.

Meanwhile Russia, retreating on the ground, is intensifying its war in the air. On Thursday it conducted five air strikes and launched 25 cruise missiles across Ukraine. The campaign is designed to destroy the country’s energy infrastructure and leave Ukrainians [shivering over winter](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/01/keeping-ukraine-from-freezing-this-winter). In Kyiv, temperatures have dropped below freezing and the first snow of the season has arrived.

## A “new Kazakhstan”, but politics as usual

Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Kazakhstan’s president, won more than 80% of the vote in [Sunday’s snap election](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/11/17/old-politics-in-the-new-kazakhstan), according to an exit poll. Mr Tokayev called the vote 18 months early to deliver a “radical reset” of the political system, following protests in January that left 238 people dead and threatened his grip on power.

Nursultan Nazarbayev, Mr Tokayev’s predecessor, stamped out political opposition in the Central Asian country. He was routinely re-elected with vote shares of nearly 100%. He stepped down in 2019 with the intention of micromanaging his successor. But Mr Tokayev has distanced himself from the former strongman. Many suspect that Mr Nazarbayev’s cronies stoked the violence in January.

Mr Tokayev now promises to foster multiparty democracy. He says he is building a “new Kazakhstan” but seems to be using Mr Nazarbayev’s playbook. The “opposition” in Sunday’s election consists of five political nobodies who have done nothing to hold Mr Tokayev to account. His re-election is certain. It is very much old-style politics in Mr Tokayev’s new Kazakhstan.

## The World Cup kicks off

Rarely has a global sporting event created as much apprehension as the football World Cup in Qatar. The party, which starts on Sunday when Qatar takes on Ecuador, does not feel festive yet. On Friday officials banned the sale of alcohol in stadiums. Accommodation is still being completed. Fans have arrived, but no one is sure if they are real or paid by the organisers. The timing of the tournament, in the middle of a gruelling European football season, means teams have had little time to prepare.

The stadiums, however, are ready. Built at enormous cost and on the backs of migrant labourers, they will look superb on camera. And though they may be exhausted, the players will be up for it. The World Cup remains the sport’s biggest prize. And when the stars light up the pitch, even the most cynical fans may [forget their misgivings](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/17/in-defence-of-qatars-hosting-of-the-world-cup), which range from concerns over FIFA’s corruption to Qatar’s poor human-rights record.

## Mind (control) where you’re going

For many people, the merging of the human mind and robotic intelligence is more than a pipe dream or science fiction. Those with [spinal-cord injury](https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/spinal-implants-allow-paralysed-people-to-walk-swim-and-cycle-again/21807596), for instance, can use technology that connects nerves beneath damaged tissue to the brain, allowing the paralysed to walk again. Now, as reported in the journal <em>iScience</em>, three tetraplegics—people paralysed from the neck down—have learned to use mind-controlled wheelchairs. Special skullcaps sensed their brain waves, which were translated into directions for an intelligent-powered wheelchair.

The commands were simple: concentrate on moving both hands to turn left, and both feet to turn right. As the participants practised, the algorithm improved at interpreting their personal brain patterns. The humans’ brains changed too: their neural connectivity evolved as mind control came more naturally. After several months of training, two of the three tetraplegics could navigate a cluttered room using thought alone.

## Weekend profile: Changpeng Zhao, boss of Binance

The implosion of [FTX](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/09/the-spectacular-fall-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried), until recently a major crypto exchange, has left plenty of people with egg on their faces. But one crypto giant has emerged stronger—at least for now. Binance has cemented its status as the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. And [Changpeng Zhao](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/11/16/who-is-changpeng-zhao-the-chief-executive-of-binance), its 45-year-old co-founder and boss, has triumphed. The crypto crash may have taken its toll on Mr Zhao’s fortune, but he is still worth a cool $17bn. 

Mr Zhao was born in China in 1977. When he was 12 his family, facing repression at home, fled to Canada. But after studying computer science at McGill University in Montreal, Mr Zhao returned to China. In 2015, convinced that bitcoin “would do to finance what the internet would do to information,” he launched Bijie Tech, which offered software to crypto exchanges, in Shanghai. 

China soon shut down all crypto exchanges, but Mr Zhao was undeterred, skirting Chinese restrictions by relocating to various hubs around Asia. In July 2017 he launched his own cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. Today dozens of billions of dollars worth of assets change hands each day on the platform; Binance usually takes a 0.1% fee for its trouble. 

The company has thrived thanks to Mr Zhao’s ruthless decision-making. At the height of the boom in ICOs (initial coin offerings) in 2017, Binance rushed to list the flurry of newly launched cryptocurrencies, as other exchanges dawdled. Earlier this month, after rumours of trouble emerged at FTX, Mr Zhao said that Binance would sell $600m-worth of an FTX token—a move that precipitated his rival’s cash crunch. 

A complete crash across the sector would probably obliterate Mr Zhao’s wealth, most of which [is held](https://te.arielherself.xyz/christmas-specials/2021/12/18/the-most-powerful-people-in-crypto) in digital assets. And Binance faces other problems. Critics say Mr Zhao’s taste for “controlled chaos”, his reliance on a small inner circle and his ravenous appetite for growth have led to corner-cutting. The exchange’s history is peppered with damaging hacks and allegations of money-laundering. This week Mr Zhao promised more transparency and said Binance would prove that it has enough liquid assets to face any crisis. Yet as the crypto crash deepens and regulators come sniffing, the digital Teflon Man may not prove resistant to corrosion forever.
