<strong>China</strong> began its biggest-ever live fire military drills in the airspace and waters surrounding <strong>Taiwan</strong>, a day after the [visit by Nancy Pelosi](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/03/nancy-pelosi-has-left-taiwan-the-real-crisis-may-be-just-beginning), the speaker of America’s House of Representatives. Taiwan said the drills violate UN rules and called it “irresponsible, illegitimate behaviour”. Earlier several Taiwanese government websites were attacked by hackers. China claims the self-governing island as its own.

America’s Senate and Italy’s parliament approved the accession of <strong>Finland</strong> and <strong>Sweden</strong> to NATO. Both countries applied for membership to the alliance following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Full membership requires approval from all 30 of NATO’s members. Seven, [including sceptical Turkey](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/06/16/is-turkey-more-trouble-to-nato-than-it-is-worth), have yet to ratify the move.

The <strong>Bank of England</strong> [raised interest rates](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/08/04/how-will-the-bank-of-englands-rate-rises-hit-borrowers) by 0.5 percentage points to 1.75% in response to rising inflation, echoing the [aggressive action](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/07/27/the-fed-is-no-longer-taking-baby-steps-to-rein-in-inflation) taken by the European Central Bank and America&#x27;s Federal Reserve. The bank said it now expected inflation to pass 13% in 2022, well above its forecast in May, and to remain at “very elevated levels” in 2023.

<strong>Glencore</strong>, a minerals-and-metals giant, announced profits for the first half of 2022 more than doubling to a record $18.9bn. The miner has cashed in on its bid to [stick with its coal business](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/01/01/glencores-message-to-the-planet)—which others have retreated from in recent years—as the fossil fuel’s price has surged following the war in Ukraine.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Ukraine</strong> warned that Russia had started a <strong>new offensive</strong> aimed at the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, which lies about 50km from the southern frontline and is the hometown of the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Earlier Mr Zelensky urged <strong>Xi Jinping</strong>, his Chinese counterpart, to hold direct talks with him. China has [refused to condemn](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/03/19/the-war-in-ukraine-will-determine-how-china-sees-the-world) Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and ignored requests to engage with the Ukrainian government’s top brass.

<strong>SoftBank</strong>, a Japanese investment group, raised as much as $22bn this year by selling a third of its shares in <strong>Alibaba</strong>, a Chinese e-commerce giant, on deferred contracts. According to the <em>Financial Times</em> it has now reduced its stake in Alibaba overall by more than half, although it retains the option to buy the shares back. SoftBank has been scrambling for cash recently as [tech stocks have slumped](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/05/16/after-a-bruising-year-softbank-braces-for-more-pain). 

Parts of the<strong> Great Barrier Reef</strong> in Australia have the highest level of <strong>coral cover</strong> in 36 years, according to a long-term monitoring programme. In about two-thirds of the reef, coral cover exceeded more than 30%, the level considered healthy. But scientists warned that the reef remains vulnerable to both man-made threats, such as bleaching, and natural ones, like infestations of crown-of-thorns starfish.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>62,000, the number of Cubans estimated to have died as a result of the covid-19 pandemic, seven times more than the official toll.

## Russia’s faltering invasion

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine seems to be running out of steam. Richard Moore, the chief of MI6, Britain’s overseas-intelligence service, said as much last week. Russian attacks in Donetsk, in Ukraine’s east, have been half-hearted. A belt of Ukrainian defences shielding the cities of Slovyansk and Kramatorsk is holding firm.

Instead, much of the action is now in the south of the country, where Ukraine is ramping up counter-attacks towards the city of [Kherson](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/28/ukraine-is-gathering-strength-for-an-assault-on-kherson). Artillery duels are intense and Russia is conducting more air strikes. Ukraine hopes to leverage its advantage in longer-range weapons: on Monday it received four more American HIMARS and three similar European rocket-launchers. Yet pushing Russia out of Kherson province will be hard. Russia is reported to have moved ten of its scarce battalion-sized tactical groups to reinforce the area, virtually doubling its presence. As the war has shown, the defence tends to have the upper hand—whether it is Russian or Ukrainian.

## Lufthansa’s unsteady take-off

Lufthansa demonstrated an impressive rebound for full-service airlines in Europe when it reported results for the second quarter on Thursday. Travellers are returning to the air with a vengeance after pandemic lockdowns. The airline posted a profit before interest and taxes of €393m ($399m), with revenues of €8.5bn, compared with a loss in the same period last year of €827m. There are bright lights elsewhere, too. IAG, owner of British Airways, recently announced its first quarterly profit since the start of the pandemic, as did Air France-KLM. 

Yet amid the surge in demand for summer travel, [staff shortages](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/07/travel-chaos-in-europe-is-a-glimpse-of-a-future-with-few-spare-workers) have caused travel chaos and forced airports to ask carriers to cut schedules. Soaring inflation has led to higher wage demands and threats to [walk out](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/06/16/the-union-planning-britains-biggest-rail-strikes-for-three-decades). Lufthansa’s ground staff have already gone on strike, and this week its pilots overwhelmingly voted for industrial action. Add a looming recession and the resurgence in travel might yet be grounded. 

## Conservatives flood into Dallas for CPAC

On Thursday thousands of people will head to Dallas, Texas, for the Conservative Political Action Conference. Claiming to be the “most influential gathering of conservatives in the world”, CPAC offers the stage to the American and international right: including Viktor Orban, the populist prime minister of Hungary, who will speak on Thursday.

There are two things to watch. First is the role of Donald Trump. In his speech the former president may offer clues about whether he intends to run again in 2024. Most other speakers at CPAC are Trump loyalists. 

Then there are the policies. With [<em>Roe v Wade </em>overturned](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/06/24/the-supreme-courts-rejection-of-roe-will-hurt-the-poorest-most) many conservatives feel the wind is at their back to promote other goals, such as giving parents more rights over curriculums. Conservatives may have suffered a setback in [Kansas](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/08/03/kansans-vote-to-keep-the-right-to-abortion), yet that will only fire up the governors of Texas, Mississippi and Oklahoma, who will address the conference. As will pretty much everyone with dreams of rising on the right. 

## Britain pulls the monetary lever

On Thursday the Bank of England [raised interest rates by 0.5 percentage points](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/08/04/how-will-the-bank-of-englands-rate-rises-hit-borrowers), the biggest single increase in 27 years. Only one of the monetary policy committee’s nine members voted for a smaller increase. Although Britain’s annual inflation rate of 9.4% in June was mostly the result of external shocks (principally high global energy prices), the aggressive rate rise is supposed to show that the bank is serious about quashing home-grown inflationary pressure, particularly stemming from a[ tight labour market](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/06/22/britains-government-is-restraining-public-sector-pay-to-curb-inflation).

But the action also comes amid a [grim outlook for the economy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/07/28/the-bank-of-england-must-weather-high-inflation-and-meddling-politicians). Energy bills could rise by an eye-popping 75% this autumn, draining wallets and dampening activity. The bank’s agents have already seen signs of softening demand as incomes are squeezed, and there are early signals of the housing market slowing. Policymakers expect the economy to sink into recession in the fourth quarter of the year, and for consumption to drop.

## A homecoming for the Elgin marbles?

Greece and Britain have each laid claims to the Parthenon, or Elgin, marbles for over 200 years. The Greeks say the sculptures were looted from the Parthenon, the ancient temple on the Acropolis in Athens. Britain says Greece’s erstwhile Ottoman overlords approved the removal of the frieze. As other European museums have started [returning colonial-era treasures](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/western-museums-are-starting-to-return-colonial-era-treasures), the British Museum has stood out in its refusal—until now. This week it proposed a “Parthenon partnership” to loan the sculptures to Greece.

Greece has not yet responded to the suggestion, perhaps because it could imply a tacit acceptance of British ownership. But in January it adopted a similar arrangement to display a Parthenon fragment from a Sicilian museum, a loan that paved the way for a permanent handover. A YouGov poll in November found that 59% of Britons favour the return of the marbles to Greece. Alternative solutions include dividing the sculptures, or, more fancifully, using robots to carve replicas for Britain to keep. Whatever the final deal, a homecoming for the marbles looks closer than ever.
