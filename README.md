## <p align="center">Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter</p>

<p align="center">Origin: <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-world-in-brief">https://www.economist.com/the-world-in-brief</a><hr>

 **Wildfires** continue to ravage southern France, Portugal, Spain and north Africa, as well as parts of Croatia, Greece, Italy and Turkey. Temperatures have soared above 45℃ in several places, intensifying [fears about climate change](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/04/16/in-chilly-parts-of-europe-heatwaves-strengthen-environmentalism). Thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes in the French department of Gironde, in Spain’s province of Malaga and in parts of Morocco. No respite is expected over the next few days. Britain has issued its first-ever “extreme heat” warning.

A spokesman for **Ukraine’s** military-intelligence agency has said **Russia** is preparing for the next stage of its offensive in the country. He said that, besides missile attacks from land and sea, shelling has continued along the entire front line. On Saturday Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, ordered units to ramp up attacks in order to pre-empt Ukrainian [strikes on occupied areas](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/06/30/does-a-protracted-conflict-favour-russia-or-ukraine).

 **America’s** president, Joe Biden, returned from the **Middle East** after a summit with the leaders of nine Arab countries in Jeddah, without securing public commitments either on increased oil production, or new regional security arrangements to counter Iran that would include Israel. But he said America [not cede the Middle East](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/07/12/what-does-the-middle-east-offer-america) to China or Russia:“The United States is not going anywhere.”

 **Iran** has imposed sanctions on 61 Americans, accusing them of backing an exiled dissident group. The blacklist includes officials who served under President Donald Trump, including Rudy Giuliani, his lawyer, Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and John Bolton, the White House national security adviser. The sanctions are largely symbolic but come as America’s efforts [to revive the 2015 nuclear pact](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/nuclear-talks-with-iran-enter-the-endgame/21807592) are faltering.

 .

Mexico said it had arrested **Rafael Caro Quintero** , a founding member of the powerful Guadalajara Cartel, during a military operation in the north-western state of Sinaloa. The drugs lord is on [America’s most-wanted list](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2013/08/17/ghosts-of-the-past) for the kidnapping and murder of an American anti-narcotics agent in 1985. Officials said they would seek the fugitive’s immediate extradition.

Infuriating protesters, Ranil Wickremesinghe, **Sri Lanka** ’s acting president, was nominated by its ruling party for the permanent job. He would replace Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who last week [fled to Singapore](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/13/sri-lankas-president-flees-leaving-the-country-in-chaos) after mass protests and resigned. Mr Wickremesinghe is likely to face several challengers when nominations are submitted on Tuesday. But the ruling party still has a parliamentary majority. 

European leaders have congratulated **North Macedonia** after its parliament voted to approve proposals that will allow it to open negotiations on accession to the European Union. North Macedonia was one of [six countries in the western Balkans](https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/08/12/six-balkan-nations-keep-trying-to-join-the-european-union) that have been candidates for EU membership for nearly two decades. Talks have been blocked by a long-running dispute with **Bulgaria** over history and language.

 **Word of the Week:** <em>post-quantum cryptography</em>, new encryption mathematics that outpaces the capabilities even of quantum computers. [Read the full article](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/14/what-to-do-now-about-tomorrows-code-cracking-computers).

## Sunday night Tory-vision

The five [contenders](https://www.economist.com/interactive/2022/07/12/the-race-to-become-britains-next-pm) vying to [succeed Boris Johnson](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/07/12/the-conservative-party-after-boris-johnson) as leader of Britain’s Conservative Party—and hence prime minister—will face each other in a televised debate on Sunday evening. They are [Liz Truss](https://www.economist.com/britain/2021/04/08/liz-truss-and-the-power-of-perkiness), the foreign secretary; [Rishi Sunak](https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/11/26/rishi-sunak-thatcherite-at-heart), a former chancellor; [Tom Tugendhat](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2022/07/13/tom-tugendhat-on-his-ten-year-plan-for-britains-growth), chairman of the foreign-affairs committee; [Penny Mordaunt](https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/05/09/penny-mordaunt-is-on-manoeuvres), a trade minister; and [Kemi Badenoch](https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/10/03/the-tories-launch-a-culture-war), a former local-government minister. The first debate was held on Friday, and the last one will take place on Tuesday.  
  
 The candidates should expect to be grilled again on tax, tackling inflation, the war in Ukraine, transgender rights and how to restore trust to British politics after Mr Johnson’s scandal-hit tenure. Although all Britons can tune in to the debate, [few have a vote](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/07/14/britains-prime-minister-becomes-a-rotten-presidency). That right belongs only to Conservative MPs, who this week will whittle down the candidates to a final two, and then around 180,000 members of the party who will be balloted to choose the winner over the summer.

## An ugly fight for Wisconsin

For the Democratic Party to improve its [hold on America’s Senate](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/05/18/republicans-divide-and-democrats-unite-in-the-pennsylvania-primaries) in November it needs to win Wisconsin. On Sunday Democrats vying for the party’s nomination will hold a debate, ahead of the primary election in August.

In Wisconsin, which narrowly voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and then for Joe Biden in 2020, a good Democratic candidate should have a chance. But the fight for the nomination has turned ugly. [Mandela Barnes](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/11/07/milwaukees-north-side-remains-deeply-troubled) (pictured), the state’s 35-year-old lieutenant-governor, has led the polls for months. But Alex Lasry, the 34-year-old son of a billionaire hedge-funder, has spent $6m of his own money catching up. Mr Barnes is a progressive who rails against “millionaire” politicians; Mr Lasry is more centrist.

Whoever secures the nomination will face Ron Johnson, the Republican incumbent, who says that climate change is a hoax and covid-19 is better tackled with deworming tablets than vaccines. The Democrats have made the race to unseat Mr Johnson tougher than it ought to be.

## North Carolina goes Hollywood

Any folksy, romantic [American bestseller](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/05/14/the-highway-code-tops-the-bestseller-lists-again) is bound to be made into a movie. But not necessarily a noteworthy one. (“The Horse Whisperer” or “The Bridges of Madison County” are two forgettable examples.) The latest is “Where The Crawdads Sing”, an adaptation of Delia Owens’s debut novel. The book has sold over 12m copies since its publication in 2018. The inevitable film, produced by Reese Witherspoon, is out in America now and in Britain on July 22nd.

Daisy Edgar-Jones, the British star of “[Normal People](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2020/04/29/a-faithful-careful-adaptation-of-sally-rooneys-normal-people)”, a television series, plays Kya, a poetic loner who grew up alone in a North Carolina marshland. In 1950s flashbacks, her abusive father abandons her; in 1969, she is tried for the murder of her ex-boyfriend (another Brit, Harris Dickinson).

Most of the novel’s mystery plot has survived the transfer to the big screen, but little of its much-praised authenticity. The film makes life in a backwoods shack seem like an idyllic glamping holiday. Such is Hollywood.

## Cold-war games on a summer’s day

Fifty years after it was played, actors in London will recreate one of the most [famous chess games](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2008/11/20/pawnography) in history. In the 1972 world championship [Bobby Fisher,](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2008/01/24/bobby-fischer) an idiosyncratic American prodigy, played Boris Spassky, a Russian who shunned the Communist Party. After 21 games Fischer convincingly defeated the defending champion. Thus ended 24 years of Soviet dominance. 

Chess was a political game during the cold war. Both players were under huge pressure to win. Henry Kissinger, later America’s secretary of state, encouraged Fischer to play. Mr Spassky, whose loss irked the Kremlin as much as his sympathy for dissidents, emigrated to France four years later. 

Game three of the match will be commemorated during ChessFest, held in Trafalgar Square on Sunday, by actors playing the 32 pieces. The American lost the first game and controversially forfeited the second, so his win in the third proved a turning point. Fischer died in 2008, but Mr Spassky can still enjoy the show.

## Weekend profile: Penny Mordaunt, Britain’s next prime minister?

Penny Mordaunt has emerged as the [bookies’ favourite](https://www.economist.com/interactive/2022/07/12/the-race-to-become-britains-next-pm) to succeed Boris Johnson as leader of the Conservative Party, and thus as Britain’s prime minister. Last week she finished second in the first two ballots of Conservative MPs, who next week will whittle down the five remaining candidates to a final pair. The party’s 100,000-or-so members will then have the final say, with the winner to be announced in early September. If Ms Mordaunt makes it that far, she stands a good chance of triumphing. Separate surveys conducted by ConservativeHome, a grassroots website, and YouGov, a pollster, found that she is the favourite among party members. Yet Ms Mordaunt is unknown outside Westminster. What do the Tories see in her?

Ms Mordaunt was born in 1973. Her mother died when she was 15, and her father, a former paratrooper, fell ill the following year, leaving her to care for her younger brother until her father remarried. She worked as a magician’s assistant to help fund her philosophy studies at the University of Reading. When she joined the leadership race, Ms Mordaunt said her “love and pride” of Britain was kindled as a nine-year-old in Portsmouth, as she watched the navy set sail for [war in the Falklands](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/04/02/the-falklands-war-resonates-40-years-on). Her naval interest seems preordained: she was named after <em>HMS Penelope</em>, a cruiser. She serves as a navy reservist, and was elected as the Conservative MP for Portsmouth North in 2010. 

Ms Mordaunt’s supporters say her rise reflects the party’s appetite for change after the scandal and decadence of Mr Johnson’s tenure. They describe her as hard-working and dutiful, provincial rather than metropolitan. She supported Brexit, but is not fervent about the divorce. In “Greater: Britain After the Storm”, a book she co-authored last year, she offers an affectionate portrait of modern Britain as a good-humoured land of the NHS, pubs and the Human Rights Act. Her policies tend to focus on local communities rather than grand national ideas. One of her ideas is for MPs to be given pots of money to distribute to good causes in their constituencies. She would like to see a bigger role for charities, and for the volunteers who rallied during covid-19 to be put to work permanently.

The video that announced her candidacy was subject to much mockery in Westminster. It featured rolling shots of Britain, set to “I Vow to Thee My Country”, a patriotic ditty. Party members were not so sniffy. Ms Mordaunt’s ideological ambiguity has made her an attractive default candidate for MPs who dislike Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor and current frontrunner, and Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, her main rival for that second place. Yet even her supporters admit she is untested, and that the success of her notional premiership would depend on whether she would be prepared to appoint strong rivals to big posts, or rely on yes-men—as Mr Johnson did.
