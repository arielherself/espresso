New data suggested that <strong>America’s</strong> economy shrunk for the second quarter in a row, putting the country in a [technical recession](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/07/14/even-if-gdp-shrinks-america-may-officially-avoid-a-downturn-for-now). GDP fell by an annualised rate of 0.9%, according to the first estimate of America’s Bureau of Economic Analysis, driven by decreases in private company investment. Higher consumer spending was not enough to counteract that. Officially, though, America is not in a recession: that is for the National Bureau of Economic Research to decide.

It was reported that <strong>Ukrainian troops</strong> destroyed a bridge that supplies <strong>Kherson</strong> in the south of their country, potentially [cutting off](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/03/ukraine-prepares-a-counter-offensive-to-retake-kherson-province) the Russian forces occupying it. Ukrainian officials said that Russia was trying to shift more troops there, from the east. Meanwhile, Russian forces appear to have captured Ukraine’s second-biggest power plant, at Vuhlehirsk, in the Donbas region. 

<strong>JetBlue</strong> agreed to buy <strong>Spirit</strong>, a rival American airline, for $3.8bn, after <strong>Frontier</strong>, another airline, pulled out of a bidding war. The deal will create America’s fifth-largest airline, which JetBlue bosses think will be able to compete with giants like American, United and Delta.

<strong>Centrica</strong>, the parent company of British Gas, reported a booming £1.3bn ($1.6bn) profit in the first half of 2022, compared to £262m ($318m) in the first half of last year. <strong>Shell</strong>, an [oil supermajor](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/07/25/state-run-oil-giants-will-make-or-break-the-energy-transition), also posted a record-breaking $11.5bn profit in the second quarter. Their profits reflect rising energy prices stoked by [Russia’s invasion of Ukraine](https://te.arielherself.xyz/ukraine-crisis), as households around the world struggle with [increased costs of living](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/04/21/a-guide-to-britains-cost-of-living-crunch). 

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

The coalition of right-wing parties predicted to win <strong>Italy’s</strong> election in September agreed that the party with the most votes among them would choose the next prime minister. According to <em>Politico</em>, that will probably be Brothers of Italy, a far-right party. Giorgia Meloni, its leader, would then replace Mario Draghi who [resigned last week](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/21/mario-draghi-italys-reformist-prime-minister-resigns) after losing a vote of confidence.

<strong>Meta</strong>, the [parent company](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/02/04/metamorphosis-facebook-and-big-tech-competition) of <strong>Facebook</strong>, reported its first-ever decline in quarterly revenues, which slipped by 1% year on year, to $28.8bn. Its user base held steady, but [TikTok](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/07/07/has-tiktok-burst-the-zuckerbubble), an up-and-coming rival, is nibbling away at its ad revenues. Meanwhile the Federal Trade Commission, America’s competition regulator, filed a complaint to stop Meta from taking over a virtual-reality firm.

<strong>DeepMind</strong>, an artificial-intelligence company owned by Alphabet, said it has predicted the structure of almost every known <strong>protein</strong>, paving the way for big biological breakthroughs. The company published a database of over 200m proteins’ structures, predicted by its AlphaFold AI. Figuring out [proteins’ shapes](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2021/07/31/remarkable-progress-has-been-made-in-understanding-the-folding-of-proteins) has been one of the biggest unsolved problems in biology. The new database should make it much easier for researchers to develop new medicines and other biotech innovations.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>$2,000, the cost of inscribing your name on a grenade to be dropped on Russian forces. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/07/27/how-crowdfunding-is-shaping-the-war-in-ukraine).

## America on the brink of recession

America’s latest GDP data, released on Thursday, showed that the economy contracted for a second straight quarter—the popular definition of a [recession](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/07/24/why-it-is-too-early-to-say-the-world-economy-is-in-recession). Higher consumer spending was not enough to make up for a decline in private company investment, leading to a 0.9% slump in GDP. Following a 1.6% decline in the first quarter, many argue that puts America in a recession.

Yet, the White House has [pre-emptively argued](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/07/14/even-if-gdp-shrinks-america-may-officially-avoid-a-downturn-for-now) that a contraction like this would not equal a recession. It is technically correct. The official determination of whether America is in recession is made by the National Bureau for Economic Research, which places much weight on the jobs market. America’s current unemployment rate of 3.6%, one of the lowest levels in seventy years, is not consistent with any notion of a downturn. But what matters most for voters is their perception of growth. And that does not look good: consumer sentiment has plunged. Many believe the economy is in bad shape, regardless of the data.

## MBS in Paris

Fresh from his official visit to Greece, Muhammad bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince and de facto ruler, heads to Paris on Thursday. He will be treated to dinner at the Elysée Palace by the French president, Emmanuel Macron.

Prince Muhammad has been wooing Western leaders in an effort to cast off his reputation as an autocratic butcher and to promote tourism to Saudi Arabia. This is his first visit to Europe since the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist, in Turkey in 2018. The trip comes only two weeks after President Joe Biden ditched his previous pledge to treat the kingdom as a pariah state by [making his own visit](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/07/12/what-does-the-middle-east-offer-america) there. 

The crown prince’s outreach has been helped by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Europe is struggling with a squeeze on supplies of [Russian gas](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter), and needs alternatives. To this end, Mr Macron recently agreed a diesel deal with Muhammad bin Zayed, president of the United Arab Emirates. With Prince Muhammad in Paris, though, human-rights activists will be dismayed as realpolitik prevails.

## Ukraine celebrates its statehood

On Thursday Ukraine marks a national day of “statehood”, a holiday announced in happier times last summer by Volodymyr Zelensky, the president. When [Russia invaded](https://te.arielherself.xyz/ukraine-crisis) in February, the very idea of Ukrainian statehood seemed in doubt. But after Ukraine’s army saw off the Russians from Kyiv, that is no longer the case.

Indeed, there is reason for cautious optimism. Russian forces remain on the offensive in Donetsk, a province in eastern Ukraine, attacking along the Siversk-Bakhmut line, a north-south axis that protects the cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk. But they have made “virtually no progress over the past three weeks”, according to Rochan Consulting, a firm tracking the war. Ukraine has also stepped up its counter-attacks in [Kherson province](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/03/ukraine-prepares-a-counter-offensive-to-retake-kherson-province), in the south, blowing up bridges to cut off Russian forces west of the Dnieper river. It is unclear whether this marks the start of a long-awaited full Ukrainian counter-offensive in the province. But either way, it imposes an unpleasant dilemma on Russia: shore up the lines in Kherson, or keep feeding soldiers into the Donetsk meat-grinder?

## Mixed results for Big Tech

Tech stocks have [tumbled](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/05/14/tech-bubbles-are-bursting-all-over-the-place) over the past year. The Nasdaq 100 index has fallen by around 25% since January. Investors have therefore paid keen attention to the earnings reports of America’s five tech giants this week.

On Tuesday Alphabet, Google’s parent company, announced second-quarter revenue of $69.7bn, up 13% year-on-year. That was lower than expected, but investors did not mind: they had feared a meltdown in the online-ad industry after Snap and Twitter posted poor results last week. But those fears materialised on Wednesday when Meta, parent to Facebook and Instagram, reported its first-ever quarterly decline. Year-on-year revenue fell by 1% to $28.8bn. Its share price fell on the news.

Things look rosier in the cloud-computing and enterprise markets. Though Microsoft’s revenue, reported on Tuesday, fell short of expectations, bosses expect “double-digit” revenue growth this fiscal year. That bodes well for Amazon, the cloud market leader, which publishes earnings on Thursday. The outlook for Apple, which also reports on Thursday, is less bright: rising [inflation](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/06/19/peoples-inflation-expectations-are-rising-and-will-be-hard-to-bring-down) may temper demand for its expensive gadgets.

## The Commonwealth Games struggle for relevance

The Commonwealth Games, which begin in Birmingham on Thursday, are sometimes referred to as “the friendly games”. But congeniality counts for little in sport.

The competition is struggling for relevance, thanks to a host of other, more exciting rivals. (Athletics wrapped up its World Championships on July 24th.) The Commonwealth Games are also expensive. Britain’s government stepped in at a cost of £778m ($940m) after Durban, in South Africa, which was to have been the first African host, was stripped of its hosting duties in 2017 amid financial problems. And then there is the Commonwealth itself, a legacy of the British empire that some see as a colonial relic.

The games’ organisers promise a sweep of changes. The next competition, in 2026, will take place not in one city, but across the Australian state of Victoria. They may also allow hosts to propose new sports that have local relevance. Canada, for instance, which wants to host the centenary event in 2030, could add lacrosse. But if these efforts fail, the games risk becoming one of sport’s also-rans.
