<strong>Ukraine </strong>said more than 800 Russian soldiers died in the past day amid intense fighting in the [eastern region of Donetsk](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/01/04/a-russian-warlords-savagery-is-sending-a-loud-message-to-moscow), where Russia continued assaults on the towns of [Bakhmut](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/12/06/russia-is-hurling-troops-at-the-tiny-ukrainian-town-of-bakhmut), Kostiantynivka and Kurakhove. Meanwhile, <strong>France</strong> promised to provide Ukraine with armoured combat vehicles to help in the war against Russia. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, expressed his gratitude but urged allies to provide heavier weapons, such as tanks.

<strong>Kevin McCarthy </strong>offered concessions to the twenty right-wing Republicans blocking his election as the Speaker of America’s House of Representatives as the stalemate entered its third day. Mr McCarthy [lost a sixth ballot](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/01/04/what-the-kevin-mccarthy-saga-means-for-americas-congress) of House members on Wednesday, with the rebels supporting Byron Donalds, a second-term congressman. Mr McCarthy needs to win over at least 16 of them when voting restarts on Thursday. 

<strong>Amazon</strong> said it would sack more than 18,000 employees, up from the 10,000 it had previously planned. That represents just 1% of Amazon’s workforce, but counts as the biggest purge yet for a tech firm during a deepening [slump](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/05/14/tech-bubbles-are-bursting-all-over-the-place) in the sector. Andy Jassy, the e-commerce giant’s boss, blamed the “uncertain economy” and excessive hiring in recent years. [Salesforce](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2020/12/05/salesforce-gets-some-slack), a big software firm, meanwhile cut 10% of its workforce.

The funeral of <strong>Benedict XVI</strong>, pope from 2005 until his resignation in 2013, took place in the Vatican, presided over by his successor Pope Francis. Before the ceremony, about 200,000 people had queued to see [Benedict’s](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/12/31/pope-benedict-xvi-was-an-iron-fist-in-a-white-glove) body lying in state. He will be buried in a crypt beneath St Peter’s Basilica. 

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

Though American <strong>inflation</strong> eased in the past few months, rate-setters at the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> stressed that “substantially more evidence of progress” was needed before they halt [interest-rate rises](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/12/20/the-year-of-the-rate-shock), according to minutes released on Wednesday from their December meeting. Separately, a survey of managers showed that American <strong>manufacturing activity</strong> contracted in December for a second consecutive month.

<strong>China </strong>said it had [shared data](https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2023/01/04/all-around-the-world-covid-surveillance-is-faltering) on the covid wave sweeping the country in recent weeks with “openness and transparency” amid international criticism. On Wednesday the World Health Organisation cautioned that China is underrepresenting the scale of its outbreak since its zero-covid policy was relaxed in December. President Joe Biden also expressed concerns, commenting that China is “very sensitive” when challenged on the issue of data-sharing. 

America approved the world’s first vaccine for <strong>honeybees </strong>to protect them from American foulbrood, a disease that ravages hives and for which there is no cure. The [shot works](https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2021/03/18/honeybees-run-vaccination-programmes-too) by incorporating bacteria into the royal jelly secreted by worker bees and fed to the queen. That ensures larvae have immunity when they hatch. The breakthrough could boost the production of food that relies on honeybee pollination. 

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 46%, the share of people in Britain saying that immigration has a positive effect on the country, up from around 35% in 2015. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2023/01/03/the-impact-of-brexit-in-charts).

## Tech’s annual jamboree in Sin City

On Thursday the Consumer Electronics Show kicks off in Las Vegas. Some 100,000 people from over 170 countries are expected to take the opportunity to play with the latest gadgetry from more than 3,000 companies. As well as the usual launches of consumer-tech products, the glitzy event will see carmakers [showcasing flashy new features](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/01/08/cars-meet-chips-in-sin-city). In 2022, GM and Mercedes-Benz announced innovations to their electric vehicles. One attraction this year will be a race around the Las Vegas Speedway between cars driven by artificial intelligence.

But the show comes at a rough time for the tech industry. Share prices were battered in 2022; the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index [fell](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/12/24/how-techs-defiance-of-economic-gravity-came-to-an-abrupt-end) by about one-quarter. Firms from Amazon to Zillow have announced layoffs. And 2023 offers little hope for a rebound: analysts forecast that 40 of the world’s 100 biggest technology firms will see revenues shrink. That is no mood for a party, even in Vegas.

## Mounting tensions in Jerusalem

A visit by Israel’s national-security minister to one of the world’s most contentious religious sites has highlighted the radical tendencies of Binyamin Netanyahu’s new government. On Tuesday [Itamar Ben-Gvir](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/11/03/who-is-itamar-ben-gvir-israels-kingmaker), leader of an ultra-nationalist party in Mr Netanyahu’s coalition, visited Jerusalem’s Temple Mount, near the al-Aqsa mosque, despite warnings of violent protests. So far these have not materialised. But the action, condemned by Arab regimes, has led the United Arab Emirates to postpone a proposed visit by Mr Netanyahu that had been scheduled for next week.

Mr Ben-Gvir’s portfolio gives him control of police and a new paramilitary “national guard”, while other far-right ministers plan to expand the construction of settlements in the occupied West Bank. That risks further escalating tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. Mr Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, is now beholden to his [firebrand partners](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/10/the-changing-nature-of-israeli-politics) and finding it difficult to rein them in.

## North Korea’s nuclear weapons

North Korea started the year with a bang, testing a “super-large multiple rocket system”. Kim Jong Un, the country’s dictator, boasted that it could carry a nuclear payload to anywhere on the Korean peninsula. He also called for an “exponential increase” in North Korea’s nuclear arsenal.

This suggests that North Korea intends to spend 2023 as it did the previous year: testing new weapons and [honing its ability to use them](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/10/18/north-korea-is-preparing-for-another-nuclear-test-or-many). The stock response from South Korea and America—issuing stern threats and matching North Korean muscle-flexing with reciprocal displays of force—is also unlikely to change. Far from de-escalating, Yoon Suk-yeul, South Korea’s president, has said the country should consider suspending a five-year-old agreement with North Korea that limits military exercises. Seventy years after the armistice that silenced the guns of the Korean war in 1953, peace seems a distant prospect.

## A death-penalty case in South Carolina

Lethal injection can be a gruesome way to die. In America, where it is the main [method of capital punishment](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/12/15/south-carolina-wants-to-execute-an-inmate-by-firing-squad), such executions are often botched. Drug manufacturers, wanting nothing to do with the practice, have largely stopped supplying the necessary ingredients. That has left some states scrambling for alternatives. In 2020 South Carolina joined Mississippi, Oklahoma and Utah in allowing executions by firing squad—a rare method used to execute only three people since 1976, all in Utah—when lethal injections are unavailable.

But Richard Moore, a death-row inmate faced with a choice between firing squad and South Carolina’s 110-year-old electric chair, argues that neither method is constitutional. On Thursday the state’s supreme court will consider whether he can be executed by firing squad. Whatever the court decides, such cases will only hasten a [reconsidering of capital punishment](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2021/01/21/use-of-the-death-penalty-in-america-may-be-ending) in America altogether. Thirty-seven states have either abolished the death penalty or executed no prisoners in more than a decade. Capital punishment may be approaching its last gasp.

## Dhaka Lit Fest is back

Since it began in 2011, the annual celebration of Bangladesh’s literary culture has faced some severe challenges. Most notably, in 2015 many speakers dropped out following a spate of [attacks on secular writers](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2015/05/14/the-third-casualty) by machete-wielding Islamists. Since then the avowedly secular festival has pitted itself as a defender of free speech in a publishing industry dominated by Islamic books and religious censorship.

After a three-year covid hiatus, on Thursday the festival returned with an impressive line-up. [Abdulrazak Gurnah](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2021/10/07/abdulrazak-gurnah-wins-the-nobel-prize-in-literature-for-2021), a Nobel-prizewinning author and Tilda Swinton, a British actress, join acclaimed South Asian writers such as [Shehan Karunatilaka](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/08/18/shehan-karunatilaka-returns-with-another-thrilling-satire), Amitav Ghosh, Saad Z. Hossain and Geetanjali Shree, who won the International Booker prize in 2022.

But organisers face a backlash against newly introduced ticket prices. And critics charge that the festival fails to address the[ government’s ](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2021/03/27/as-it-turns-50-bangladesh-is-doing-well-despite-its-politicians)draconian [censorship laws](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2021/03/06/indias-government-follows-bangladeshs-in-policing-social-media). Speaking out, though, risks the event, sponsored by the culture ministry, being cancelled for good.
