In an extraordinary fiscal intervention, <strong>Kwasi Kwarteng</strong>, Britain’s [chancellor of the exchequer](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/07/kwasi-kwarteng-is-bold-brainy-and-weird), unveiled a “<strong>mini-budget</strong>” for boosting growth through [large tax cuts](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/22/liz-trusss-selective-reaganomics-wont-work) and increased government spending. The British pound dropped to a 37-year low in response, as investors fretted over the massive borrowing that will be required to fund his proposals. Britain’s Debt Management Office confirmed that the government will borrow an extra £72bn ($80bn) this year to fund the package. Rachel Reeves, the Labour Party’s shadow chancellor, criticised the mini-budget for rewarding the rich.

Reports emerged of residents in four Russian-controlled parts of <strong>Ukraine</strong> being coerced into voting in favour of joining <strong>Russia</strong>, after <strong>referendums</strong> [began on Friday](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/23/voting-begins-in-four-sham-referendums-in-ukraine). Ukrainian officials said that people were being intimidated by armed groups, forbidden from leaving certain areas until polls close on Tuesday, or threatened with losing their jobs. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said that the results would be “unequivocally condemned”.

​​<strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong>, the president of the European Commission, said the EU had “tools” to deal with undemocratic governments—a thinly veiled warning to <strong>Italy</strong> ahead of its election on Sunday. A hard-right alliance led by Giorgia Meloni is [expected to win](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/22/how-afraid-should-europe-be-of-giorgia-meloni). Matteo Salvini, the head of one of the parties in Ms Meloni&#x27;s bloc, called the comments “shameful arrogance”.

China’s foreign ministry said that <strong>America</strong> was sending “very wrong, dangerous signals” on <strong>Taiwan</strong>, after Antony Blinken, the American secretary of state, met with Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. Mr Blinken is said to have stressed the importance of [maintaining peace over the island](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/08/11/how-the-crisis-over-taiwan-will-change-us-china-relations), which China claims as its own. 

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Russia</strong> announced some exemptions from its [civilian draft](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/21/vladimir-putin-declares-a-partial-mobilisation), amid attempts by large numbers of men to leave the country and concerns from companies over staffing shortages. Many of those who work in technology, banking and telecommunications will not be sent to the frontline in Ukraine. Meanwhile Russia’s European neighbours—Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland—collectively ruled out expanding their asylum categories to include fleeing Russians.

<strong>NATO</strong> brought in reserve troops for peacekeeping training in <strong>Kosovo</strong>, amid fears of possible unrest reuniting in a dispute between the country’s government and its Serbian minority. During the summer, Serbs in Kosovo protested about a new rule requiring them to use state-issued car licence plates, the implementation of which was subsequently delayed until October. <strong>Serbia</strong> refuses to acknowledge Kosovo’s independence. 

<strong>Silvio Berlusconi, </strong>a former Italian prime minister, was widely condemned at home and abroad after saying that Vladimir Putin had been “pushed” into invading Ukraine, and sought only to impose a &quot;government made up of decent people” on the country. Mr Berlusconi, a long-time associate of Mr Putin&#x27;s, insisted that his views had been “oversimplified”. His Forza Italia party is part of a [right-wing coalition](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/22/giorgia-meloni-and-her-brothers-of-italy-look-set-to-win-the-next-election) expected to win Italy&#x27;s general election, on Sunday.

## Democrats eye gains in the Senate

In the past 22 American [midterm elections](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/07/the-democrats-are-likely-to-lose-the-house-but-keep-the-senate), the incumbent president’s party has gained Senate seats on only six occasions. Democrats are hoping that Republicans’ [subpar and incendiary](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/08/24/donald-trumps-endorsements-are-reshaping-the-republican-party) candidates will make November 8th the seventh. Among the competitive races is North Carolina, where Donald Trump will appear at a rally on Friday alongside Ted Budd, a Republican congressman, gun-store owner and co-sponsor of a bill to ban abortions after 15 weeks nationwide.  
  
 Though Republicans have carried North Carolina in nine of the ten most recent presidential elections, opinion polls have Mr Budd locked in a dead heat with his Democratic opponent, Cheri Beasley, a mild-mannered former state judge. <em>The Economist</em>’s forecast model puts Mr Budd on top, but his [chances are dwindling](https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/us-midterms-2022/forecast/senate/north-carolina). The threat of more abortion bans has [energised Democrats](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/08/30/americas-fight-over-abortions-has-fired-up-women-voters) across the country. Just 46% of Americans [support the sort Mr Budd has sponsored](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/22/republicans-abortion-proposal-could-backfire). The issue looks likely to help Democrats retain—and perhaps expand—their Senate majority. Overall, [our model](https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/us-midterms-2022/forecast/senate) suggests Democrats will pick up one Senate seat in November.

## Russia prepares to absorb parts of Ukraine

On Friday Russian-installed puppet governments in four [occupied](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/21/vladimir-putin-declares-a-partial-mobilisation) Ukrainian territories began asking residents whether they want to join Russia. As with a similar sham referendum in [Crimea](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2014/03/15/a-predictable-outcome) in 2014, a “yes” vote would be a pretext for formal annexation.

The polls will be open for five days in Russian-controlled parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. The process is unlikely to be free or fair. Russian media have published questionable polls predicting between 80-91% support. Ukrainian authorities claim the Russians’ own polling suggests that no more than 10% of the population will turn out. In Zaporizhia armed policemen will accompany election officials in door-to-door voting. 

In a televised address on September 21st President [Vladimir Putin](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/21/vladimir-putin-vows-to-send-more-invaders-the-west-should-arm-ukraine-faster) said he would guarantee the annexation process with Russia’s full range of weapons, including nuclear ones. Russia’s Western adversaries have condemned the plans; France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, called the process “a parody”. Ukraine is urging its citizens not to take part, and for adult men to leave the regions in question—to avoid being mobilised against their own country.

## Britain’s big mini-budget

On Friday [Kwasi Kwarteng](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/07/kwasi-kwarteng-is-bold-brainy-and-weird), the new British chancellor, launched a budget in all but name. Dubbed a mere “fiscal event”, Mr Kwarteng’s speech unveiled a host of tax cuts and handouts that dwarf many bona fide budgets. He announced a reduction in the top rate of income tax from 45% to 40%, alongside a cut to the basic rate. The chancellor also confirmed a reduction in stamp duty, a levy on house sales, and promised to roll back a recent rise in national insurance contributions.

The radical cuts will be welcomed by voters facing high inflation and rising interest rates. But government coffers will suffer. Mr Kwarteng confirmed that the government’s [energy rescue plan](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/08/britains-government-signs-a-giant-blank-cheque-for-energy-bills) is expected to cost over £60bn ($67bn) in its first six months from October. And unlike a proper budget, the “fiscal event” was not accompanied by a full economic forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility, an official watchdog. Neither the wonks, nor the opposition, were happy with that.

## China unleashes its strategic pork reserves

The philosophy of China’s president, known as [Xi Jinping Thought](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/09/22/how-xi-jinping-might-change-the-communist-partys-constitution), can be maddeningly vague. Its aims include realising “the people’s new aspirations for a better life”, which does not narrow things down much. But on occasion China’s policymaking apparatus fleshes out these skeletal generalities. According to the National Development and Reform Commission, a planning agency, one of the people’s expectations for a better life is [stable pork prices](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2019/09/12/soaring-pork-prices-hog-headlines-and-sow-discontent-in-china). 

With the National Day holiday approaching on October 1st, the commission wants to help families afford to feast on their favourite meat. On Friday it released thousands of tonnes of frozen pork from the state’s reserves, for the third time this month. This should help restrain prices, which were 22% higher in August than a year ago. The commission has also promised to crack down on price-gouging and collusion among food suppliers. It seems producers’ aspirations for a better life can make it harder to meet everybody else’s.

## Federer’s farewell

After 24 years and more than 1,500 matches, on September 15th Roger Federer announced he was retiring from professional tennis. Despite the inevitability of the announcement—the 41-year-old has been injured for more than a year—it still shocked the tennis world. Mr Federer has inspired books, breathless profiles and more encomiums than any other player on the circuit. Many fans consider him the greatest ever to wield a racket. 

Some have spent a fortune to watch his final appearance, a doubles match on Friday at the Laver Cup in London. The five-year-old tournament pits top European players against their global counterparts; Mr Federer, who is Swiss, was one of its founders. Rod Laver, an Australian legend after whom the tournament is named, will be in the audience. Mr Federer’s [greatest rivals](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2021/11/23/is-this-the-beginning-of-a-new-era-for-mens-tennis) will be there too. Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal will be his teammates; Mr Nadal will even be his doubles partner. Mr Federer says the cup is the perfect platform for him to “properly say goodbye”.
