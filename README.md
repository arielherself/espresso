 **Britain** recorded one of its hottest days ever on Monday, with temperatures reaching 38°C. They were expected to climb higher still on Tuesday, to 42°C. Elsewhere around Europe temperatures soared above 45°C in several places, intensifying **wildfires** around the Mediterranean as well as [fears about climate change](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/04/16/in-chilly-parts-of-europe-heatwaves-strengthen-environmentalism). Melting roads and warped railway lines disrupted transport in parts of the continent. **Australia** meanwhile released a five-yearly report on its environment that blamed climate change and particularly the bushfires of 2019-20 for an 8% increase in the number of species threatened with extinction.

 **Gazprom** told customers in Europe it could not guarantee **gas supplies** because of “extraordinary” circumstances. Reuters reported that the Russian state-owned gas giant has retroactively declared force majeure, from June 14th. Flows via Nord Stream 1, a major pipeline to Europe, had been halted already, for maintenance. The worry now is that they may not resume, exacerbating the continent’s [energy crisis](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/14/europes-winter-of-discontent).

 **Goldman Sachs** reported that net income in the second quarter fell by 47% from the same period a year ago, to $2.9bn. Its investment-banking revenues dropped by 41% amid a drought of public listings, though stockmarket volatility boosted trading revenues by 32%. Goldman said it would slow hiring and possibly resume culling underperformers, a practice it had [abandoned in the pandemic](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/the-latest-industry-to-suffer-labour-shortages-investment-banking/21808714).

 **China** reported almost 700 new cases of **covid-19** on Monday, its highest tally in nearly two months. Most cases were recorded in the southern region of Guangxi and the north-western province of Gansu. Lockdowns have been imposed in both places. In Shanghai, the financial capital, officials launched a campaign to test around 20m people to [prevent another lockdown](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/16/in-stamping-out-covid-china-has-stomped-on-confidence).

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

 **Ghana** confirmed two cases of the **Marburg virus** , a highly contagious disease similar to Ebola. It is only the second time the illness has been detected in west Africa. The announcement followed tests by the World Health Organisation on samples from two patients who died in late June. At least 90 of their contacts are being monitored by health authorities.

Chuck Schumer, America’s Senate majority leader, said he would call a vote on a $52bn package of subsidies to **chipmakers** as soon as Tuesday. Two years in the making, the legislation was prompted by fears that China’s semiconductor industry has [raced ahead](https://www.economist.com/business/america-has-a-plan-to-throttle-chinese-chipmakers/21808959) of America’s. Senators are expected to vote on a pared-down version of the bill, which scraps other provisions related to American competitiveness.

 **Euromoney** , a British financial news company, accepted a takeover bid of around $2bn from private-equity groups Astorg and Epiris, a rare deal amid economic uncertainty. If accepted by shareholders, the deal will see the business split into two, with Astorg taking Euromoney’s price-reporting division and Epiris taking the rest.

 **Fact of the day:** 216,000, the estimated number of victims of child abuse at the hands of the Catholic church in France between 1950 and 2020. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/14/the-catholic-church-should-scrap-the-requirement-for-priestly-celibacy).

## Bannon in the dock

When Steve Bannon, a former adviser to Donald Trump, ignored a subpoena from the House of Representatives committee investigating the [Capitol riot on January 6th](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/10/congresss-capitol-riot-hearing-confirms-donald-trumps-complicity) 2021, he was indicted by prosecutors for contempt of Congress. His trial begins on Monday. Combative as ever, Mr Bannon has promised to turn the charges into the “misdemeanour from hell”. He may come to regret that bullishness: if convicted, he faces up to two years in prison.

Congressional investigators intended to ask Mr Bannon about efforts to steal the 2020 election, which culminated in the riot. Before the vote, he presciently predicted that Mr Trump would declare victory before ballot-counting had finished. On January 5th, he warned that “all hell is going to break loose tomorrow”.

The committee has already painstakingly documented how Mr Trump and his cronies [subverted democracy](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2022/06/24/what-impact-can-the-january-6th-committee-have). What the Department of Justice does with that information is a separate question. It will have to decide if there is enough [criminal culpability to indict Mr Trump](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/16/the-criminal-case-against-donald-trump). 

## India elects a new president

The president of India is a largely ceremonial role but elections for the post, which took place on Monday, offer a chance for opposition parties to score a rare victory over the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Seventeen parties have united behind Yashwant Sinha, a former BJP finance and foreign minister who has turned into one of the party’s fiercest critics. 

Mr Sinha, however, is unlikely to prevail once a winner is announced later in the week. The BJP and its allies enjoy a big advantage in the electoral college that elects the president. Moreover, their candidate, Draupadi Murmu, an <em>adivasi</em> (ie, a member of a long-neglected tribal community) is already testing the opposition’s unity. Ms Murmu would be the first <em>adivasi</em> (and only the second woman) to be elected to the role. Voting against her is making some opposition legislators queasy. And for the BJP—its eyes perhaps fixed more firmly on future electoral success than on making history—Ms Murmu could draw in more tribal voters in 2024’s national elections. 

## London’s latest IPO

GlaxoSmithKline, the British pharmaceutical giant, is splitting up. On Monday it spun off its consumer-health unit—which hawks pharmacy mainstays like toothpaste and anti-inflammatories—as a separate company, called Haleon. The new firm [started trading on the London Stock Exchange](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/07/18/haleons-listing-shows-the-woes-of-the-london-stock-exchange) with a valuation of a little over £30.5bn ($36.4bn), making Haleon one of Britain’s biggest businesses. 

The listing was London’s largest initial offering in a decade. The bourse’s IPO track record has badly lagged behind those of America, Asia and even continental Europe recently. This means the companies it has listed are older, stable businesses rather than the faster-growing technology companies seen on its competitors. Monday’s listing, which cleaves off a part of one of Britain’s most valuable firms, does nothing to solve the problem of how to attract tech firms. Even Arm, a UK-based chip designer, is considering whether to make its primary listing in New York rather than at home.

## British barristers go on strike

Courts in England and Wales may [grind to a halt](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/02/12/unless-lawyers-are-paid-better-courts-will-grind-to-a-halt). On Monday criminal barristers will begin a five-day walk-out, in the final week of a month of progressively longer strikes. 

They are protesting about low pay. The state compensates defence barristers when their clients cannot afford legal representation. Barristers have not had a raise in years. A review last November recommended a 15% increase for cases filed from October this year. But many lawyers want a bigger raise, and they want it to apply to cases already under way. A spokesman for the association that represents most criminal barristers says that, should the government not come back with a better offer, walk-outs will continue indefinitely, every other week, starting in August.

The upshot is that Britain is failing to give everyone a prompt hearing. The covid-19 pandemic had already led to big backlogs; walk-outs will make them worse. 

## Next-generation vaccines could end boosters

Few vaccines are “one-and-dones”—[boosters](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2021/09/14/booster-shots-are-they-necessary) are usually required. Each additional dose means lower uptake and a less immunised population. But suppose you could receive all your doses at once, from a single jab? A new paper in <em>Science Advances</em>, a journal, explains how scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed self-boosting vaccine technology. It employs hollow microparticles made of a biodegradable polymer. These microparticles contain the vaccine, which is released when the outer shell breaks down.

By adjusting the composition of the polymer, the researchers can determine exactly how long this process takes, whether days or months. This would be a game-changer, not only for [future pandemics](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/04/09/asias-outbreaks-show-that-omicron-is-deadly-in-unvaccinated-people) but also for vaccination programmes in remote regions where it is harder to deliver boosters. It seems too good to be true. But over the past two years vaccine-makers have proved that, with enough funding, they can work wonders.
