<strong>Ukrainian</strong> officials said that electricity supplies had been restored in Kharkiv, the country’s second-biggest city, and water was back on in Kyiv, the capital, after a wave of <strong>Russian</strong> missile attacks on the country’s infrastructure on Friday. An 18-month-old boy was among four people killed by the strikes in Kryvyi Rih, in the south. General Valery Zaluzhny, the head of Ukraine’s armed forces, [told <em>The Economist</em>](https://te.arielherself.xyz/ukraines-fateful-winter) this week that the Russians were preparing for a major offensive in the next few months, including “another go at Kyiv”.

A congressional committee charged with investigating the Capitol riot of January 6th 2021 will reportedly recommend that <strong>Donald Trump</strong> be charged with insurrection. The Department of Justice, which would handle such a prosecution and is conducting its own probe, is not obliged to follow the suggestion. The former president denies any wrongdoing; a spokesperson called [the proceedings](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/06/10/congresss-capitol-riot-hearing-confirms-donald-trumps-complicity) “show trials”.

Polls opened in <strong>Tunisia’s</strong> first parliamentary elections since the legislature was closed by Kais Saied, the country’s president, in July 2021. The opposition is boycotting the vote, decrying it as a farce designed to cement Mr Saied’s control. It is unclear how many Tunisians will turn out—a referendum on [constitutional reforms](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/08/25/dictators-and-utopians-are-fond-of-fiddling-with-constitutions) granting the president unchecked power attracted only 28% of eligible voters.

With [cases of <strong>covid-19</strong>](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/12/13/how-chinese-people-are-dealing-with-the-spread-of-covid-19) on the rise in China, certain pupils in Shanghai will be sent home from Monday to continue studying online. The ruling affects those in kindergartens and child-care centres, plus older year groups that are not due to graduate in the summer. A wave of infections is breaking over the country, after the government largely ditched its zero-covid policy.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

Elon Musk, <strong>Twitter’s</strong> [new owner](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/12/01/elon-musk-is-showing-what-a-waste-of-time-twitter-can-be), said that journalists banned from the social-media platform for writing about him would have their accounts reinstated. The European Commission had threatened sanctions if “red lines” were crossed. <strong>Vera Jourova</strong>, the commissioner for values and transparency, said the suspensions could violate the EU’s Digital Services Act—a draft law targeting big tech that could come into force next year.

<strong>Peru’s</strong> congress rejected legislation by the new president to bring forward elections by more than two years, to December 2023—a proposal intended to quell protests over the ouster of [Pedro Castillo](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/12/07/after-a-bungled-coup-attempt-perus-president-falls), the president. At least 20 people have died in the clashes; two cabinet ministers have resigned. About 5,000 tourists have been stranded in Cusco, near Machu Picchu, after protesters stormed the airport.

<strong>Croatia</strong> beat <strong>Morocco</strong> 2-1 to claim third place in the football World Cup. Romantics were probably hoping for a win for the Moroccans, who had become [the first African or Arab squad](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/13/moroccos-world-cup-success-sparks-a-debate-about-arab-identity) to reach the semi-finals. But a Croatian team led by one of the modern game’s great players, Luka Modric, secured another impressive result, four years after being runners-up. The reigning champions, France, take on Argentina in [Sunday’s final](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/12/16/the-world-cup-final-pits-messi-against-mbappe).

<strong>Word of the week: </strong>friendshoring, a kind of reverse offshoring in which supply chains are redirected to stable, ideally allied countries. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/12/14/and-the-word-of-2022-is).

## What lies ahead in Ukraine

This week Russia launched a further barrage of rockets on Ukrainian infrastructure, as it seeks to disable the country’s power grid amid freezing winter temperatures. More surely lie ahead. But the strikes could also precede Russian moves on the battlefield. Ukraine’s top generals believe Russia is preparing [another big offensive](https://te.arielherself.xyz/ukraines-fateful-winter), possibly to begin as soon as January, that could come anywhere in the country. The question facing them is whether to launch a pre-emptive strike or wait to counter-attack.

Ukraine insists that the only way to conclude the war is a complete Russian retreat, from land seized this year and from territory it has occupied since 2014, including Crimea. But in private officials admit to other possible outcomes, with Ukrainian military advances leading to diplomacy. A European official says that ideally Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, would be persuaded that the war is unwinnable, and that prolonging it would risk even his pre-war holdings—Crimea and one-third of the eastern Donbas region—forcing him into talks. Yet compromise over Crimea in particular will be hard to swallow for an increasingly optimistic Ukraine.

## Sudan’s fitful democratic transition

Monday marks the fourth anniversary of the outbreak of protests that eventually toppled Omar al-Bashir, a genocidal dictator who ruled Sudan for three decades. The country’s indefatigable democracy activists will again take to the streets in a show of commemoration and defiance. After the revolution, the army accepted a power-sharing deal with civilians; three years later, as elections loomed, the generals [staged a coup](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/sudans-democratic-transition-is-upended-by-a-second-coup-in-two-years/21805857). Protesters have been on the streets [every week since](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/04/09/sudan-faces-collapse-three-years-after-the-fall-of-its-dictator).

Now they have further reason to be angry. Earlier this month leaders of the civilian bloc and the junta signed a new accord promising a fully civilian government and elections in two years. Activists are suspicious: the agreement was negotiated behind closed doors by a coterie of politicians and generals who are widely mistrusted. The most contentious issue––prosecution of the generals for genocide and crimes against humanity––will supposedly be dealt with later, sparking fears that it never will be.

## The science of pads and tampons

At any given time, about 300m of the world’s women are menstruating. Of these, three-quarters will be using a menstrual product—tampons, pads, pantyliners and so on—to regulate their flow. A typical woman who employs such devices will use around 15,000 of them during her life.

Yet rigorous studies into the composition of menstrual products are remarkably patchy. Official reports have found few dangers, and any serious health hazards would probably have come to light by now. Even a small risk, though, would affect many people. And in some parts of the world, from America to Kenya and South Korea, women have reported symptoms including shorter periods, cramps and rashes when using certain pads. The two largest makers of menstrual products say they give priority to safety, and deny using harmful chemicals. But companies’ verdicts on their own products can’t be taken as gospel. The onus is on scientists, regulators and public-health agencies to fill in the gaps in knowledge.

## An immigrant babysitter’s disquiet in “Nanny”

“Nanny”, a film that arrived on Amazon Prime on Friday, is a vivid psychological thriller about Aisha (Anna Diop), a Senegalese woman who works for a white family in New York. The child she looks after is sweet, but the mother doesn’t pay on time, and the father is a bit of a creep. Aisha stands up to her privileged employers, yet her discomfort grows like a storm, triggering nerve-jangling hallucinations.

The American director, Nikyatu Jusu, drew on her own experiences to evoke her character’s alienation (Ms Jusu’s parents hail from Sierra Leone). Aisha sends money to her son in Senegal, and though she finds glimpses of community in New York, the boy’s absence haunts her room in her employers’ sleek apartment. The first horror film to take the top jury prize for an American drama at the Sundance film festival, “Nanny” touches on class, race, labour and immigration, building slow-burn menace from Aisha’s growing dread.

## Weekend profile: Ekrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul facing prosecution

As the former head of his family’s construction company, Ekrem Imamoglu says he often saw projects get bogged down by politics. He says he entered politics to untangle the red tape. That line got him elected mayor of a suburb of Istanbul in 2014 as a member of Turkey’s main opposition outfit, the Republican People’s Party (CHP). Five years later Mr Imamoglu was elected mayor of the whole city, but only after Justice and Development (AK), the party of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, contested the initial vote. Mr Imamoglu [won the rerun election by a landslide](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2019/06/24/the-oppositions-new-star-deals-turkeys-president-a-stinging-blow). His victory was a heavy blow for Mr Erdogan, himself a former mayor of Istanbul who is fond of saying that “whoever wins Istanbul wins Turkey”. 

As mayor Mr Imamoglu has focused on quality-of-life issues in Europe’s most populous city, expanding the metro to ease traffic and improving storm-drainage to reduce flash-flooding. The president knows that the opposition’s successful management of Istanbul poses risks to his 20-year tenure in office, given that presidential elections are expected by June 2023. The CHP has yet to name a candidate to take on Mr Erdogan, and Mr Imamoglu has stayed mum on his ambitions for higher office. But polls suggest that he is one of the opposition politicians best placed to unseat Mr Erdogan at the ballot box.

Naturally charismatic, Mr Imamoglu is a rare unifying figure in Turkey’s polarised political landscape. He is religious and progressive. He is a Turk from the ultra-nationalist Black Sea region, but also appeals to minority voters like Kurds and Alevis. His appeal makes him a highly [dangerous rival to Mr Erdogan](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/06/09/as-elections-approach-turkeys-president-finds-enemies-everywhere). On December 14th a court in Istanbul convicted Mr Imamoglu of “insulting” the officials who had ordered the rerun of the Istanbul mayoral election, whom he had called “fools”. He was sentenced to two years and seven months in prison, and banned from holding political office. An appeal is under way, but if it fails the ruling could bar Mr Imamoglu from challenging Mr Erdogan and AK at any level.

Supporters of Mr Imamoglu think the case is politically motivated. But most analysts reckon that, if his conviction is overturned, it could rally voters behind him. After all, Mr Erdogan was catapulted to power after serving four months in prison for reading a religious poem. A ruling in Mr Imamoglu’s favour by the appeals court could just see him follow suit.
