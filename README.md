America’s House of Representatives and millions of ordinary citizens watched the eighth hearing of a panel investigating **the January 6th Capitol riots** , before it adjourned for a late-summer break. They heard [damning testimony](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/21/the-january-6th-committee-has-hobbled-donald-trump) about then-president Donald Trump and his [refusal to oppose the violence](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/10/congresss-capitol-riot-hearing-confirms-donald-trumps-complicity) committed in his name while it unfolded. Instead, witnesses said, he watched television, mainly Fox News. The security detail assigned to Mike Pence, then the vice-president, had meanwhile feared for their lives. Earlier on Thursday the Secret Service confirmed that it is subject to a criminal probe for having deleted messages exchanged by its agents that day.

Turkey said **Ukraine** and **Russia** will sign a deal on Friday in Istanbul to resume **grain exports** from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. Brokered by the UN and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, the agreement would [unblock about 18m tonnes of Ukrainian grain](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/21/odessas-port-may-soon-be-reopened) awaiting export. Russia’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports has sent global food prices surging and exacerbated world hunger.

 **Euro-zone business activity** went into reverse in July for the first time since February 2021. S&amp;P Global’s flash composite purchasing managers’ index, which measures both service sector and manufacturing companies in the euro zone, dropped to a 17-month low of 49.4 in July, a fall from 52 in June. Economists had expected a slight decline to 51, but the drop below 50, which indicates contraction, was unexpected.

Riot police removed protesters from the area around the president’s office in Colombo, **Sri Lanka** ’s capital, hours after [Ranil Wickremesinghe](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/21/sri-lanka-picks-a-new-president-to-replace-the-one-that-fled) was sworn in as president. Demonstrators have camped out there for months amid an economic crisis. There are fears that the show of force will reignite unrest. Meanwhile Dinesh Gunawardena, a senior lawmaker, was sworn in as the new prime minister.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

The lower house of **France’s** parliament approved an ambitious economic plan proposed by [Emmanuel Macron](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/07/frances-president-emmanuel-macron-decides-to-go-it-alone), the president, after four days of debate. The “purchasing power bill”, as it is known, is a bundle of measures meant to protect households from rapidly rising inflation, including tax-free bonuses for workers and a bump for pensions. It now must pass the Senate.

 **Joe Biden** tweeted that he was “doing great” after testing positive for **covid-19** . The American president, who will be 80 in November, has isolated himself in the White House and is experiencing “very mild symptoms”, according to his press secretary. He is also taking [Paxlovid](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/11/12/new-antiviral-drugs-mark-a-big-turning-point-in-the-covid-19-pandemic), an antiviral medication which reduces the risk of severe illness or death, she said.

 **Snap’s** share price fell by more than one-quarter in post-session trading after the [social-media firm](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/05/20/how-to-thrive-in-the-shadow-of-giants) delivered dismal second-quarter results. Revenues increased by 13%, to $1.1bn, from the same period last year. But Snap’s net loss widened to $422m, an increase of 178%. The firm declined to provide forecasts for future results, saying “forward-looking visibility remains incredibly challenging”. It added that it would “substantially” [slow hiring](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/06/02/is-big-techs-red-hot-jobs-market-about-to-cool).

 **Fact of the day:** three, the number of days each year that the average European has experienced temperatures above 38°C over the past five years. [Read the full article](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/07/21/a-rising-share-of-people-are-exposed-to-dangerously-high-temperatures).

## Trump plays kingmaker in Arizona

Donald Trump considers Blake Masters, a venture capitalist, to be “a great modern-day thinker!” On Friday the former president will [host a rally](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/21/the-january-6th-committee-has-hobbled-donald-trump) in Arizona alongside Mr Masters, who hopes to secure the Republican nomination for the upcoming Senate contest in the November mid-term elections. Together they will set out their plans to “save America”, as Friday’s rally is called.

Republicans aim to take the Senate at the mid-terms, and Arizona is one of the few competitive seats up for grabs. With Mr Trump’s backing, Mr Masters has a good chance of winning the GOP primary on August 2nd. Four-fifths of Republican candidates endorsed by Mr Trump in open primary contests have won their party’s nomination. But Mr Masters may fare less well in the general election. He recently claimed black people are responsible for gun violence and obliquely endorsed the so-called “[great replacement theory](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/05/16/what-is-the-great-replacement-right-wing-conspiracy-theory)”, warning that Democrats were aiming to “change the demographics of our country”. Polling suggests Mr Masters would lose to Mark Kelly, the Democratic incumbent, in November. Mr Trump may once again be leading his party astray.

## Russia’s long economic war

Any good general understands the importance of morale in a [protracted conflict](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/06/30/does-a-protracted-conflict-favour-russia-or-ukraine). So does Russia’s central bank. After the invasion of Ukraine in February, the bank acted decisively to show it was in control, doubling interest rates to 20% to save the rouble. As the currency stabilised, since then it has brought rates back down to 9.5%, in four large cuts. On Friday another, more modest cut, of 0.5 percentage points, is expected.

While much of the world is [raising rates](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/07/18/how-american-banks-are-responding-to-rising-interest-rates) amid soaring prices, Russia can get away with easing. That is because after the initial shock of sanctions, high energy prices have buoyed [the economy](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/06/10/russias-economy-appears-to-be-back-on-track). The rouble has strengthened against the dollar, helped by a ban on taking money out of the country. 

Inflation is slowing, too. That, though, is partly because Russians are buying less as Western goods disappear from the shelves. Eventually the stun-gunned economy will become less productive, real incomes will fall, and Russia’s central bankers will have to work harder to rally the troops.

## Twitter’s limbo earnings

Twitter’s results, due on Friday, are expected to be mixed. But regardless of what they say, investors’ minds will be elsewhere. They will be focused on the social-media platform’s messy legal dispute with Elon Musk, the billionaire who tried to buy the firm before changing his mind.

Twitter’s product, user numbers and revenues have [long been disappointing](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/11/with-or-without-elon-musk-twitter-is-overdue-a-shake-up). But Mr Musk’s expression of interest in buying the firm in April plunged Twitter into chaos. Staff revolted at the idea of working for a plutocrat. The promise of a $44bn payout for shareholders kept things moving. But earlier this month Mr Musk rescinded his offer.

Twitter is now in the unenviable position of trying to force a reluctant buyer to seal the deal. Its lawsuit against Mr Musk is off to a good start: despite his attempts to delay the trial until next year, a judge has ordered a hearing for October. In arguing against the delay Twitter’s lawyers said that the protracted uncertainty “inflicts harm on Twitter every hour of every day”.

## A Tory summer roadshow

Friday marks the first day of summer recess for Britain’s parliament. It returns on September 5th, the day the country will also learn the name of their new prime minister.

On Wednesday Conservative MPs finished whittling down a longlist of contenders to replace Boris Johnson as the [leader of their party](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/07/20/rishi-sunak-and-liz-truss-will-battle-to-be-britains-next-prime-minister) to two: Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, and Liz Truss, the foreign secretary. Both claim to be Thatcherites, but they are split on fiscal policy. She wants big tax cuts now, whereas he insists they must wait until inflation is tamed. [They differ in style](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/07/21/the-choice-between-rishi-sunak-and-liz-truss), too. Ms Truss is not a fluent public speaker while Mr Sunak is polished, albeit sometimes prickly. Their campaigns have kicked into gear: on Thursday, the candidates tried to win over Conservative councillors at a private event in London.

It is now up to the Conservative Party’s roughly 180,000 members to pick a winner. In an attempt to woo them Mr Sunak and Ms Truss will now spend the summer traipsing up and down the country for 12 hustings. The tour will kick off in Leeds—Ms Truss’ hometown—on July 28th. She is currently the favourite, and that might give her another advantage.

## “Nope” is a maybe

Jordan Peele, the writer and director of “Us” and “Get Out”—which earned him an Oscar for best original screenplay—has made another comedy-drama with a very short title: “Nope”, released in America on Friday.

Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer star as siblings who spot a flying saucer. Desperate for money, they set about becoming the first people to take an irrefutable photograph of an alien spaceship. Despite that simple premise the film is the most wide-ranging of Mr Peele’s oeuvre. “Nope” is sprinkled with interludes concerning the Wild West, animal training, child stars, social media and the erasure of black people from Hollywood history—all of which are shot beautifully by cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, of “Interstellar” and “Dunkirk”.

The result is intriguing, if sometimes rambling. Mr Peele struggles to weave everything together. But he is the rare Hollywood filmmaker who has too many ideas, rather than not enough.
