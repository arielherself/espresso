Crowds gathered outside Buckingham Palace and tributes poured in from foreign leaders after the death of <strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong> on Thursday. The queen [died](https://te.arielherself.xyz/obituary/2022/09/08/elizabeth-ii-never-laid-down-the-heavy-weight-of-the-crown), aged 96, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. Britain’s [oldest and longest-reigning monarch](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/08/the-death-of-elizabeth-ii-marks-the-end-of-an-era) acceded to the throne in 1952 and led Britain, and the Commonwealth, through a [period of intense change](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/09/08/britains-longest-serving-ruler-strengthened-the-monarchy). Prince Philip, her husband of 73 years, died in April 2021. Her funeral will take place in ten days’ time.

The queen’s eldest son, <strong>Charles</strong>, has [succeeded her as monarch](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2021/10/22/british-royal-succession-queen-elizabeth). In a statement King Charles III, who is due to address the country on Friday evening, said his mother&#x27;s death was a “moment of the greatest sadness”, and that the royal family would be “comforted and sustained” by its “knowledge of the respect and deep affection” in which the queen was held. Liz Truss, whom the queen appointed as prime minister only two days ago, called Elizabeth “the rock on which modern Britain was built.”

The <strong>European Central Bank</strong> raised <strong>interest rates</strong> by 0.75 percentage points for the first time on record, in an effort to curb soaring prices. Annual inflation in the euro area reached 9.1% in August, the highest ever, and continues to be driven up by the rising cost of energy and food. The ECB also revised its inflation expectations upwards.

America’s<strong> Department of Justice</strong> said it would appeal against a judge’s order to appoint an independent arbiter to review documents seized from <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> [estate in Florida](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/08/17/merrick-garland-is-not-naive-about-political-violence). The former president had requested the review, claiming the material was covered by [executive privilege](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/08/31/what-is-executive-privilege) and should therefore be withheld from investigators looking into his handling of classified material.

<strong>EY</strong>, one of the Big Four accounting firms, said it would[ spin off its fast-growing consultancy practice](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/06/23/in-eys-split-fortune-may-favour-the-dull) from the unfashionable audit side of the business. The break-up is intended partly to resolve conflicts of interest between the two. Approval must first come from the firm’s 13,000 partners, who can expect big payouts from a split. EY’s boss said the consulting business will aim to raise $11bn by floating a 15% stake.

A cheap [new vaccine](https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2022/09/08/a-new-malaria-vaccine-shows-promising-results) against <strong>malaria</strong> offers up to 80% immunity against the disease, according to clinical trial results. The jab, which was developed at the University of Oxford, could be rolled out next year, though a larger trial will determine its final approval. The Serum Institute of India, a partner on the project, could produce 200m doses of the jab per year, far more than existing manufacturers. Malaria killed 640,000 people in 2020.

<strong>Steve Bannon</strong>, a former aide to Mr Trump, turned himself in to face fraud charges in a New York court. The state-level prosecution closely follows a federal indictment from 2020 when Mr Bannon was accused of pocketing over $1m from a fundraising campaign to build a wall along the US-Mexico border. That indictment was terminated when Mr Trump pardoned Mr Bannon.

## The ECB raises interest rates

As private forecasters such as Oxford Economics downgrade Europe’s economic outlook to “recession”, the European Central Bank increased its main rates by 0.75 percentage points on Thursday. The reason is that consumer-price inflation is very high: the latest figure, for August, was 9.1% compared with a year earlier—way above the bank’s target of 2%. And the ECB said it expects to raise rates further. 

Is it the right call to increase interest rates at the beginning of a potential recession? After all, inflation in Europe is not the outcome of a booming economy, but mostly the result of exorbitant energy prices. These are starting to eat so deeply into consumers’ pockets and businesses’ tills that the economy is weakening fast on its own, even without the added burden of the ECB’s rate hikes. After underestimating the threat of inflation over the past year, the bank may now be underestimating the chances of a downturn.

## ​​Macron’s new democratic wheeze

The French president launches his latest brainchild on Thursday. The idea behind Emmanuel Macron’s <em>Conseil National de la Refondation </em>(roughly, national refoundation council) is to bring together politicians, unions, NGOs, business leaders and others to discuss solutions to big challenges including climate change and energy, employment, education and health. The council is designed to revive democratic participation after low turnout at presidential and parliamentary elections this year. It is also a riposte to those who accuse Mr Macron of excessive top-down rule and of not listening.

A heavyweight government team will attend the opening day in Marcoussis, a town near Paris. Sessions will be held in different settings across France for several months. Yet already all national [opposition parties](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/06/30/fresh-faces-on-the-far-right-and-left-fill-frances-parliament), and most unions, have boycotted the council, dismissing it as merely a talking shop. By [denying](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/06/19/emmanuel-macron-loses-his-parliamentary-majority) Mr Macron a majority at parliamentary elections in June, French voters sent a [clear message](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/06/22/what-president-emmanuel-macron-should-learn-from-losing-his-majority-in-the-french-parliament) that they want more collaborative rule. So far, opposition politicians seem wedded to the old confrontational culture.

## Two ways of counting in Thai

When Prayuth Chan-ocha, then head of Thailand’s army, staged a coup to overthrow an elected government in May 2014, few thought he would dominate politics for long. Yet on Thursday the country’s constitutional court heard arguments about how an eight-year term limit for prime ministers, codified in the constitution of 2017, might apply to Mr Prayuth.  
  
 The opposition argues that the prime minister’s time ran out last month. The same court suspended him from official duties on August 24th. But “Uncle Tu” argues that only the years after 2019, when his pro-army, royalist coalition won a majority in a general election, should count.  
  
 The pro-establishment court decided it needs to hear more evidence, and proposed to reconvene on September 14th. If it then decides in Mr Prayuth’s favour it would trigger anti-government protests, particularly among students. Economic troubles are already fanning discontent. Pheu Thai, the main opposition party, is eyeing a landslide in an election due next year, even after a change in the voting system. But in an autocracy built under the veil of democracy, it would be a miracle if Thais were soon allowed to get the government they actually want.

## Building back better in Beirut

Beirut is no stranger to a rebuild. In its tumultuous 5,000-year history the city has had to revamp itself seven times, most recently after the civil war, which ended in 1990, and a conflict with Israel in 2006. Government [negligence](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/04/beirut-marks-an-awful-anniversary-with-more-disaster) led to a huge blast that ravaged its port in 2020, killing over 200 people. The capital of Lebanon is now facing yet another reconstruction. But this time the wider world has had the chance to offer ideas. On Thursday Inspireli Awards, a Czech architecture firm, will announce the winners of its Beirut Port Renewal Competition. 

Judges will choose from 40 plans, from 19 countries, featuring outdoor theatres, museums, vast transport links and urban farms. The winning architects will collaborate with the port administration and the Lebanese government to hone their plans. The next test will be finding the money to pay for it all. It is an opportunity to reshape the future of a city, hopefully for good this time.

## Pinocchio is having his moment

In “Pinocchio”, released on Disney+ and in some cinemas on Thursday, Tom Hanks stars as Geppetto, a lonely Italian toymaker who carves a puppet that becomes a “real boy”. But Robert Zemeckis’s live-action remake of the classic animation, originally released by Disney in 1940, has company. Recent films bringing Pinocchio to life include Matteo Garrone’s drama from 2019 and “Pinocchio: A True Story”, a Russian version released earlier this year. Guillermo del Toro’s much-awaited stop-action version, using models, is expected to find its feet on Netflix in December.

What is behind this marionette mania? Perhaps the rise of AI, since Pinocchio is, after all, a kind of robot who runs amok. Or does his nose-extending mendacity strike a chord in an age of fake news? In Carlo Collodi’s “The Adventures of Pinocchio”, published in 1883, the nose-growing plays a surprisingly minor role. But the book’s most important message is just as relevant today: it is only by caring for others that we become fully human.
