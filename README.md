<strong>Vladimir</strong><strong> Putin</strong>, Russia’s president, declared the illegal <strong>annexation</strong> of four regions of Ukraine during an address at the Kremlin. The announcement followed [sham referendums](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/29/ignore-putins-fake-referendums-and-keep-helping-ukraine) in the areas. Mr Putin warned Ukraine and the West that the sovereignty of these areas would not be open to future negotiation as those living within them had become Russian citizens “forever”. <strong>America</strong> announced another round of sanctions on Russia, targeting the country’s defence and technology sectors.

<strong>China</strong> and <strong>India</strong> [abstained](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/30/vladimir-putin-illegally-annexes-four-ukrainian-oblasts) from condemning Russia’s annexation at the <strong>UN Security Council</strong>. America, which sponsored the draft resolution, had hoped that India would [take a more forceful line](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/why-wont-indias-government-condemn-vladimir-putin/21808074) towards Russia. Ten countries in the 15-member body voted for the measure, which Russia vetoed.

<strong>American shares</strong> continued their poor run. The S&amp;P 500 index shed 1.5% on Friday and 5.3% over the past quarter, notching up a [third straight quarter of losses](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/09/30/wall-street-extends-its-worst-run-since-the-financial-crisis) for the first time since 2008-09. Meanwhile, new figures showed that in August the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of annual inflation, the personal-consumption-expenditures price index, rose higher than expected, to 4.9%, excluding food and energy.

<strong>Hurricane</strong> Ian made landfall in South Carolina as a category-one storm, having left at least 21 people [dead in Florida](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/29/hurricane-ian-pummels-florida). Ian is forecast to move towards North Carolina before dissipating by Saturday evening near the border with Virginia. More than one million Floridians had their power restored, about half the number affected. More casualties are expected.

<strong>European</strong> energy ministers approved a [windfall tax](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/15/how-the-eu-intends-to-collect-windfall-profits-from-energy-firms) on most non-gas electricity producers and cuts to electricity consumption during peak hours, to temper soaring <strong>energy bills</strong>. They could not agree on a plan to [cap natural-gas prices](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/09/27/the-wrong-way-to-solve-europes-energy-crisis), which Germany opposes but France and others support. The tax is projected to raise €140bn ($137bn), to be redistributed to consumers. The measures will take effect in December.

<strong>Liz Truss</strong>, Britain’s new prime minister, met with the country’s independent economic watchdog on Friday, as she struggles to contain the [fallout](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/28/how-not-to-run-a-country) from last week’s [disastrous mini-budget](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically). The meeting failed to calm jitters as the pound weakened again and British pension schemes continued to raise funds by shedding assets. 

A <strong>suicide bombing</strong> at a private college in Afghanistan’s capital, <strong>Kabul</strong>, killed at least 19 people and wounded 27 others, according to police. The victims were students taking a mock university exam; most were women. While there was [a lull in such attacks](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/11/afghanistan-is-poorer-and-hungrier-than-a-year-ago) after the Taliban’s takeover of the country in August 2021, their frequency has recently increased. Many are claimed by Islamic State, a militant group.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>$50,000, the highest daily fee charged by Vishal Punjabi, a video-producer for Indian weddings, a booming business. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/09/29/matrimony-is-one-of-indias-biggest-businesses).

## The wrath of Ian

South Carolinians will wake up on Friday after an uneasy night’s sleep. Hurricane Ian is forecast to [hit the state](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/29/hurricane-ian-pummels-florida) later in the day, having moved out into the Atlantic from the east coast of Florida on Thursday. “Life-threatening” floods, storm surges and winds are expected.

Those Ian left behind must start to grapple with its destruction. By the time it slammed into Florida on Wednesday, with winds approaching 150mph (240kph), it was one of the most powerful storms ever to make landfall in the contiguous United States. It had already knocked out Cuba’s electricity grid. In Florida homes and roads were submerged and destroyed; millions lost access to power and drinking water. Ron DeSantis, the state’s governor, said that he was expecting casualties, though the death toll is not yet clear. Ian is also expected to be among the costliest hurricanes on record. But that record is accelerating too, as [climate change](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/29/is-climate-change-making-hurricanes-worse) makes hurricanes stronger, wetter and slower—and thus more damaging.

## Russia sets the stage for annexation

Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, announced the annexation of swathes of Ukrainian territory during a speech at the Kremlin, illegally claiming sovereignty over four Ukrainian provinces, despite not controlling any in its entirety. In farcical referendums overseen by soldiers, residents in occupied parts of Kherson, Zaporizhia, Donetsk and Luhansk provinces supposedly “voted overwhelmingly” to join Russia.

The [sham referendums](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/23/voting-begins-in-four-sham-referendums-in-ukraine) were hastily announced in mid-September after Russia’s battlefield losses. Alongside [partial mobilisation](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/21/vladimir-putin-declares-a-partial-mobilisation) and a new [nuclear threat](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/14/do-russias-military-setbacks-increase-the-risk-of-nuclear-conflict), they dramatically increase the risks of uncontrolled escalation. The West is scrambling to respond. More sanctions may be announced. Diplomats are pushing India, and even China, to isolate the Kremlin. A test will be how they vote on an American-sponsored UN Security Council resolution denouncing the annexation on Friday.

Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said he will not change his approach to the war. Russia’s land-grab would, however, slam the door on any future negotiations.

## Europe’s big decisions on energy

The agenda for the meeting of Europe’s energy ministers on Friday was already looking bulky. Then someone blew up [Nord Stream 1 and 2](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/02/22/the-west-imposes-swift-sanctions-on-russia-can-they-stop-a-war), the gas pipelines connecting Russia and Germany. The European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, has promised the “strongest possible response”. The possible act of sabotage has brought into sharp relief the vulnerability of Europe’s energy supply.

Getting off to a quick start, ministers approved emergency windfall taxes on energy companies to help tackle [rising gas and electricity bills](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/09/27/the-wrong-way-to-solve-europes-energy-crisis). They also agreed to a 5% mandatory cut in electricity use during peak hours. For the remainder of the day they will hammer away at the more divisive idea of a cap on gas prices: either across the board or limited to Russian imports. But the attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines—a reminder of Russia’s willingness to wage crippling energy warfare on Europe—make Russian gas flows ever less likely to resume.

## What do Texans care about most?

Texas’s Republican governor, [Greg Abbott](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/15/a-grassroots-group-is-channelling-public-frustration-in-texas), will face his Democratic rival, Beto O’Rourke, on Friday night. The debate in Edinburg, a border town in the south of Texas, is the only one in the Lone Star State before elections in November. The location, selected by Mr Abbott’s team, will allow him to highlight border security and [illegal immigration](https://te.arielherself.xyz/special-report/2019/06/20/immigration-shapes-the-politics-of-california-and-texas), which he has made central to his campaign.

Mr O’Rourke is trying to harness voters’ anger over Texas’s rightward shift on abortion and guns. Mr Abbott is betting that voters will care more about inflation and illegal immigration. He may be right: recent polls show him leading Mr O’Rourke by seven to eight points. The perception that the White House is not doing enough to [crack down on illegal immigration](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/05/22/the-title-42-furore-highlights-americas-broken-immigration-system) has pushed more Hispanic voters into the arms of the Republicans. Democratic hopes of demographic change turning Texas blue for now appear miscalculated.

## A portrait of environmental destruction

Over the past 20 years the Brazilian Amazon has lost 350,000 square kilometres to deforestation. This tragedy is the subject of “Broken Spectre”, a piece of video art by Richard Mosse, an Irish photographer. It opens at the National Gallery of Victoria in Australia on Friday, and at 180 The Strand, an exhibition space in London, on October 12th.

Through a combination of multi-spectral video, ultra-violet timelapses of the forest at night and black-and-white film, Mr Mosse reveals the war that ranchers, farmers, loggers and [<em>garimpeiros</em>](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/06/23/brazils-amazon-rainforest-has-become-more-dangerous) (wildcat miners) are waging on the rainforest. Over 74 minutes—the result of five years of work—the film shows trees felled and jungles set ablaze. The film’s visual effect is both dystopian and dreamlike; the scenes of destruction are also hauntingly beautiful. The intention is to “make people look again”, the artist explains. His work comes at a critical moment: in the run-up to the first round of Brazil’s [general election](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/09/08/jair-bolsonaro-is-poised-to-lose-the-brazilian-election) on Sunday, more fires, all man-made, were recorded in September than in any month in the past 12 years.
