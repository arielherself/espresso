<strong>Russia </strong>charged 92 members of <strong>Ukraine’s armed forces </strong>with crimes against humanity. Alexander Bastrykin, the head of Russia’s fearsome Investigative Committee, announced these as the first of many prosecutions to come. Ukraine has said it is looking into more than 21,000 [war crimes](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/04/04/how-if-at-all-might-russia-be-punished-for-its-war-crimes-in-ukraine) committed by Russian forces. Meanwhile President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country’s troops were advancing “step by step” towards [Kherson](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/03/ukraine-prepares-a-counter-offensive-to-retake-kherson-province) in southern Ukraine, which Russia seized early in the war. [Moldova’s](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/moldova-is-trying-to-stay-out-of-russias-war-with-ukraine/21809093) prime minister, Natalia Gavrilita, said she is “very worried” that her country could be invaded next, if Russia takes Odessa.

Visiting Cairo, Russia’s foreign minister, <strong>Sergei Lavrov</strong>, assured his Egyptian counterpart that his country would honour its commitment to allow <strong>the export of grain</strong> via the Black Sea to resume. Awkwardly, his ministry also confirmed that Russian cruise missiles had struck Odessa’s port the day after the deal was struck, casting doubt on the viability of its [promise to unblock grain stockpiled](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/22/after-agreeing-to-let-ukraine-export-grain-russia-rockets-its-port) in Ukraine. Last year Egypt bought four-fifths of its imported wheat from Russia and Ukraine. 

The <strong>Oak Fire</strong> near Yosemite National Park was “0% contained” on Sunday, according to California’s fire department, despite thousands of firefighters being deployed to tackle it. The state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, declared a state of emergency in the area. The [wildfire](https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2020/09/10/wildfires-will-be-more-common-in-a-warming-world) ignited on Friday and has so far set over 15,600 acres (6,313 hectares) of land ablaze.

Britain confirmed it would host the 2023 <strong>Eurovision Song Contest</strong>, instead of [this year’s winner](https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2022/04/25/singing-dancing-and-defending-their-country-meet-ukraines-eurovision-entry), Ukraine. Interested host cities include Manchester and Glasgow. Last month the European Broadcasting Union announced that Ukraine would not host Eurovision next year due to the ongoing war. Boris Johnson, Britain&#x27;s outgoing Prime Minister, tweeted that Britain would “put on a fantastic contest on behalf of our Ukrainian friends.”

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

Bavarian Nordic, a Danish biotechnology company, announced that the <strong>European Commission</strong> had approved its Imvanex <strong>vaccine</strong> for use against <strong>monkeypox</strong>. On Saturday the World Health Organisation declared the disease a global emergency. The Imvanex vaccine—developed for smallpox—has already been approved for monkeypox in America and Canada. Vaccination efforts are mainly focusing on men who have sex with men, [the group deemed to be most at risk](https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2022/07/23/monkeypox-is-declared-a-global-health-emergency). 

<strong>Myanmar’s</strong> junta executed four prisoners accused of “terror acts”, the state media reported on Monday. It is the first time in 30 years the country has enacted the death penalty. Two of the men were prominent democracy activists convicted of collaborating with a self-styled shadow government or its associated militias. The other two killed a woman they denounced as an informer for the junta.

The growth of <strong>China’s population</strong>, slowing for years, is now expected to go into decline sometime before 2025, according to a senior health official cited by the nationalistic <em>Global Times</em>. [Some observers](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2021/04/29/is-chinas-population-shrinking) think the peak has been passed already, but China’s government has denied it. Last year laws were changed to allow mothers to bear three children—to little avail.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 250m, the hoped-for viewership for this year’s women’s Euros competition—which would be up from 178m in 2017. [Read the full article](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/07/21/the-womens-euros-are-selling-out-stadiums).

## A criminal probe into Trumpworld

The House committee investigating Donald Trump’s interference in the 2020 election has laid a road map for federal prosecutors, who [could charge him with a crime](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/06/16/the-criminal-case-against-donald-trump) related to his conduct. But it is in Atlanta, Georgia, where the former president and his henchmen face the most immediate legal peril. Fani Willis, a local prosecutor, has been probing his efforts to overturn his loss in the state. She has subpoenaed dozens of witnesses, including Lindsey Graham, a US senator, and Rudy Giuliani, Mr Trump’s former lawyer. On Monday a grand jury will hear recorded testimony from Brian Kemp, the state’s governor.

Mr Trump notoriously ordered Georgia’s top election official to “find” enough votes to reverse his defeat. Soliciting election fraud is a crime in the state; legal experts reckon that demand puts him at risk of getting indicted. Ms Willis has already told the 16 “electors” who falsely cast the state’s electoral votes for Mr Trump that they are criminal targets. Asked whether she will subpoena Mr Trump, she stays evasive: “We’ll just have to see.”

## Tunisia’s president tears up the constitution

Democracy can end with a whimper—not a bang. On Monday Tunisians are voting on a [new constitution](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/07/21/tunisias-president-is-pushing-an-ominous-constitution). The charter would weaken parliament in favour of the president, giving him the right to hire and fire ministers and to impose an unlimited state of emergency. There would be no process for removing him. If approved, the constitution would consolidate a power grab by Kais Saied, the [authoritarian-minded president](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/tunisia-is-setting-itself-up-for-an-autocratic-future), who has ruled by decree since he suspended parliament last July.

Unlike the country’s 2014 constitution, drawn up in collaboration with the public in the wake of the Arab spring, which began in Tunisia, the new one—which Mr Saied claims will “correct” the course of the revolution—was written largely in secret. Voters have had less than a month to consider its contents. Mr Saied appointed Sadok Belaid, an accomplished law professor, to draft it, but Mr Belaid says the final text is quite different from what he submitted. He calls it “dangerous”. Opposition groups have urged Tunisians to boycott the referendum; turnout will probably be low (it was just 4.5% in the diaspora after two days of overseas voting). Eleven years after they [toppled a dictator](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2014/10/25/spring-is-still-in-the-air), many Tunisians have grown frustrated with impotent democratic leaders. But Mr Saied has little to offer except a return to the past.

## Ryanair’s soaring fortunes

European air travel has been [anything but smooth](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/07/travel-chaos-in-europe-is-a-glimpse-of-a-future-with-few-spare-workers) this summer. Staff shortages have led to long queues, giant piles of suitcases and angry passengers. But not everyone has been affected: Ryanair’s customers have been spared the worst of the chaos.

As Michael O’Leary, the airline’s boss, bragged on an earnings call on Monday, that is thanks to careful planning. Unlike other airlines, Ryanair did not lay off large numbers of staff when the pandemic began, thereby avoiding a last-minute race to rehire workers as travel demand rebounded. It also dodged soaring fuel prices by hedging its costs in advance. The airline reported a profit of $174m in the quarter ending in June, higher than analysts had predicted. 

But there may be turbulence ahead. Mr O’Leary warned that the recovery remains “fragile” and high oil prices will increase costs. And Ryanair is not completely immune from staffing woes: on Monday workers in Spain will walk out, demanding better working conditions.

## The rise and rise of franchise cricket

When the International Cricket Council, the sport’s governing body, sets out the next year’s playing calendar at its annual general meeting on Monday, the real insight lies not in when matches are being played—but when they aren’t.

As lucrative franchise leagues take off around the world, the ICC is increasingly prioritising domestic competitions over international test matches. In this year’s schedule, the [Indian Premier League](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/03/26/how-the-ipl-reflects-indias-strengths-and-weaknesses)—the most valuable competition in cricket—is expected to get an official two-and-a-half-month window where almost no international cricket will be played. That will allow the league to attract more players.

Other, less profitable, leagues will not get quite the same concessions. But the ICC is poised to give England and Australia breaks from international games during their own tournaments, so local players can compete. But while the proliferation of cricket may entertain fans, it risks burning out players. Last week Ben Stokes, England’s 31-year-old test captain, retired from one-day-international cricket; his body, he said, was “letting him down”.

## Politics in the Philippines: a generation game

In Manila on Monday the newly-elected president of the Philippines, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, gave his first annual address to Congress. Mr Marcos confidently spelt out a populist but generally plausible programme of government, full of detail on policy. Such detail had been glaringly absent from his [election campaign](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/06/29/by-electing-another-marcos-filipinos-show-they-have-forgotten-history), when vague slogans were enough to persuade voters that he would forgo the killing and thieving characteristic of the dictatorial regime of his late father, the first President Ferdinand Marcos, who was deposed by a popular uprising in 1986.

The younger Marcos has a strong incentive to put into action a sensible, democratic programme as it would justify the political rehabilitation of his dynasty. That would in turn improve the career prospects of the new president’s own eldest son, Ferdinand Alexander “Sandro” Marcos, a newly elected congressman—who was among the audience listening to his father’s address.
