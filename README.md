<strong>Ukraine </strong>continued to reckon with the fallout from Russia’s air strikes on its energy infrastructure, with much of the country still struggling with [blackouts](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/23/in-ukraine-living-as-normal-is-an-act-of-defiance). Residents in Kyiv, the capital, were told to prepare for more attacks. Russian missiles damaged a hospital on the outskirts of <strong>Zaporizhia</strong>, a Ukrainian-held city not far from Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, controlled by Russia. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said Russia was heavily shelling <strong>Kherson</strong>, the southern city recaptured by Ukrainian forces in early November. Local officials said that strikes killed seven people in the city on Thursday.

<strong>Covid-19</strong> infections in <strong>China</strong> recorded a new daily high of over 30,000, dashing hopes of a swift release from swingeing [social-distancing measures](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/11/24/chinas-response-to-a-surge-in-covid-19-cases-is-muddled). New cases were detected across the country, including in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, which is fighting a particularly acute outbreak. Shares in Asian stockmarkets sank along with [optimism](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/09/financial-markets-bet-on-an-end-to-chinas-zero-covid-policy) about China’s unshackling its economy any time soon.

<strong>Israel’s</strong> incoming prime minister, [Binyamin Netanyahu](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/04/bibi-is-back-and-israel-faces-a-dilemma-over-democracy), moved towards forming a government as his Likud party signed its first coalition deal with the far-right <strong>Jewish Power</strong> party. The initial pact, which does not finalise the full coalition, will see JP’s leader, [Itamar Ben-Gvir](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/11/03/who-is-itamar-ben-gvir-israels-kingmaker), become police minister and join the country’s security cabinet. The new government looks set to be the most right-wing in Israel’s history. 

<strong>Germany’s</strong> economy grew more than anticipated in the third quarter, as falling gas prices [seemingly](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/10/13/europe-is-growing-complacent-about-its-energy-crisis) staved off concerns about an energy crisis. GDP rose 0.4% from July to September, according to figures from Destatis, the federal statistics agency, exceeding earlier predictions of 0.3% growth. But the economic climate remains challenging, with a recession still expected and a [cold winter ahead](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/24/europe-faces-an-enduring-crisis-of-energy-and-geopolitics).

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Peru’s</strong> president, Pedro Castillo, accepted the resignation of Aníbal Torres, his prime minister and ally, as a stand-off with the country’s Congress continues. (Mr Torres quit after failing to get a confidence vote off the ground.) Opposition parliamentarians have twice impeached Mr Castillo without removing him from power. The leftist leader must now appoint [his fifth prime minister](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/09/29/peru-has-an-incompetent-president-and-a-discredited-congress) since taking office in July 2021.

Regulators in China said that <strong>Tesla </strong>is recalling more than 80,000 vehicles in the country because of problems affecting their seatbelts and battery software. The affected [vehicles](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/13/chinese-marques-try-to-make-inroads-into-western-markets) were imported to China between 2013 to 2020, according to the authorities. <strong>China </strong>is increasingly important to the American electric car manufacturer; its revenues in the country doubled last year to nearly $14bn.

<strong>Football World Cup:</strong> Iran’s football team sang the national anthem before their match against Wales. The team chose not to do so at their previous fixture in defiance against their government’s ongoing [brutal crackdown on protests](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/24/while-irans-turmoil-persists-jitters-spread-through-the-region). The players went on to dramatically win the match with two goals in its final minutes. Meanwhile, Senegal, African champions, easily beat Qatar, the hosts.

## Businesses brace for a bad Black Friday

Black Friday, when retailers around the world offer a dizzying array of discounts, usually marks the beginning of a merry season of frenzied consumerism. This year may be different. In October retail sales in America were higher than expected, but sales of electronics and various other discretionary goods continued to fall as consumers’ wallets were squeezed by inflation. That may spell trouble for businesses banking on an orgy of overindulgence.

To lure customers, American retailers have introduced deeper [Black Friday](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2020/11/26/black-friday-isnt-what-it-used-to-be) discounts than in previous years. But even after these deals, inflation still makes many products more expensive than last year’s shopping season. And because their bank accounts are no longer bulked up by savings made during the early months of the pandemic, shoppers have less to splurge.

The football World Cup may squeeze sales further. With America and England playing each other on Friday, consumers have yet another reason to steer clear of the crowds of bargain-hunters.

## Hong Kong’s Catholics under threat

On Friday Cardinal Joseph Zen, a former Bishop of Hong Kong, was found guilty of failing to register a fund to help pro-democracy protesters. Unlike many of the people he helped—more than 1,000 have been sentenced to prison—the 90-year-old will only be fined $HK4,000 ($512). Cardinal Zen’s hopes for democracy in Hong Kong, shared by many of the territory’s Catholics, were [crushed](https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/essay/2022/07/01/how-hong-kong-became-a-police-state) by China’s Communist Party. Now the party is going after their faith, too.

On the mainland China’s regime increasingly exerts control over Catholic churches, in part by pressuring them to register with the government. Clergy at registered churches must impart Communist Party doctrine to parishioners. A secret deal signed in 2018 by China and the Vatican is thought to give the party authority to nominate bishops.

The [“sinicisation”](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/11/22/china-wants-to-sinicise-its-catholics) of Catholicism has now reached Hong Kong. Catholic missionaries in the city say that mainland-style control is coming. One priest from Hong Kong says that churches there will remain open, but only cowed believers will worship in them.

## Bangladesh fires up a new coal plant

On Friday a new coal-fired power station will begin operating in southern Bangladesh. The project sits 14km from the Sundarbans, the world’s largest mangrove forest and a UNESCO heritage site. The plant, which cost $2bn to build, will burn 5m tonnes of coal each year. Bangladesh’s government hailed it as a symbol of co-operation with neighbouring India, the project’s main financier. But the plant is controversial: environmentalists opposed it and demanded that private banks not fund it, partly because of the threat it poses to the forest.

Bangladesh’s energy policy is cleaner than this fiasco suggests. Last year the government scrapped plans to construct ten coal-fired power stations after pressure from activists and trouble getting the necessary investments. It has instead focused largely on building natural-gas and nuclear plants. But domestic gas reserves are declining and imports are expensive. Regular blackouts—last month more than 100m people were plunged into darkness—may also slow Bangladesh’s transition away from the [world’s dirtiest fuel](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/10/13/how-to-get-asia-to-net-zero).

## Rebels without a pause

The east of Congo is home to one of the world’s forgotten wars. Or, rather, to many forgotten wars. More than 100 militias operate in the region, mostly local groups fighting for land and commodities. But one, M23, is more disruptive than others—over the past year it has seized towns and killed dozens of people. Congo and the UN reckon the group is backed by Rwanda, and that its attacks are part of a broader contest for power in the Great Lakes, a region of 100m people across [Congo](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/30/the-world-should-not-ignore-the-horrors-of-eastern-congo), Rwanda and Uganda. 

On Wednesday regional leaders meeting in Angola gave M23 an ultimatum: if a ceasefire is not in place in eastern Congo by 6pm local time on Friday, then Kenyan-led troops may force M23 to lay down arms. Even Rwanda’s foreign minister signed the statement calling for peace. But M23 argues that it was not party to the talks and will not withdraw. Congolese—who have endured more than three decades of violence—are right to worry about what comes next.

## Another outing for Lady Chatterley’s Lover

In “Lady Chatterley’s Lover” the heroine wishes for men to “leave [her] alone”. Film-makers seem unwilling to do the same to D.H. Lawrence’s final novel, first published in 1928 (obscenity laws meant that uncensored copies weren’t sold in America and Britain for another 30 years). The book—detailing the affair of an aristocrat and her gamekeeper—has been repeatedly adapted in the decades since.

The latest version, made for Netflix, is released in cinemas in America and Britain on Friday and will be available on the streaming service in December. Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre, the film’s French director, is not the first to apply a feminist lens to the story. In 2006 Pascale Ferran, another French director, was lauded for focusing on Lady Chatterley’s perspective (writers including Simone de Beauvoir had previously taken Lawrence to task for his patriarchal pomposity). Ms Clermont-Tonnerre’s take also focuses on the environment, championing the natural world that “mechanised greed” has ruined. What was once seen as simply blue is cast in a more modern shade of green.
