The [toll taken](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/05/26/how-xi-jinping-is-damaging-chinas-economy) on **China’s economy** by its pandemic lockdowns was apparent in data released on Friday, showing a sharp contraction in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the previous quarter. GDP fell by 2.6% from the previous three months, with annual growth slowing to just 0.4%, well below analysts’ expectations. Although many covid-19 restrictions have been eased, China’s zero-covid policy makes a rapid recovery unlikely.

Demonstrators in Colombo have been celebrating the end of **Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s** presidency of **Sri Lanka** . Mr Rajapaksa [fled the country](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/13/sri-lankas-president-flees-leaving-the-country-in-chaos) this week amid economic collapse and mass protests and is now in Singapore. On Friday the speaker announced that his resignation had been accepted, and that Ranil Wickremesinghe, the prime minister, will continue as acting president until a vote is held in parliament, which will convene on July 16th.

Italy’s president [rejected an offer](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/14/mario-draghi-italys-prime-minister-tries-and-fails-to-resign) by **Mario Draghi** to resign as prime minister after losing the support of one of his coalition allies, the Five Star Movement. A former head of the European Central Bank, Mr Draghi has held the office since February 2021, helping to stabilise Italian politics. The president’s decision means he will have to try again to win the backing of his coalition, or form a new one.

 **Rishi Sunak** topped a second successive round of voting among **Conservative Party** MPs in the contest to succeed Boris Johnson as party leader and [Britain’s prime minister](https://www.economist.com/interactive/2022/07/12/the-race-to-become-britains-next-pm). **Penny Mordaunt** , a trade minister, also made another strong showing. Suella Braverman, the attorney-general, was knocked out of the contest after coming in last. She threw her support behind Liz Truss, the current foreign secretary.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

 **Russian** missiles struck the city of Vinnytsia in central **Ukraine** on Thursday, killing at least 23 people, including three children, according to Ukrainian officials. Another 66 people were wounded. The strikes were launched from a Russian submarine in the Black Sea, officials said. Meanwhile, more than 40 countries pledged to work together to investigate alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine.

 **America’s** president, [Joe Biden](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/07/12/what-does-the-middle-east-offer-america), and **Israel’s** prime minister, [Yair Lapid](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/07/07/israels-new-leader-yair-lapid-has-four-months-to-prove-himself), signed a joint pledge to prevent **Iran** from obtaining nuclear arms. America declared itself “prepared to use all elements of its national power” to stop Iran developing the weapons, implying military force as a last resort. The Iranian government said any “mistake” made by its enemies would be met with a “harsh and regrettable response”.

Christopher Waller, a governor of **the Federal Reserve** , indicated that America’s central bank is mulling a whole-percentage-point bump to its benchmark interest rate. Mr Waller said he favours the move instead of another increase of 75 basis points, as was ordered in June. This week’s [high-inflation readings](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/07/13/american-inflation-tops-forecasts-yet-again-adding-to-recession-risks) startled the Fed and its watchers, and may provoke a drastic decision when it meets later this month.

 **Fact of the day:** 84km, the range of the High-Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems that America has sent to Ukraine. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/13/ukraines-new-rockets-are-wreaking-havoc-on-russias-army).

## Earnings season for American banks

Monetary policy is supposed to take time to work its magic. But central bankers’ abrupt shift to fight inflation seriously has caused financial conditions in America to tighten sharply in 2022. Just how brutal the shift has been was exposed on Thursday when JPMorgan Chase, the country’s largest bank, and Morgan Stanley, released results showing that for both banks net income fell by around 30% in the second quarter of the year.  


Sharper than expected falls in investment banking revenues pulled down overall results. As stocks have slumped and interest rates have climbed, firms have all but stopped merging, issuing debt or going public. At Morgan Stanley revenue from investment banking fell 55%.  
  
 Revenues earned by their colleagues on the trading floor, where market volatility tends to lift trading activity and revenues, were up by around 15% at both firms. And in JPMorgan&#x27;s retail bank strong loan growth helped lift interest income. Still, those tailwinds were not quite able to offset the precipitous turn in fortunes for Wall Street’s slick investment bankers.

## The end of the chipmaking boom

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which makes 90% of the world’s chips with the smallest, most efficient circuits, reported stronger than anticipated quarterly results on Thursday. It announced net income of NT$237bn ($7.9bn), almost NT$20bn above the average prediction. Nonetheless, [tougher times are ahead](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/10/after-a-turbocharged-boom-are-chipmakers-in-for-a-supersized-bust).

One problem is [supply](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/01/29/when-will-the-semiconductor-cycle-peak). Laptops and smartphones, which use half of all chips produced, sold strongly during covid-19 lockdowns. Investment in production boomed. But much of the new capacity will come on later this year, when demand is expected to drop.

Another worry is geopolitics. Policymakers want to move chip manufacturing supply chains within their own borders. Such fragmentation would drive up costs and leave chip firms beholden to local politics. Another chip giant, Intel, has threatened to postpone the launch of two American factories because of a delay by Congress in passing a subsidies bill worth $52bn over five years to American chipmakers. A soaring TSMC may be about to fall back down to earth.

## Italy’s government on the brink

After days of wobbling, Italy’s coalition government looked about to collapse on Thursday when the prime minister, Mario Draghi, [offered to resign](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/14/mario-draghi-italys-prime-minister-tries-and-fails-to-resign). Earlier he won a vote of no-confidence, but this was boycotted by the populist Five Star Movement (M5S), whose leader, Giuseppe Conte, was dissatisfied with measures to offset the effects of the energy crisis. Mr Conte suggested M5S could anyway remain part of the governing coalition, but then Mr Draghi vowed to resign if the Movement withdrew its support. On Thursday evening he announced that he was doing just that—only for Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, to reject his resignation.

The stability of the coalition matters. Investors are fretting over Italy’s public debt, which has reached more than 150% of GDP. The departure of Mr Draghi, a former head of the European Central Bank, will further add to the woes of the beleaguered euro.

## Bastille Day in France

The French on Thursday celebrate Bastille Day, their national holiday and a commemoration of the storming of the Bastille prison in Paris in 1789. It is a yearly show of national pride and local festivities, with a military parade and fly-past in Paris. This year, against the backdrop of war in Ukraine, troops from eastern Europe have also been invited to take part.

Behind the patriotic flag-waving, however, the national mood is uncertain. President Emmanuel Macron was re-elected in April, but [lost his parliamentary majority](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/06/12/frances-legislative-election-puts-emmanuel-macrons-majority-in-doubt) in June. He now runs a [minority government](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/07/frances-president-emmanuel-macron-decides-to-go-it-alone), under Elisabeth Borne, his prime minister, and faces a hostile and noisy opposition. In the short run, things may go deceptively quiet as the French depart for their long summer break. But with inflation rising and worries about energy costs, <em>la rentrée</em> in September is likely to bring discontent, in parliament and on the streets.

## Fashion’s dirty secrets

Bosses at Victoria’s Secret, a struggling American lingerie brand, will be hoping “Victoria’s Secret: Angels and Demons” draws a line under the sins of their predecessors. The three-part documentary is released on Thursday on Hulu. It focuses on the rise and fall of the brand, as well as the close personal relationship between Leslie Wexner, the former chief executive of its parent company, L Brands, and Jeffrey Epstein, his financier until 2007, who died in prison in 2019 awaiting a sentence for sex-trafficking minors. The film looks at the decades-long personal and business ties between the pair, and an alleged sexual assault by Epstein in a house he owned within Mr Wexner’s sprawling Ohio estate. Mr Wexner has denied any knowledge of Epstein’s alleged crimes. 

The documentary is part of a wave of fashion retrospectives portraying an industry in trouble. “Scouting for Girls: Fashion’s Darkest Secret” charts endemic abuse of women in modelling. And “White Hot: The Rise &amp; Fall of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch” takes aim at another former-Wexner fashion brand. Despite energetic efforts by both Victoria’s Secret and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch to reinvent themselves in recent years, these films could turn ever more shoppers away.
