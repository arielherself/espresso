Anderson Torres, who was <strong>Brazil’s </strong>justice minister under Jair Bolsonaro, the former president, was arrested in Brasília, the capital, on his return from Florida. Mr Torres was responsible for security in the city on January 8th when supporters of Mr Bolsonaro [stormed government buildings](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2023/01/12/a-copycat-insurrection-in-brazil-and-its-troubling-aftermath). He is accused of colluding with the rioters (which he denies). Earlier Brazil’s Supreme Court agreed to prosecutors’ request that Mr Bolsonaro be included as a subject of their investigation.

A second wave of Russian missile attacks, the first in a fortnight, hit Ukraine. Strikes were reported in Kyiv, and the regions of Kharkiv and Lviv. Meanwhile Rishi Sunak, <strong>Britain’s </strong>prime minister, said that his country would send Challenger 2 <strong>tanks </strong>to Ukraine. On Wednesday, Poland promised German-made Leopard 2 [battle tanks](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/01/11/the-west-should-supply-tanks-to-ukraine). America, France and Germany have said they will send [lighter fighting vehicles](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2023/01/05/what-is-a-tank-and-does-frances-gift-to-ukraine-fit-the-bill): Bradleys, AMX and Marders respectively. 

<strong>China </strong>said that 60,000 people died of <strong>covid-19</strong> in the country in the past five weeks, since it [abandoned its “zero-covid” policy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2023/01/10/covid-is-complicating-chinas-efforts-to-re-engage-with-the-world). The figures only covered deaths in hospitals, and the true figure is probably higher. Until Saturday the authorities had announced only several dozen covid deaths. The government claims that the peak of infections has passed.

Meanwhile <strong>China</strong> appointed Zheng Yanxiong, the former head of <strong>Hong Kong’s</strong> security forces, to lead the government’s liaison office in the city. He is the mainland’s most senior representative there. Mr Zheng, who led the security agency after it was established in 2020, oversaw a crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong following the passage of a draconian national-security law in June of that year.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

A <strong>Polish </strong>scientist imprisoned in <strong>Iran </strong>was released and returned home. Maciej Walczak was detained with several other foreign nationals in September 2021. They were accused of offences that included taking soil samples in restricted locations. Separately Iran executed a British-Iranian dual national, Alireza Akbari, who served as Iran’s deputy defence minister from 2000-08. He was arrested in 2019 and convicted of espionage.

<strong>Czechs </strong>cast ballots on the second and final day of voting in their presidential election. Andrej Babis, a billionaire and populist, leads the field. Mr Babis, who was prime minister between 2017 and 2021, was acquitted of fraud this week. If no candidate wins more than half the vote, the top two will face a run off for the largely ceremonial position in a fortnight.

<strong>America’s</strong> Treasury secretary warned that the government will be unable to service its <strong>debt</strong> by June unless Congress raises the statutory <strong>borrowing limit</strong>. Janet Yellen said that, starting on Thursday, the government will have to start repurposing funds to pay its bills. Raising the [debt ceiling](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2021/09/25/americas-debt-ceiling-is-a-disaster-though-fiscal-rules-can-help) from $31.4trn is needed to avoid a sovereign default. With Republican fiscal hawks [newly empowered in Congress](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2023/01/09/what-is-the-house-freedom-caucus), brinkmanship awaits.

<strong>Word of the week:</strong> <em>narcocorrido</em>, Spanish for “drug ballad”, these are songs about crime bosses and their activities, and are performed by some of Mexico’s most popular bands.

## America and Taiwan talk trade

On Saturday American officials will make a rare visit to Taiwan to resume talks on trade. In some ways, this is a trade negotiation like any other. The Americans, led by Terry McCartin, an assistant trade representative, will raise familiar concerns about Taiwan’s import barriers (especially against pork and beef), labour standards and state-owned enterprises. But the geopolitical context is unique. 

Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade province, is feeling diplomatically isolated. It is not a member of either of the big trade agreements in the region, [RCEP](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2020/11/15/the-meaning-of-rcep-the-worlds-biggest-trade-agreement) (which includes China) and the [CPTPP](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/02/19/asias-premier-trade-pact-needs-stronger-foundations) (which does not). Nor was it included in America’s new [Indo-Pacific Economic Framework](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/06/09/what-is-the-point-of-the-indo-pacific-economic-framework), which aims to increase America’s commercial appeal in a part of the world falling under China’s economic spell. Taiwan thus welcomes the negotiations as a sign of America’s commitment to the island. Trade negotiations can be bruising. But Taiwan will prefer tough talks to silence.

## Germany weans itself off Russian gas

On Saturday Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, and Robert Habeck, the economy minister, will travel to Lubmin on the Baltic coast to open the country’s second floating terminal for [liquefied natural gas](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/02/26/if-the-supply-of-russian-gas-to-europe-were-cut-off-could-lng-plug-the-gap) (LNG). It is another milestone in the country’s effort to reduce its consumption of Russian gas. 

Until the end of last year Germany had no infrastructure to import LNG. Its other terminal opened on the North Sea coast in December. A third will soon open there too. By the end of this year Germany will have inaugurated half a dozen, providing enough import capacity to cover a third of Germany’s total gas needs. To build LNG terminals at such speed has cost the taxpayer billions of euros, but it will help ensure Germany can [get through the next winter](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2023/01/11/the-energy-crisis-and-europes-astonishing-luck) without gas shortages.

## “Big Brother” returns to Africa

One of the world’s best-known reality television shows returns to Africa’s screens on Sunday with a special edition called “Big Brother Titans”. Contestants from the rival continental powers of Nigeria and South Africa will be pitted against each other for the first time. And there’s $100,000 on the line.

Spin-offs of the TV franchise have been a huge success in Africa since it first aired there in 2003. Initially there was “Big Brother Africa”. DStv, a broadcaster, has often hosted channels carrying nothing but 24/7 live-streams of the houses where contestants live together and try to avoid being voted out. (The last one standing takes the cash.) Showmax, which streams DStv’s content, reported in 2020 that Big Brother Naija (Nigeria), a national version, was its most-watched livestream ever. Nigerians made up only half its viewership. As the continent-wide edition returns, there is hope that its mix of scandal, romance and high drama will again have pan-African appeal. 

## Boiled peanuts used to treat allergies

Between 1 and 3% of people in most countries must scrupulously avoid peanuts or risk anaphylactic shock. And the allergy’s prevalence has [tripled in the past two decades](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2019/10/03/the-prevalence-of-peanut-allergy-has-trebled-in-15-years) in America. To help sufferers, researchers have been experimenting with exposure therapy using boiled peanuts, which washes out some of their immunoreactive proteins. (This may be why peanut allergies are less prevalent in East Asia, where people usually boil their peanuts). The latest results, published in the journal<em> Clinical &amp; Experimental Allergy</em>, are promising.

In the trial, 70 children with a peanut allergy underwent a year-long peanut training regimen. They began by eating some peanut boiled for 12 hours and escalating the dose every week. Eventually, they could nibble peanuts boiled for only two hours, and after a year most could scoff 12 roasted peanuts at a time. A slow process, but surely worth it to spare people the EpiPen or a trip to hospital. For these children at least, the label “may contain nuts” is no longer tantamount to a skull and crossbones.

## Weekend profile: J.R. Moehringer, prince of ghostwriters

As John Joseph (known as J.R.) Moehringer put it himself, “the midwife doesn’t go home with the baby”. Such is the lot of ghostwriters. You might expect Mr Moehringer to observe his own rule with extra rigour after he midwifed Prince Harry’s [todger-and-all memoir](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2023/01/10/prince-harrys-autobiography-is-an-ill-advised-romp), “Spare”. Yet the furore surrounding the book has prompted Mr Moehringer to bend it, mainly by defending several inaccuracies on Twitter. Perhaps that’s because “Spare” is just as much Mr Moehringer’s work as Harry’s. From chimps to champs to princes, Mr Moehringer can find a written voice for anyone, especially if they have daddy issues (and a very large advance).

Mr Moehringer, born in 1964 in New York City, started work as a journalist at the <em>New York Times</em>. He once inhabited the voice of Cheeta, the chimp star of the 1930s Tarzan films, to write a piece marking his 75th birthday. But Mr Moehringer’s own memoir, “The Tender Bar”, published in 2005, established his real theme: how to survive dysfunctional families. Mr Moehringer writes of his absent, “brutally insensitive” father, a rock’n’roll DJ. For male role models he had to make do with the alcohol-soaked camaraderie of uncle Charlie and his mates in a bar. 

The narrative of a lost boy striving to find his true self caught the eye of Andre Agassi, a tennis star of the 1990s with an outrageous mullet. He asked Mr Moehringer to help write his own memoir. Confronted, at first, by a “stilted, resistant” Mr Agassi, Mr Moehringer unlocked his subject, much as he must have done with Harry, with some 250 hours of interviews. The process bears a close resemblance to psychoanalysis. Harry calls Mr Moehringer his “confessor” in the acknowledgments to “Spare”. 

Mr Agassi’s book, “Open”, was revealing. It turned out that the Wimbledon winner hated tennis. Even the mullet was fake (to hide baldness). And, of course, there was the emotionally distant father. So, as the publishers must have realised, the Moehringer template was a perfect fit for Harry. 

But what suits publishers may not have best served the prince, who might have hoped to emerge with a bit more dignity. In an age of selfies and social-media exposure, however, dignity is not going to sell books. Prince Harry chose the right ghostwriter to do that.
