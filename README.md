<strong>China</strong> announced a plan to end mandatory quarantine for inbound travellers, beginning on January 8th, as part of an official downgrade of its level of response to the covid-19 pandemic. China’s president, <strong>Xi Jinping</strong>, earlier said that more targeted “patriotic health campaigns” are needed during the latest phase. The country’s [hospitals](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/12/15/our-model-shows-that-chinas-covid-death-toll-could-be-massive) are reportedly becoming overwhelmed after the abrupt ending of many restrictions.

<strong>Taiwan’s </strong>defence ministry said <strong>China </strong>sent 71 warplanes and seven naval vessels on “strike drills”⁠—rehearsals for conflict⁠—into its air-defence zone on Sunday. China had condemned an American spending bill that included military assistance for Taiwan, accusing both countries of escalating their “collusion and provocation”. Tensions have been especially high since Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of America’s House of Representatives, [visited the island](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/03/nancy-pelosi-has-left-taiwan-the-real-crisis-may-be-just-beginning) in August.

A<strong> Ukrainian</strong> <strong>drone</strong> attacked an airbase deep within <strong>Russia</strong>, reportedly killing three people. Although the drone was shot down, its debris proved fatal. The Engels base lies 500km from the Russia-Ukraine border and is used to launch missiles. Kremlin forces, meanwhile, fired 40 rockets at Ukrainian cities on Christmas Day, despite Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, saying he was ready to negotiate peace.

<strong>South Korea</strong> scrambled warplanes and fired warning shots after unmanned drones flown from <strong>North Korea</strong> “violated” its airspace. South Korea spotted the aerial vehicles crossing the[ “military demarcation line”](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2013/11/05/why-is-the-border-between-the-koreas-sometimes-called-the-38th-parallel) separating the two countries on Monday morning. The last time a [North Korean](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-reads/2022/10/18/what-to-read-to-understand-north-korea) drone was discovered in the South was in 2017 but 2022 has been a record year for missile testing by the North.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Toyota</strong> produced 833,104 vehicles in November, a record for the month, with global production at the Japanese carmaker 1.5% higher than in November last year. Although the supply-chain crunch of car parts caused by the pandemic has eased somewhat, the rising cost of materials, covid in China and a shortage of[ semiconductors](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/09/29/why-some-chipmakers-are-hurting-much-more-than-others) is still restraining production.

Electricity returned to most of the <strong>American homes </strong>plunged into blackouts by <strong>winter storms </strong>over the weekend: at its worst, 1.8m households were without power. Around 50 people have died during the storm. The harshest toll was counted in upstate New York, where at least 25 people were killed by extreme cold and [related disruptions](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/24/weather-is-again-determining-economic-outcomes) around Buffalo.

<strong>Iran’s </strong>Revolutionary Guards arrested seven people linked to [anti-government protests](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/04/irans-rattled-government-may-be-backing-down), including some British dual nationals who were trying to leave the country. Meanwhile, the country’s Supreme Court commuted the death sentence of Saman Seydi Yasin, a rapper, who had been convicted in a sham trial of attempting to kill security forces. Two protesters have been executed this month.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 78%, the share of French people who support the legalisation of assisted dying. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/12/20/france-starts-a-debate-on-legalising-assisted-dying).

## 2023 in preview: How might the war in Ukraine play out?

<em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will be shaping Europe?</em>

As 2022 draws to a close, Ukraine is still an independent state—something few may have predicted when [Russia invaded it](https://te.arielherself.xyz/ukraine-crisis) in February. Three broad scenarios now seem plausible for next year. The first, and worst, assumes that Russia stabilises the front lines and rebuilds its battalions. Supplies and arms from America and Europe could dwindle. Western countries might then lobby Ukraine to accept a ceasefire. 

The second, and far more likely, is a stalemate. Russia might mobilise enough young men to fill trenches and man fortifications, without training them to be the effective fighters needed for victory. Unwilling to concede, President Vladimir Putin might simply try to exhaust Ukraine and its allies. 

The third is the most encouraging, and possibly the most dangerous. Ukraine, maintaining its current momentum, could bring its forces to the cusp of Crimea. Mr Putin might then issue an ultimatum: stop or risk the use of nuclear weapons. The world will hold its breath.

## 2023 in preview: Inflation will be tough for Europe

<em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will be shaping Europe?</em>

In 2023 the full economic impact of price rises—and the energy crunch largely responsible for them—will be felt across Europe. A [recession](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/why-a-global-recession-is-inevitable-in-2023) is coming, followed by a painfully slow recovery. 

Though Europe added to its capacity to import liquefied natural gas after Russia slashed sales, global LNG supplies will not increase by much in 2023. That means energy will remain expensive, and it will keep prices high across the rest of the economy. Hard-hit consumers and businesses will start to hold back, curbing both spending and investment.

Europe’s shortage of workers will get worse, which will hurt firms but keep unemployment low. But unlike in previous slumps, the global economy will not come to Europe’s rescue: it is currently suffering much the same malaise. Only once energy prices have fallen and inflation in America has been contained will global growth be able to support Europe’s recovery. That will come, but not in 2023.

## 2023 in preview: Britons expect more civil disorder

<em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will be shaping Europe?</em>

Barring sectarian scuffles in Northern Ireland, Britain has experienced relatively little civil disorder in the past ten years. That peaceful run will probably end in 2023—though not necessarily for the most obvious reason.

The soaring cost of energy and food [seems dangerous](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/06/23/a-wave-of-unrest-is-coming-heres-how-to-avert-some-of-it), but bad behaviour does not always follow bad economic times. People are more likely to riot because they feel the authorities are behaving intolerably, and because they think they can get away with it. Both conditions now apply in Blighty. 

In London, the epicentre of most British disorder, attitudes to the police have deteriorated in recent years: in March 2022 57% of Londoners described the force as reliable, compared with 77% in 2014. A string of crimes, including the murder of Sarah Everard by a police officer in 2021, surely contributed, as did a sharp increase in the number of people stopped and searched. And as memories fade of riots in decades past, so too may fears of the baleful consequences of fresh disorder.

## 2023 in preview: Can Europe’s anti-Putin alliance hold?

<em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will be shaping Europe?</em>

The remarkable unity shown by European governments in 2022—in response to President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine—will probably be tested in 2023. The longer the war continues, the more likely it is that some in Europe will call for a negotiated peace. Some may yearn for a resumption of Russian gas exports; others might fear that Europe will have to shoulder more of the burden if America’s support for Ukraine declines after its presidential election in 2024. 

Although these voices are not expected to prevail, they will cause discord and tension. Italy’s economic woes could lead to a weakening of the support for Ukraine that Giorgia Meloni, the [new prime minister](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/22/giorgia-meloni-and-her-allies-take-power-in-italy), currently espouses. And as more countries slip into recession, the leaders of the poorest may become more amenable to the idea of negotiation—and increasingly bitter towards their wealthier neighbours, which can more easily weather the storm.
