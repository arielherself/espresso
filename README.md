<strong>Taiwan</strong> accused <strong>China</strong> of conducting exercises simulating an invasion of the island on the third day of its most-provocative military drills in decades. China had previously [fired missiles](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/08/04/china-sends-missiles-flying-over-taiwan) over Taipei, the island’s capital, and sent warships across the Taiwan Strait’s median line. Talks with America on several topics were halted following the [visit](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/03/nancy-pelosi-has-left-taiwan-the-real-crisis-may-be-just-beginning) of Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of America’s House of Representatives, to Taiwan on Tuesday.

<strong>Indiana</strong> became the first state to pass a law restricting <strong>abortion</strong> since the Supreme Court rescinded Americans’ [constitutional right to the practice](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/06/26/the-fallout-from-overturning-roe) in June. The near-total ban will allow termination only in cases of rape or incest, to protect the mother’s health or if the fetus has a fatal abnormality. It will go into effect from September 15th.

Oksana Pokalchuk, the head of the <strong>Ukrainian </strong>branch of <strong>Amnesty International</strong>, quit, citing differences with the human-rights organisation’s leadership. On Thursday Amnesty accused Ukraine’s armed forces of endangering civilians by stationing troops in residential areas (officials say they evacuate civilians from areas with fighting). President Volodomyr Zelensky warned that Amnesty’s claims would fuel Russian propaganda. Ms Pokalchuk said she had tried unsuccessfully to encourage the group to amend its position.

<strong>America’s </strong>job growth was unexpectedly strong in July, according to [figures](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/05/americas-jobs-boom-rolls-on-fuelling-fears-of-sustained-inflation) from the Labour department. Employers added 528,000 jobs, taking the level of employment above its pre-pandemic level and assuaging fears that the economy was falling into a recession. The news could give the Federal Reserve more reason to raise interest rates further in its campaign to slow inflation.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Israeli</strong> air strikes on the <strong>Gaza Strip</strong> continued in the early hours of Saturday morning, while militants fired rockets towards Israel in response. An Israeli attack hours earlier had reportedly killed at least ten people, including a commander of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militant group, and a young girl. The fighting followed rising tension after the arrest of a PIJ member in the occupied West Bank.

Health officials in <strong>Britain </strong>said there were early signs that the spread of <strong>monkeypox </strong>was slowing. The country has some 2,900 confirmed cases of the virus, which is similar to smallpox but less fatal. The announcement comes a day after America declared its own monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency, following a [similar move](https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2022/07/23/monkeypox-is-declared-a-global-health-emergency) by the World Health Organisation.

A jury in <strong>Texas </strong>[decided](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/08/05/the-alex-jones-defamation-case-was-less-about-the-money-than-the-truth) that Alex Jones, a conspiracy theorist, must pay $45.2m in punitive damages to the parents of a six-year-old boy killed in the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012. Mr Jones had already been ordered to pay $4.1m in compensatory damages to the plaintiffs, for having pressed the idea that the tragedy was a hoax and that the parents and children were “crisis actors”. He faces several more trials next month, including one in Connecticut, where the shooting occurred.

Word of the week: <em>Ganbei</em>, a Chinese term meaning “drink up”. The word is often used when people try to bring up life under China’s covid-19 lockdowns, according to one psychologist.

## Republican sentiment grows in Jamaica

The former British colony’s celebration on Saturday of 60 years of independence will be bittersweet. Many Jamaicans had hoped that by now their country would not only be independent but might have also removed Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state.

Republican sentiment has been growing across the Caribbean (where nine of 13 sovereign island states were once ruled by Britain; other islands remain overseas dependencies). Last year Barbados [shed the British monarchy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2020/09/16/barbados-decides-to-dump-the-queen). Jamaica’s government has set out a plan to do the same by 2025. But removing the monarch requires the assent of two-thirds of lawmakers in the lower house and senate, and of citizens in a referendum. That is a tall order. And many Jamaicans see debates about the head of state as of little importance compared with improving the economy and reducing sky-high levels of violence. Addressing those may prove even harder.

## Twin Town, USA

In 1823 the Ohio settlement of Millsville was rechristened Twinsburg in honour of Moses and Aaron Wilcox, identical brothers who donated land and money to the town on the condition it was named after them. In 1976 the town invited twins to visit, capitalising on the name. Now a three-day festival, held this weekend, Twins Days is the largest gathering of the multiple-birthed in the world.

Although the festivities are aimed towards twins, triplets and quads, singletons are welcome too. One highlight is the Double Take Parade—this year’s theme is “Welcome 2 the jungle”, so expect rainforest creatures coming two by two. Twins make great [lab rats](https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2004/08/12/two-of-a-kind), too. So amid the look-alike contests, siblings in Twinsburg undergo scientific testing. Identical pairs are used to examine the relationship between [genes and environment](https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2004/08/12/claiming-ones-inheritance). One study will look at whether taste is genetically determined. Another takes biometric samples to improve facial recognition technology—identity mix-ups being an issue many twins know only too well.

## Sino-American rivalry in the South Pacific

Eighty years after Allied forces landed in the Solomon Islands to confront Japan’s army, a senior American diplomat will visit the Oceanic country in a bid to combat expanding Chinese influence in the Pacific. This weekend Wendy Sherman, the deputy secretary of state, will commemorate the anniversary of the Battle of Guadalcanal and meet Solomon Islands officials, including the prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare.

Mr Sogovare alarmed America and its allies in April by [signing a security pact with China](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/04/02/china-makes-inroads-in-the-solomon-islands), allowing it to send security forces and naval ships to the Solomons. Critics fear that could lead to a Chinese military base. China and the Solomon Islands say they have no such plans, but America and its regional allies, especially Australia, have nonetheless promised more aid and engagement with Pacific Island nations. Ms Sherman’s delegation is also visiting Samoa, Tonga, Australia and New Zealand. At least her island-hopping shouldn’t rattle the Chinese as much as [Nancy Pelosi’s](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/03/nancy-pelosi-has-left-taiwan-the-real-crisis-may-be-just-beginning) did.

## “The Sandman” comes to Netflix

From 1988 to 1996 Neil Gaiman, a prolific author, immersed readers in an intricately plotted, supernatural universe. At its centre was Dream, also known as Morpheus or the Sandman, among other names, who controls all dreams. Attempts to turn [“The Sandman”](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/08/05/the-endless-magic-of-neil-gaimans-the-sandman) into a film or television series floundered for decades. On Friday Netflix released the first ten-episode season of its adaptation of the graphic novel.

The result is magnificent. The comic’s episodic structure makes it well suited to television. Netflix’s gargantuan investment—of a reported $15m per episode, exceeding even the estimated budget of “The Crown” ($13m)—ensures that it is an audiovisual extravaganza. Perhaps the money, like the wait, will have been worth it. Should “The Sandman” of 2022 find the same fervent fans as the original did, Netflix will have a wealth of material with which to make sequels and spin-offs.

## Weekend profile: Gustavo Petro, a former guerrilla and Colombia’s next president

Latin America is known for leftist revolutionaries, from Che Guevara to Hugo Chávez. Yet a leftist ruler was once unthinkable in Colombia. For 52 years the government was at war with a Marxist guerrilla movement called the [FARC](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/07/07/some-ex-farc-guerrillas-have-become-tourist-guides-in-colombia). By 2016, when the armed conflict ended, it had become the longest in the Western hemisphere. But on Sunday Gustavo Petro [assumes the presidency](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/06/20/how-gustavo-petro-a-former-guerrilla-might-govern-colombia) of Colombia.

As a 17-year-old Mr Petro joined the April 19th Movement, an urban guerrilla group known as the M-19. A low-level functionary, in 1985 he was in prison for allegedly storing weapons when the M-19 stormed Colombia’s Supreme Court. The arrival of the army resulted in a shootout, in which about half of the court’s judges were killed in crossfire, along with nearly 100 other people (Mr Petro appears to have had no involvement in the event).

After M-19 demobilised in 1990, Mr Petro entered politics. He became famous as a congressman for exposing links between politicians and right-wing paramilitary groups, and for calling out corruption. But he was less successful as mayor of Bogotá, Colombia’s capital, a job he held from 2012 to 2015. Mr Petro developed a reputation as a dictatorial boss and was briefly suspended after mismanaging the municipal restructuring of a private rubbish-collection service.

Today Mr Petro still harbours some of his youthful idealism. He has promised to provide all unemployed Colombians—11% of the labour force—with a state job, and to make public higher education free. He wants to prohibit new licences for oil and gas exploration, though extractive industries make up around half of Colombia’s exports. Yet Mr Petro’s revolutionary spirit has been somewhat tempered. He picked José Antonio Ocampo, a moderate who is sceptical about offering state jobs to the unemployed, as his finance minister. Mr Ocampo will serve alongside several other centrist ministers.

And since the election in June Mr Petro has focused on building support among the established parties he once denounced. He has even met his arch-nemesis, Álvaro Uribe, a powerful right-wing former president. Most of Colombia’s big parties have promised to back Mr Petro. That may give him the parliamentary majority he needs to pass reforms, including a tax bill that will be his first major test in government. The rebel has become the peacemaker.
