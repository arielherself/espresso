<strong>Mikhail Gorbachev</strong>, aged 91, [died at hospital in Moscow](https://te.arielherself.xyz/obituary/2022/08/30/mikhail-gorbachev-has-died), according to Russian news reports. As leader of the Soviet Union he launched a set of policies known as <em>glasnost </em>and <em>perestroika</em>, aimed at opening the economy and democratising politics. Mr Gorbachev [cultivated warmer relations with the West](https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2017/08/31/how-mikhail-gorbachev-ended-the-cold-war) and supported communist reformers in central and eastern Europe. He won the Nobel peace prize in 1990, and remained president of the Soviet Union until its collapse in 1991.

<strong>Ukraine</strong> claimed to have destroyed bridges across the Dnipro river and ammunition depots in its [counter-offensive](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/29/ukraine-starts-a-push-to-recapture-kherson-a-crucial-russian-occupied-city) in the Russian-occupied region of <strong>Kherson</strong>. Meanwhile, UN inspectors arrived in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, intending to visit the [Zaporizhia nuclear plant](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/08/19/what-is-at-stake-at-ukraines-zaporizhia-nuclear-plant), though Ukrainian officials accused Russia of trying to sabotage the mission. At a meeting in Prague, European Union defence ministers considered a proposal to train Ukrainian troops, which America, Britain and several EU countries are [already doing](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/25/ukraine-and-russia-both-need-more-soldiers).

The UN appealed for $160m in aid to help victims of <strong>Pakistan’s floods</strong>, which have now submerged a [third of the country](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/30/pakistan-has-been-hit-by-its-worst-floods-in-recent-memory). The death toll has risen to more than 1,100 people. The planning minister estimated at least $10bn in damages and warned of food shortages. Separately the IMF approved a bail-out of $1.1bn to help Pakistan avoid defaulting on its debts.

The <strong>Chinese Communist Party’s</strong> leadership congress will start on October 16th, according to state media. [Xi Jinping](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/07/13/xi-jinping-has-nurtured-an-ugly-form-of-chinese-nationalism) is likely to secure an unprecedented third term as party leader. The week-long event will review the country’s sweeping education and technology reforms, and will be closely watched for signals that China’s draconian zero-covid strategy has run its course.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Elon Musk</strong> argued in a court filing that allegations of lax security at <strong>Twitter</strong>, made recently by its former security chief, bolstered his case to withdraw [his bid](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/07/11/with-or-without-elon-musk-twitter-is-overdue-a-shake-up) for the social-media firm. He also sought to delay the trial that will determine whether or not he must honour the acquisition agreement by about a month, to November.

In a joint statement Germany and France warned against banning <strong>Russian tourists </strong>from [entering the EU](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/03/04/russians-are-trying-to-flee-putins-chaos), saying it could estrange future generations. Other European countries, such as the Czech Republic and Denmark, have advocated for such a step. EU ministers will discuss the proposal on Tuesday as they weigh up further [sanctions on Russia](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/24/western-sanctions-will-eventually-impair-russias-economy) for its attack on Ukraine.

<strong>Mississippi’s</strong> governor declared a state of emergency in the city of Jackson, after floods damaged the water-treatment system and left 180,000 people without potable water. Residents were told to drink bottled water “for an unknown period of time”. Jackson’s <strong>water crisis</strong> is not new: in 2020 America’s Environmental Protection Agency warned of [lead pipes](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2021/12/02/where-are-americas-lead-pipes) and other problems there.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>80, the number of captured soldiers from Ukraine’s Azov regiment facing a Russian-controlled trial. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/28/russia-prepares-an-international-tribunal-for-the-ukrainian-defenders-of-mariupol).

## A pivotal moment in Ukraine

On the eighth anniversary of a massacre of Ukrainian soldiers in Donetsk province the Ukrainian army [launched an offensive](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/29/ukraine-starts-a-push-to-recapture-kherson-a-crucial-russian-occupied-city) against Russian forces in Kherson, a southern province. The historical resonance will have been clear to many of the fighters.

Kherson was the first big city to fall after Russia invaded in February. Ukrainian generals have hinted for months that they were preparing a [counter-offensive](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/14/a-ukrainian-counter-offensive-in-kherson-faces-steep-odds), and in the early afternoon on Monday they launched the attack. The Ukrainians laid the groundwork the night before, by striking key bridges and Russian command points.

Penetrating Russia’s second line of defence will be harder. Fighting on Tuesday will be crucial in determining Kherson’s fate. But Ukraine believes it is seizing the initiative. The frontlines of the war have barely moved since late June. If Ukraine has now found a weak spot in Russia’s armour, it could mark the beginning of a new phase of the conflict.

## The Taliban’s empty promises

One year ago on Tuesday, Major-General Chris Donahue, the commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, stepped aboard a C-17 transport plane at Kabul airport. He was the last American soldier to leave Afghanistan after more than two decades of war, following the Taliban’s conquest of the capital.

At that time, the Islamist group pledged to protect women’s rights and to forgive those who had worked for the American-led coalition. Those promises have [proven hollow](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/11/afghanistan-is-poorer-and-hungrier-than-a-year-ago). Morality police patrol the streets to ensure that women are covered up. Girls are barred from secondary school. The economy is in free fall. And al-Qaeda, a terrorist group, is ensconsed in Afghanistan once more—its leader, [Ayman al-Zawahiri](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/02/the-death-of-al-qaedas-leader-may-not-halt-a-jihadist-resurgence), was in a wealthy Kabul neighbourhood when an American drone strike killed him this month. Though violence [has fallen](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/08/15/violence-in-afghanistan-has-dropped-under-the-taliban) precipitously, it is hardly the sort of peace that Afghans might have hoped for.

## EU ministers discuss Russia

Ministers in the EU resume their regular meetings this week, after a summer break. Russia’s war in Ukraine will dominate the proceedings of an informal gathering of the bloc’s 27 foreign ministers in Prague on Tuesday. Countries in central and eastern Europe are keen to [ban the issuance](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/25/as-the-war-in-ukraine-drags-on-the-costs-for-europe-are-mounting) of visas to Russian citizens, to emphasise their isolation. But leaders in western Europe are sceptical, fearing that such an act smacks of collective punishment.

A compromise looks more likely, whereby Russia would lose preferential treatment when applying for European visas, a perk given to friendly countries. This would lumber Russian travellers with higher costs and longer waiting times. It might also mollify countries such as Finland, a firm ally of Ukraine’s, which have been used by Russians as a layover point for further international travel.

## Pakistan’s devastating floods

While droughts plague other parts of the world, swathes of South Asia are submerged by floodwaters, nowhere worse than in Pakistan. Glacial melt from the Himalayas supercharged reservoirs in May; unseasonal monsoon rains then plunged the countryside into catastrophe. Official estimates put the death toll above 1,100, including 348 children. History suggests much worse is to come. Sherry Rehman, the minister for climate change, called it a “climate dystopia at our doorstep”.

Pakistan faces concurrent exposure to other forms of distress. On Monday the IMF’s executive board approved the final tranches of a $6bn loan facility drawn up earlier this year. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Pakistan’s foreign minister, had invoked the billions that will be lost to failed crops, and his country’s negligible carbon-footprint-per-capita, to plead its case. He has reason to feel desperate. Commodity prices and inflationary pressures already had Pakistan’s economy on the ropes, even before the clouds burst.

## The people’s princess redux

A quarter of a century has passed since Diana, Princess of Wales, died in a car crash in Paris. At fault was her driver, and her own failure to wear a seatbelt. A jury also found that the “grossly negligent” driving of paparazzi had contributed to her death. The “people’s princess” still commands intense media attention, even if it has grown increasingly difficult to find any scrap of new information about her life. Two documentaries—Sky’s “The Princess” and Channel 4’s “Investigating Diana: Death in Paris”—were recently released. The fifth season of “The Crown”, later this year, will keep her in the spotlight.

Princess Diana was personally shy of the media. Her most notable interview was in 1995 with Martin Bashir, of the BBC, in a scoop that an inquiry ruled last year was obtained by deceit on Mr Bashir’s part. Others in her family, particularly her youngest son, the [Duke of Sussex](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2020/01/16/harry-meghan-and-marx), have been [more forthcoming](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2021/03/08/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-take-on-the-firm). But none has been as successful in garnering public sympathy. Princess Diana was[ a master of the politics of emotion](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2020/11/14/how-princess-diana-shaped-politics) in a way that hasn’t been replicated since.
