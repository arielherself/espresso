<strong>America</strong>,<strong> France</strong> and <strong>Germany</strong> agreed to send armoured combat vehicles to <strong>Ukraine</strong>, after long resisting such aid for fear that Russia would view it as [escalatory](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/giving-ukraine-heavy-weapons-does-not-mean-nato-is-at-war-with-russia/21808835). America will supply Bradley vehicles, France will send AMX-10RCs and Germany is donating Marders and also a Patriot missile-defence system. Separately, <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> ordered a unilateral ceasefire between noon on Friday and midnight Saturday to mark Orthodox Christmas. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, called the gesture a tactical ploy. 

<strong>Kevin McCarthy </strong>is no closer to becoming Speaker of America’s House of Representatives after losing an [11th vote](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/01/04/what-the-kevin-mccarthy-saga-means-for-americas-congress)—making this the most protracted election since 1859. Twenty right-wing Republican holdouts have refused to accept his concessions. “The deal is over with him. He does not have the votes,” said Lauren Boebert, one of the rebels. Mr McCarthy needs to win over at least sixteen.

<strong>China</strong> plans to relax its stringent “[three red lines](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/15/chinas-property-crisis-hasnt-gone-away-it-is-getting-worse)” policy that restricts borrowing by <strong>property developers</strong>, according to Bloomberg. Regulators could lift borrowing caps on some property firms while extending the grace period for meeting debt targets. The government is desperate to revive China’s battered real-estate sector. 

<strong>Samsung’s </strong>profit in the last quarter of 2022 [slumped](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/09/29/why-some-chipmakers-are-hurting-much-more-than-others) to its lowest level in eight years amid the global economic slowdown. The South Korean electronics giant estimated that profits sank by 69% year on year to 4.3tn won ($3.4bn). Sales fell across the board but memory chips and smartphones were hit particularly hard. Analysts expect the firm’s profits to fall again in this quarter.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

The <strong>Biden administration</strong> said it would begin [rapidly expelling](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/12/20/title-42-might-be-nixed) <strong>migrants </strong>from America, including asylum-seekers, from Cuba, Haiti and Nicaragua at its border with Mexico. Until now they were exempt from expulsion, unlike citizens from other countries, since Mexico had refused to accept them. But Mexico will now take 30,000 from each country a month. The same number can apply to enter America if sponsored by an American.

<strong>Crypto’s</strong> [woes](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/17/is-this-the-end-of-crypto) worsened as two firms reported big layoffs. Genesis Trading, a lender, cut 30% of its workforce and could reportedly face bankruptcy; the firm had counted Alameda Research, Sam Bankman-Fried’s now-defunct trading firm, as a client. Silvergate, a bank, saw its share price nearly halve after it sacked 200 employees. Separately, New York’s attorney-general filed civil fraud charges against the co-founder of the bankrupt Celsius Network.

<strong>Mexico’s</strong> army arrested <strong>Ovidio Guzmán L</strong><strong>ó</strong><strong>pez</strong>, a son of [Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzmán](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2018/11/16/the-trial-of-el-chapo-and-the-crime-fighting-plan-of-amlo) and an alleged fentanyl trafficker, in the state of Sinaloa. A high-ranking member of the drug cartel that his father once ran, Mr Guzmán López was briefly captured in 2019. But after his gang retaliated violently, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador ordered his release in an embarrassing reversal.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 46%, the share of people in Britain saying that immigration has a positive effect on the country, up from around 35% in 2015. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2023/01/03/the-impact-of-brexit-in-charts).

## Tech’s annual jamboree in Sin City

On Thursday the Consumer Electronics Show kicks off in Las Vegas. Some 100,000 people from over 170 countries are expected to take the opportunity to play with the latest gadgetry from more than 3,000 companies. As well as the usual launches of consumer-tech products, the glitzy event will see carmakers [showcasing flashy new features](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/01/08/cars-meet-chips-in-sin-city). In 2022, GM and Mercedes-Benz announced innovations to their electric vehicles. One attraction this year will be a race around the Las Vegas Speedway between cars driven by artificial intelligence.

But the show comes at a rough time for the tech industry. Share prices were battered in 2022; the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index [fell](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/12/24/how-techs-defiance-of-economic-gravity-came-to-an-abrupt-end) by about one-quarter. Firms from Amazon to Zillow have announced layoffs. And 2023 offers little hope for a rebound: analysts forecast that 40 of the world’s 100 biggest technology firms will see revenues shrink. That is no mood for a party, even in Vegas.

## Mounting tensions in Jerusalem

A visit by Israel’s national-security minister to one of the world’s most contentious religious sites has highlighted the radical tendencies of Binyamin Netanyahu’s new government. On Tuesday [Itamar Ben-Gvir](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/11/03/who-is-itamar-ben-gvir-israels-kingmaker), leader of an ultra-nationalist party in Mr Netanyahu’s coalition, visited Jerusalem’s Temple Mount, near the al-Aqsa mosque, despite warnings of violent protests. So far these have not materialised. But the action, condemned by Arab regimes, has led the United Arab Emirates to postpone a proposed visit by Mr Netanyahu that had been scheduled for next week.

Mr Ben-Gvir’s portfolio gives him control of police and a new paramilitary “national guard”, while other far-right ministers plan to expand the construction of settlements in the occupied West Bank. That risks further escalating tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. Mr Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, is now beholden to his [firebrand partners](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/10/the-changing-nature-of-israeli-politics) and finding it difficult to rein them in.

## North Korea’s nuclear weapons

North Korea started the year with a bang, testing a “super-large multiple rocket system”. Kim Jong Un, the country’s dictator, boasted that it could carry a nuclear payload to anywhere on the Korean peninsula. He also called for an “exponential increase” in North Korea’s nuclear arsenal.

This suggests that North Korea intends to spend 2023 as it did the previous year: testing new weapons and [honing its ability to use them](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/10/18/north-korea-is-preparing-for-another-nuclear-test-or-many). The stock response from South Korea and America—issuing stern threats and matching North Korean muscle-flexing with reciprocal displays of force—is also unlikely to change. Far from de-escalating, Yoon Suk-yeul, South Korea’s president, has said the country should consider suspending a five-year-old agreement with North Korea that limits military exercises. Seventy years after the armistice that silenced the guns of the Korean war in 1953, peace seems a distant prospect.

## A death-penalty case in South Carolina

Lethal injection can be a gruesome way to die. In America, where it is the main [method of capital punishment](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/12/15/south-carolina-wants-to-execute-an-inmate-by-firing-squad), such executions are often botched. Drug manufacturers, wanting nothing to do with the practice, have largely stopped supplying the necessary ingredients. That has left some states scrambling for alternatives. In 2020 South Carolina joined Mississippi, Oklahoma and Utah in allowing executions by firing squad—a rare method used to execute only three people since 1976, all in Utah—when lethal injections are unavailable.

But Richard Moore, a death-row inmate faced with a choice between firing squad and South Carolina’s 110-year-old electric chair, argues that neither method is constitutional. On Thursday the state’s supreme court will consider whether he can be executed by firing squad. Whatever the court decides, such cases will only hasten a [reconsidering of capital punishment](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2021/01/21/use-of-the-death-penalty-in-america-may-be-ending) in America altogether. Thirty-seven states have either abolished the death penalty or executed no prisoners in more than a decade. Capital punishment may be approaching its last gasp.

## Dhaka Lit Fest is back

Since it began in 2011, the annual celebration of Bangladesh’s literary culture has faced some severe challenges. Most notably, in 2015 many speakers dropped out following a spate of [attacks on secular writers](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2015/05/14/the-third-casualty) by machete-wielding Islamists. Since then the avowedly secular festival has pitted itself as a defender of free speech in a publishing industry dominated by Islamic books and religious censorship.

After a three-year covid hiatus, on Thursday the festival returned with an impressive line-up. [Abdulrazak Gurnah](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2021/10/07/abdulrazak-gurnah-wins-the-nobel-prize-in-literature-for-2021), a Nobel-prizewinning author and Tilda Swinton, a British actress, join acclaimed South Asian writers such as [Shehan Karunatilaka](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/08/18/shehan-karunatilaka-returns-with-another-thrilling-satire), Amitav Ghosh, Saad Z. Hossain and Geetanjali Shree, who won the International Booker prize in 2022.

But organisers face a backlash against newly introduced ticket prices. And critics charge that the festival fails to address the[ government’s ](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2021/03/27/as-it-turns-50-bangladesh-is-doing-well-despite-its-politicians)draconian [censorship laws](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2021/03/06/indias-government-follows-bangladeshs-in-policing-social-media). Speaking out, though, risks the event, sponsored by the culture ministry, being cancelled for good.
