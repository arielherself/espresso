<strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>, Russia’s president, gave a national address in which he announced “<strong>partial mobilisation</strong>”, meaning that Russians with experience in the army or the reserves may be [conscripted](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/20/vladimir-putins-situation-looks-ever-more-desperate). Sergei Shoigu, the defence minister, said that <strong>300,000 reservists</strong> will be drafted. Mr Putin also threatened the use of [nuclear weapons](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/06/02/russias-invasion-of-ukraine-has-eroded-the-nuclear-taboo), and accused the West of plotting to destroy Russia. The Russian army has recently [ceded huge tracts of occupied territory](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/15/russian-discontent-with-the-war-and-vladimir-putin-is-growing) to advancing Ukrainian forces. On Tuesday the lower house of Russia’s parliament passed a bill mandating harsher penalties for deserting the army or refusing to fight.

Mr Putin also promised full support to four <strong>referendums</strong> in [Russian-controlled parts](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/20/vladimir-putins-situation-looks-ever-more-desperate) of <strong>Ukraine</strong>, scheduled to begin on Friday. On Tuesday officials in the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia, which together make up 15% of Ukraine’s sovereign territory, said residents would vote on whether to formally join Russia. Russian-ruled parts of the Mykolaiv region will take part in Kherson’s referendum. Western governments expect the Kremlin to manipulate the results, and plan not to recognise them. 

The Asian Development Bank cut its <strong>growth</strong> forecasts for emerging economies in <strong>Asia</strong>, including China and India. The region’s growth-rate estimate for 2022 has been revised down to 4.3% (from 5.2% in April) because of rising inflation and China’s zero-covid policy. China’s economy is expected to grow by 3.3%, which would be a [slower rate](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/09/20/chinas-rulers-seem-resigned-to-a-slowing-economy) than other Asian emerging economies for the first time in 30 years.

World leaders met in <strong>New York</strong> at the <strong>UN General Assembly</strong>, the annual UN summit, held in person for the first time in three years. The war in Ukraine dominated proceedings as several leaders condemned Russia’s invasion and pledged support to Ukraine. President Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelensky, his Ukrainian counterpart, are scheduled to speak on Wednesday.

<strong>Hurricane Fiona</strong> strengthened as it moved towards Bermuda and away from the Turks and Caicos Islands. Over the past few days the storm has left a trail of disruption and destruction in numerous parts of the Caribbean. Thousands of homes in Puerto Rico remain flooded, and most residents are still without power and safe drinking water. Deaths have been reported in the Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe and Puerto Rico. 

<strong>Germany</strong> finalised a deal to nationalise <strong>Uniper</strong>, the country’s biggest natural-gas importer. Under the “stabilisation package”, the federal government will inject €8bn into the firm, which has been hit hard by the recent [turmoil in energy markets](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/01/how-to-prevent-europes-energy-crunch-spiralling-into-an-economic-crisis). The government is also in talks with two other gas suppliers about potential takeovers as it seeks to avert an energy crisis.

<strong>Eritrean </strong>troops began a large offensive in the Tigray region of <strong>Ethiopia</strong>, according to a spokesman for rebels there. Neither country’s government has yet commented. In August [a fragile ceasefire](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/07/why-has-ethiopias-ceasefire-failed) between the Ethiopian government and the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front, a party-cum-militia, fell apart. The two sides have been embroiled in a civil war since 2020, with Eritrea intervening on behalf of the government.

## Another jumbo rate rise from the Fed

As recently as the start of June, it seemed inconceivable to most investors that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, a jumbo increase by modern standards. But on Wednesday it is expected to announce its third consecutive [increase](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/07/27/the-fed-is-no-longer-taking-baby-steps-to-rein-in-inflation) of that magnitude. If so, the Fed will have lifted short-term interest rates from 0% in March to 3% today, its sharpest monetary tightening in four decades.

Frustratingly, there is scant evidence that the Fed’s hawkishness has reined in inflation. Consumer prices in August were [up](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/09/13/america-still-has-an-inflation-problem) by 8.3% compared with a year earlier. So some think the Fed may opt for an even bigger rate increase. But others worry that it is at risk of over-tightening, and [damaging growth](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/14/to-fix-americas-inflation-problem-the-federal-reserve-must-go-big). No matter: the Fed is unlikely to relent until it sees clear signs that inflation is receding.

## What next for Ukraine and Russia?

The mobilisation of 300,000 Russian reservists will begin on Wednesday, after President Vladimir Putin announced he was ramping up his country’s efforts in its calamitous war in Ukraine. Will that be enough to turn the tide? Perhaps not. Although Sergei Shoigu, the defence minister, says Russia will only call on those with military experience, there is [no simple way](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/20/vladimir-putins-situation-looks-ever-more-desperate) to quickly train, equip and find officers for a vastly expanded army. It may also prove unpopular at home.

In a delayed address, Mr Putin also gave his blessing to plans to begin absorbing four Russian-occupied Ukrainian provinces into Russia. On Tuesday officials from those Russian puppet regimes announced that referendums—widely expected to be rigged—would be held from September 23rd to 27th. But Ukraine’s army, having [swept through Kharkiv](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/18/where-next-for-ukraines-army) province in the north-east, is still probing Russian lines. On Monday it announced the capture of Bilohorivka in Luhansk, one of those provinces the Kremlin wants to annex. 

## An awkward anniversary in the Philippines

Every year, on September 21st, survivors of the cruel, corrupt regime of Ferdinand Marcos, the late ex-president of the Philippines, commemorate the anniversary of his declaration of martial law in 1972. That move transformed him into an autocrat. The “never again” message of their demonstrations on Wednesday was more heartfelt than usual. That is both because this year is the 50th anniversary of the declaration, and because Marcos’s son, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, now occupies the office his father once did. 

In May, an electorate mostly too young to remember the older regime voted overwhelmingly to make Bongbong president. Survivors of the father’s violent enormities were horrified. Yet anxiety among the opposition that a tendency towards autocracy runs in the Marcos blood seems unfounded, so far. The younger Mr Marcos appears to believe that the best way for him to rehabilitate the Marcos dynasty is to respect the very democratic constitution written after a popular uprising overthrew his father in 1986.

## Brazil’s economy, ahead of its election

Analysts expect policymakers at Brazil’s central bank meeting on Wednesday to keep the country’s key interest rate unchanged at 13.75%. The worst of Brazil’s economic woes seem to be over. Having risen steadily since June 2020, monthly inflation fell in July and August. GDP grew by 1.2% in the second quarter compared with the first. The unemployment rate, which reached nearly 15% in 2021, has fallen to just above 9%. 

President Jair Bolsonaro, who is seeking [re-election](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/04/02/brazils-presidential-election-in-october-will-be-about-the-economy) on October 2nd, claims that Brazil has emerged from the pandemic with a “thriving economy”. But that may be premature. Economists polled by the central bank expect the economy to grow by 2.7% in 2022, but by just 0.5% in 2023, as emergency spending fades away. Either way, Mr Bolsonaro’s boasts do not seem to have borne political fruit. Polls find the president trailing the opposition candidate and former president, [Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/09/19/how-left-wing-on-economics-is-luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva), by 12 percentage points.

## Most people with dementia get no support

At least 55m people worldwide are estimated to have dementia, a number expected to reach 139m-150m [by 2050](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/01/11/dementia-will-affect-more-than-150m-people-worldwide-by-2050). Dementia, which may begin as a few “senior moments” but progress to utter helplessness requiring 24-hour care, is incurable. But it can be alleviated. Yet the vast majority with the condition receive little or no support from their governments. So says the latest report, published on Wednesday, of Alzheimer’s Disease International, an umbrella group for more than 100 national associations around the world. (The organisation is named for the disease that is the most common cause of dementia.) 

The report includes a survey suggesting that, of those diagnosed with dementia, 37% in rich countries and 45% in lower-income countries receive no support after diagnosis. It is left to their families to look after them. And these are in a sense the lucky ones: three-quarters of dementia cases are undiagnosed. That leaves more than 45m people with dementia receiving no professional help.
