 **America’s** president, Joe Biden, said his country would [not cede the Middle East](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/07/12/what-does-the-middle-east-offer-america) to China or Russia, during a summit in the Saudi city of Jeddah. “The United States is not going anywhere,” he told the heads of nine Arab states. Yet Mr Biden failed to secure a commitment from **Saudi Arabia** to increase energy output in coming weeks to tamp down rising prices. The summit also dashed American hopes for a regional security axis, that would include Israel, to counter Iranian threats.

 **Wildfires** tore through south-western Europe and north Africa as temperature soared above 45°C in several places. In the French department of Gironde about 14,000 people have been forced to leave their homes and 1,200 firefighters are battling the flames. More than 3,000 people have also been evacuated in Spain’s province of Malaga. [Temperatures are expected to rise further still](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/04/16/in-chilly-parts-of-europe-heatwaves-strengthen-environmentalism) over the next few days; Britain has issued its first-ever “extreme heat” warning.

 **Iran** has imposed sanctions on 61 Americans, accusing them of backing an exiled dissident group that wants to end the country’s clerical regime. The latest blacklist includes officials who served under President Donald Trump, including secretary of state Mike Pompeo, attorney Rudy Giuliani and White House national security adviser John Bolton. While the sanctions are mostly symbolic—they allow authorities to seize any Iran-based assets owned by the 61—they come as America’s efforts [to revive the 2015 nuclear pact](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/nuclear-talks-with-iran-enter-the-endgame/21807592) falter.

 **Russia** ’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, ordered units to ramp up attacks in order to pre-empt Ukrainian [strikes on occupied areas](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/06/30/does-a-protracted-conflict-favour-russia-or-ukraine). **Ukraine** accused Russia of terrorising civilians by firing long-range missiles at crowded residential blocks, [industrial plants](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/14/the-war-is-forcing-ukraines-energy-planners-to-be-creative), schools and shops. Russia said the target of its cruise-missile strike on Vinnytsia on Thursday was a meeting between officials and foreign arms suppliers.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

Mexico said it had arrested **Rafael Caro Quintero** , a founding member of the powerful Guadalajara Cartel, during a military operation in the north-western state of Sinaloa. The drugs lord is on [America’s most-wanted list](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2013/08/17/ghosts-of-the-past) for the kidnapping and murder of an American anti-narcotics agent in 1985. Officials said they would seek the fugitive’s immediate extradition.

 **Sri Lanka** ’s parliament convened to begin the process of electing a new president to replace Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was ousted after [mass protests](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/09/sri-lankas-president-resigns-in-the-face-of-massive-protests) and this week [fled to Singapore](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/13/sri-lankas-president-flees-leaving-the-country-in-chaos) from where he submitted his resignation letter. On Tuesday it will accept nominations for his successor. The acting president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, wants the job, as does the leader of the opposition, Sajith Premadasa.

A televised debate between the five candidates to [succeed Boris Johnson](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/07/12/the-conservative-party-after-boris-johnson) as leader of the Conservative Party and **Britain’s prime minister** entailed tetchy squabbles over how to finance public spending, and the rivals’ credentials. **Rishi Sunak** , who won the first two rounds of voting, was criticised for raising taxes when he was [chancellor of the exchequer](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/03/19/does-rishi-sunak-have-the-stomach-for-what-he-must-swallow), as was **Penny Mordaunt** , the [bookmakers’ favourite](https://www.economist.com/interactive/2022/07/12/the-race-to-become-britains-next-pm), for her record as equalities minister.

## Sunday night Tory-vision

The five remaining [contenders](https://www.economist.com/interactive/2022/07/12/the-race-to-become-britains-next-pm) vying to [succeed Boris Johnson](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/07/12/the-conservative-party-after-boris-johnson) as leader of Britain’s Conservative Party—and with it, prime minister of the country—will face each other in a televised debate on Sunday evening. The contenders are [Liz Truss](https://www.economist.com/britain/2021/04/08/liz-truss-and-the-power-of-perkiness), the foreign secretary; [Rishi Sunak](https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/11/26/rishi-sunak-thatcherite-at-heart), a former chancellor; [Tom Tugendhat](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2022/07/13/tom-tugendhat-on-his-ten-year-plan-for-britains-growth), the chairman of the foreign affairs committee; [Penny Mordaunt](https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/05/09/penny-mordaunt-is-on-manoeuvres), a trade minister; and [Kemi Badenoch](https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/10/03/the-tories-launch-a-culture-war), a former local-government minister. The first debate was held on Friday, and the last one will take place on Tuesday.

The candidates should expect to be grilled on Britain’s battle with inflation, the war in Ukraine and how they can restore trust to British politics after Mr Johnson’s scandal-hit tenure. Although all Britons can tune in to see their future leader, most will be [powerless to vote](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/07/14/britains-prime-minister-becomes-a-rotten-presidency). That right belongs only to Conservative MPs, who this week will whittle down the contenders to a final two, and then around 180,000 members of the party who will be balloted to choose a winner over summer.

## An ugly fight for Wisconsin

For the Democratic Party to improve its [hold on America’s Senate](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/05/18/republicans-divide-and-democrats-unite-in-the-pennsylvania-primaries) in November it needs to win Wisconsin. On Sunday Democrats vying for the party’s nomination will hold a debate, ahead of the primary election in August.

In Wisconsin, which narrowly voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and then for Joe Biden in 2020, a good Democratic candidate should have a chance. But the fight for the nomination has turned ugly. [Mandela Barnes](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2019/11/07/milwaukees-north-side-remains-deeply-troubled), the state’s 35-year-old lieutenant-governor, has led the polls for months. But Alex Lasry, the 34-year-old son of a billionaire hedge-funder, has spent $6m of his own money catching up. Mr Barnes is a progressive who rails against “millionaire” politicians; Mr Lasry is more centrist.

Whoever secures the nomination will face Ron Johnson, the Republican incumbent, who says that climate change is a hoax and covid-19 is better tackled with deworming tablets than vaccines. The Democrats have made the race to unseat Mr Johnson tougher than it ought to be.

## North Carolina goes Hollywood

Any folksy, romantic [American bestseller](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/05/14/the-highway-code-tops-the-bestseller-lists-again) is bound to be made into a movie. But not necessarily a noteworthy one. (“The Horse Whisperer” or “The Bridges of Madison County” are two forgettable examples.) The latest is “Where The Crawdads Sing”, an adaptation of Delia Owens’s debut novel. The book has sold over 12m copies since its publication in 2018. The inevitable film, produced by Reese Witherspoon, is out in America now and in Britain on July 22nd.

Daisy Edgar-Jones, the British star of “[Normal People](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2020/04/29/a-faithful-careful-adaptation-of-sally-rooneys-normal-people)”, a television series, plays Kya, a poetic loner who grew up alone in a North Carolina marshland. In 1950s flashbacks, her abusive father abandons her; in 1969, she is tried for the murder of her ex-boyfriend (another Brit, Harris Dickinson).

Most of the novel’s mystery plot has survived the transfer to the big screen, but little of its much-praised authenticity. The film makes life in a backwoods shack seem like an idyllic glamping holiday. Such is Hollywood.

## Cold-war games on a summer’s day

Fifty years after it was played, actors in London will recreate one of the most [famous chess games](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2008/11/20/pawnography) in history. In the 1972 world championship [Bobby Fisher,](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2008/01/24/bobby-fischer) an idiosyncratic American prodigy, played Boris Spassky, a Russian who shunned the Communist Party. After 21 games Fischer convincingly defeated the defending champion. Thus ended 24 years of Soviet dominance. 

Chess was a political game during the cold war. Both players were under huge pressure to win. Henry Kissinger, later America’s secretary of state, encouraged Fischer to play. Mr Spassky, whose loss irked the Kremlin as much as his sympathy for dissidents, emigrated to France four years later. 

Game three of the match will be commemorated during ChessFest, held in Trafalgar Square on Sunday, by actors playing the 32 pieces. The American lost the first game and controversially forfeited the second, so his win in the third proved a turning point. Fischer died in 2008, but Mr Spassky can still enjoy the show.

## Weekend profile: Penny Mordaunt, Britain’s next prime minister?

Penny Mordaunt has emerged as the [bookies’ favourite](https://www.economist.com/interactive/2022/07/12/the-race-to-become-britains-next-pm) to succeed Boris Johnson as leader of the Conservative Party, and thus as Britain’s prime minister. Last week she finished second in the first two ballots of Conservative MPs, who next week will whittle down the five remaining candidates to a final pair. The party’s 100,000-or-so members will then have the final say, with the winner to be announced in early September. If Ms Mordaunt makes it that far, she stands a good chance of triumphing. Separate surveys conducted by ConservativeHome, a grassroots website, and YouGov, a pollster, found that she is the favourite among party members. Yet Ms Mordaunt is unknown outside Westminster. What do the Tories see in her?

Ms Mordaunt was born in 1973. Her mother died when she was 15, and her father, a former paratrooper, fell ill the following year, leaving her to care for her younger brother until her father remarried. She worked as a magician’s assistant to help fund her philosophy studies at the University of Reading. When she joined the leadership race, Ms Mordaunt said her “love and pride” of Britain was kindled as a nine-year-old in Portsmouth, as she watched the navy set sail for [war in the Falklands](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/04/02/the-falklands-war-resonates-40-years-on). Her naval interest seems preordained: she was named after <em>HMS Penelope</em>, a cruiser. She serves as a navy reservist, and was elected as the Conservative MP for Portsmouth North in 2010. 

Ms Mordaunt’s supporters say her rise reflects the party’s appetite for change after the scandal and decadence of Mr Johnson’s tenure. They describe her as hard-working and dutiful, provincial rather than metropolitan. She supported Brexit, but is not fervent about the divorce. In “Greater: Britain After the Storm”, a book she co-authored last year, she offers an affectionate portrait of modern Britain as a good-humoured land of the NHS, pubs and the Human Rights Act. Her policies tend to focus on local communities rather than grand national ideas. One of her ideas is for MPs to be given pots of money to distribute to good causes in their constituencies. She would like to see a bigger role for charities, and for the volunteers who rallied during covid-19 to be put to work permanently.

The video that announced her candidacy was subject to much mockery in Westminster. It featured rolling shots of Britain, set to “I Vow to Thee My Country”, a patriotic ditty. Party members were not so sniffy. Ms Mordaunt’s ideological ambiguity has made her an attractive default candidate for MPs who dislike Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor and current frontrunner, and Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, her main rival for that second place. Yet even her supporters admit she is untested, and that the success of her notional premiership would depend on whether she would be prepared to appoint strong rivals to big posts, or rely on yes-men—as Mr Johnson did.
