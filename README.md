Jens Stoltenberg,<strong> NATO’s</strong> secretary general, said that the new <strong>Russian offensive </strong>against Ukraine has already begun, and that Russia will send “more troops, more weapons” into the war. Mr Stoltenberg, who is meeting with defence ministers in Brussels on Tuesday, said that leaders would discuss the possibility of [sending aircraft](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2023/02/01/why-does-ukraine-want-western-jets-and-will-it-get-them) to Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, renewed pleas for jets last week. 

<strong>Syria’s</strong> government agreed to open two border crossings to allow more aid into the country from <strong>Turkey</strong> following [devastating earthquakes](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/02/09/the-earthquakes-in-turkey-and-syria-have-shaken-both-countries) last week. The UN has so far only been able to deliver aid to Syria via one crossing. Meanwhile, more survivors were found in Turkey on Monday, but a UN spokesperson warned that the rescue phase was drawing to a close. The death toll has now passed 36,000. 

America’s army recovered sensors from a suspected <strong>Chinese spy balloon </strong>from the Atlantic Ocean. An American fighter jet shot the balloon down near South Carolina on February 4th. The FBI is now examining the debris. Since February 4th America has shot down three [unidentified objects](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/02/09/cold-war-lessons-from-chinas-spy-balloon) in North American airspace. China has also accused America of illegally flying balloons in its airspace.

<strong>New Zealand </strong>declared a national state of emergency for only the third time in its history as <strong>Cyclone Gabrielle</strong> battered Auckland, its biggest city, and surrounding areas. The storm has swept away roads, forced many to evacuate their homes and left more than 100,000 people without electricity. Last month Auckland was hit by [floods](https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2022/09/05/heatwaves-and-floods-around-the-world-may-be-a-taste-of-years-to-come) that killed four people.

<strong>Japan’s economy </strong>avoided a recession in the last quarter of 2022, but expanded at a slower than expected rate. Annualised economic growth was 0.6%, a rebound from the 1% contraction in the previous quarter but far lower than forecasts of 2%. Separately, the government appointed <strong>Ueda Kazuo</strong> as the next governor of the central bank. He is expected to continue implementing the [Bank of Japan’s](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/02/02/the-bank-of-japan-should-stop-defending-its-cap-on-bond-yields) ultra-loose monetary policy.

Maia Sandu, <strong>Moldova’s</strong> president, accused Russia of making plans to take down her government using external saboteurs. In a briefing, [Ms Sandu](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/moldova-is-trying-to-stay-out-of-russias-war-with-ukraine/21809093) said that Russia intended to disrupt Moldova’s plans to join the European Union. Mr Zelensky told EU leaders last week that Ukraine had intercepted communications outlining an alleged scheme by the Russian Secret Service to destroy Moldova.

<strong>Mars Wrigley</strong>, a chocolate manufacturer, was fined $14,500 after two workers fell into a vat of melted chocolate last year. They had been hired to clean the tanks in a factory in Pennsylvania, but neither had received proper training on safety procedures. A hole had to be cut into the bottom of the contraption to rescue the fallen contractors.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>37%, the share of women in Saudi Arabia with a job or looking for one. In 2017 it was 17%. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/02/09/arab-petrostates-must-prepare-their-citizens-for-a-post-oil-future).

## Turkey’s corrupt construction in the spotlight

By Sunday, Turkish officials had issued at least 113 arrest warrants for architects, engineers and contractors they claim are responsible for buildings that collapsed during [catastrophic earthquakes](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/02/09/the-earthquakes-in-turkey-and-syria-have-shaken-both-countries) on February 6th. More warrants are expected in the next few days as the death toll, now higher than 34,000 in Turkey and in neighbouring Syria, spirals upward.

Many believe that the government is pointing the finger in the wrong direction. Although Turkey has strict building codes meant to protect against quakes, corruption and bad policymaking mean that they are poorly enforced. Analysts say that much of the blame lies with the governments of [President Recep Tayyip Erdogan](https://te.arielherself.xyz/special-report/2023-01-21) and his predecessors and with municipal politicians.

The construction industry is riddled with weak links. The companies tasked with carrying out inspections to make sure standards are met are often paid by developers. Mr Erdogan’s government has also passed a series of amnesties, which allow illegal properties to be registered in exchange for a fine. The agency that carried out the most recent amnesty, in 2018, found that more than half of the country’s housing stock was not up to scratch. 

## America, Japan and South Korea seek to co-operate

Senior officials from America, Japan and South Korea meet in Washington, DC on Monday. They hope to boost security co-operation in the face of threats from North Korea and [China](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2023/02/09/tensions-will-linger-over-a-chinese-balloon-downed-by-america). America has long wanted to work more closely with its two key east Asian allies, but tensions over Japan’s colonial history in South Korea have hampered efforts thus far. Dialogue among the three countries has picked up in the past year following the election of Yoon Suk-yeol, a conservative, as president of South Korea. Three-way military exercises, which had halted in 2017, resumed in 2022. 

But the past still presents a barrier to preparing for the future. In 2018 South Korea’s Supreme Court upheld rulings ordering Japanese firms to compensate South Koreans forced to work in factories during the second world war. Japan, which considers such claims settled through a treaty signed in 1965, was aghast. Efforts to negotiate a settlement have not yet borne fruit.

## A shakeup of Biden’s economic team

President Joe Biden’s top economic adviser is expected to step down in the coming days. The departure of Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, is part of a wider turnover in White House staff at the two-year mark of [Mr Biden’s presidency](https://te.arielherself.xyz/president-joe-biden-polls). Mr Deese played an important role in pushing the administration towards a bold economic strategy—an approach that brought legislative victories but also helped cause high inflation.

Mr Deese advocated a giant stimulus package in early 2021 to counter the economic slowdown induced by the pandemic. He also helped to craft the Inflation Reduction Act, a big climate-investment bill that passed last year. His successor is yet to be named. Reports indicate that the leading candidates are Wally Adeyemo, deputy secretary of the Treasury, and Lael Brainard, vice chair of the Federal Reserve. Whoever takes the job will have their hands full trying to implement Mr Deese’s designs.

## Giorgia Meloni’s first ballot box test

Results are expected on Monday from regional elections in Lombardy, which includes Milan, and Lazio, which takes in Rome. The vote—in which almost a quarter of Italian voters can participate—is the first test of electoral support for the right-wing coalition led by [Giorgia Meloni](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/01/26/after-a-steady-first-100-days-choppier-waters-await-giorgia-meloni), the prime minister. Few observers doubt that her alliance will do well. The lack of suspense appears to have depressed turnout. When polls closed on Sunday evening the turnout was under 30% compared with more than 70% at the last comparable elections.

The right is predicted to hold Lombardy, which it has governed for almost 30 years. Polls also suggest that it will snatch Lazio from a divided left. The biggest unknown is whether a result that confirms increased support for Ms Meloni’s Brothers of Italy (FdI) party will exacerbate tensions with her coalition partners, the Northern League and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party. The poll ratings of both have been reduced to single digits by FdI’s success.

## Abstract Expressionism gets a new narrative

Abstract Expressionism has long been regarded as one of the most clearly defined artistic movements of the 20th century. But a new show in London challenges orthodoxy. “Action, Gesture, Paint: Women Artists and Global Abstraction 1940-70” opened at the Whitechapel Gallery on Thursday, and will run until May 7th. It offers an alternative to the conventional narrative of Abstract Expressionism as a uniquely American genre pioneered by men such as Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. 

“Action, Gesture, Paint” uses pieces loaned by Christian Levett, a British collector, and others to stress the contributions of women. Some, like Lee Krasner, Helen Frankenthaler and Grace Hartigan, have already been highlighted in “Ninth Street Women”, a book by Mary Gabriel. The true novelty of this exhibition is to show that, in the post-war years, artists from Argentina to Japan produced work comparable to that of their American counterparts, celebrating freedom (or protesting against its absence) in bold, colourful, vigorous abstracts.
