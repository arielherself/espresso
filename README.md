Exit polls from <strong>Italy’s election</strong> suggest that a right-wing coalition led by the far-right [Brothers of Italy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/22/giorgia-meloni-and-her-brothers-of-italy-look-set-to-win-the-next-election) party is set to win a majority in both houses of parliament. The party has its roots in neo-fascism. Its leader, Giorgia Meloni, is likely to become the country’s first female prime minister.

Some <strong>Russian</strong> men of fighting age are being banned from leaving the country according to the Telegraph channel of Pavel Chikov, a Russian lawyer. Queues of people attempting to <strong>avoid the draft</strong> have been reported at the country’s borders with Georgia, Kazakhstan and Mongolia. As many as 2,000 people have been arrested for participating in protests against the measures, according to OVD-Info, a human-rights group. Over the weekend Russia launched new strikes on Ukrainian cities while residents in four Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine were coerced into voting in favour of joining Russia.

Thousands of people in <strong>the Philippines</strong> were evacuated from coastal areas as a major typhoon approached. Typhoon Noru made landfall west of Luzon, the archipelago’s main island, with winds of nearly 150mph. In Canada, Storm Fiona hit the country’s east coast, destroying several homes and power lines. And in the Caribbean tropical Storm Ian is forecast on Sunday to strengthen to become a hurricane.

Eliud Kipchoge, a Kenyan runner, broke his own world record for the <strong>fastest marathon</strong>. He finished the 26.2-mile (42.2km) race in Berlin in two hours, one minute and nine seconds, some 30 seconds faster than his previous best. Mr Kipchoge has run the [distance](https://te.arielherself.xyz/game-theory/2019/04/05/the-marathon-has-vanquished-other-long-distance-running-events) in less than two hours before, in 2019, but as it did not take place in an official competition the time was not a world record.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>North Korea</strong> fired a short-range ballistic missile off its east coast, according to South Korea’s army. The launch—the latest in a [flurry of missile tests ](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/02/03/what-is-behind-north-koreas-flurry-of-missile-tests)this year—came just after an American aircraft carrier arrived in South Korea to participate in military drills. South Korea called it an “act of grave provocation”. 

Banks in Lebanon will reopen on Monday, after armed raids by customers demanding access to their savings forced branches to close. The country’s banking association said that banks could reopen despite “the absence of adequate protection by the state”. [Withdrawals have been limited](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/05/07/desperate-lebanese-depositors-are-taking-their-banks-to-court) and deposits frozen for nearly three years amid an economic crisis.

As Britain’s <strong>opposition</strong> Labour Party began its annual party conference Keir Starmer, the party’s leader, told the BBC he would reverse [tax cuts](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically) to the highest earners announced by the Conservative government on Friday. In a different interview, also with the BBC, the new Tory chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, defended the cuts which he says will help Britons at all levels of income.

## Weekend profile: William Kentridge, South African artist

Using just a stick of charcoal and crisp sheet of white paper, [William Kentridge](https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2020/12/09/william-kentridge-contemplates-history-and-creation) tries to make sense of a messy world. Over and over, he traces a line, smudges it a little, rubs it out and traces it anew. His mediums are many, his subjects wide ranging: the Russian revolution; the great colonial wars of the 20th century; the inequities of his native South Africa, first under apartheid and then democratic rule. Doubt, migration and the slipperiness of history are recurring themes.

Aged 67, Mr Kentridge is in the flush of his career—and having a moment. This month “Self-Portrait as a Coffee Pot”, a documentary series chronicling his studio practice, had its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. In London he is involved in three shows. A retrospective at the Royal Academy of Arts, opening on Saturday, is packed to the gunwales with his drawings, sculptures and sets for theatre and opera. Starting on October 6th the Barbican will stage performances, involving music and dance, by South African artists developed at Mr Kentridge’s incubator in Johannesburg. Also next month Goodman Gallery will screen “Oh to Believe in Another World”, a stop-motion film set to Dmitri Shostakovich’s Tenth Symphony.

Shostakovich composed the symphony around the time of Joseph Stalin’s death; its explosive second movement is said to evoke state terror. Mr Kentridge uses marionettes to explore the composer’s attitudes towards Stalin and the Soviet Union. The film resembles a collage. Like much of Mr Kentridge’s work, it implies that history itself is a process of eliding, distorting and stitching things back together.

For the impatient viewer these works may be noisy and confusing. But it’s worth persisting. “One of the hard things to realise”, says Mr Kentridge, “is the edge of who one is, of what your imagination can produce.”

## Italians go to the polls

Italians vote on Sunday in an election whose outcome is as widely expected as it would be dramatic. Polling carried out before a ban took effect on September 10th gave a right-wing alliance almost 46% of the vote. Some 17 points more than the next-biggest coalition, led by a centre-left former prime minister, Enrico Letta, would be enough to give the right a comfortable parliamentary majority. Within that group the [Brothers of Italy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/22/giorgia-meloni-and-her-brothers-of-italy-look-set-to-win-the-next-election), a party that sports the symbol of neo-fascism, is far ahead of its allies. That makes the Brothers’ leader, [Giorgia Meloni](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/22/how-afraid-should-europe-be-of-giorgia-meloni), Italy’s probable next prime minister.

A pressing doubt about the Italian right is its stance on Russia. Ms Meloni’s allies include Silvio Berlusconi, a former prime minister and long-standing friend of Vladimir Putin. On September 22nd, having previously criticised Russia, he said that in invading Ukraine Mr Putin just wanted to replace Volodymyr Zelensky’s government with “decent people”. That is not what NATO and Washington wanted to hear.

## The scandal rocking the chess world

Hans Niemann, a 19-year-old American chess player, is at the centre of a cheating scandal at the heart of the chess world. At the start of September Mr Niemann defeated the world champion, Magnus Carlsen, playing well above his usual level. Then, on Monday, in another match-up between the pair, Mr Carlsen resigned after a single move. Pundits speculated that Mr Carlsen was signalling that he thought that Mr Niemann had cheated in victory.

It is hard to police over-the-board chess matches. In recent years players have been rumbled receiving coded messages from allies in the audience, and using phones in toilets. Mr Niemann has admitted to using computer assistance in online tournaments in his youth, but denied cheating in over-the-board games as an adult. In a chess world that runs on trust, that has damaged his credibility. 

Yet for all that, Mr Carlsen has produced no evidence of wrongdoing. And experts who have parsed Mr Niemann’s performance over the past two years have found little cause for suspicion.

## The CIA launches its first-ever podcast

“I love spy movies,” says [William Burns](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2021/01/11/for-the-first-time-a-career-diplomat-is-to-lead-the-cia), the director of the CIA. But reality is a comedown. “For me, at least, the height of technological daring is when I can finally get the Roku remote to work at home,” he admits on the first episode of “The Langley Files”—a podcast launched this week to commemorate the intelligence agency’s 75th anniversary. It is the latest sign that the spooks are coming out of the shadows. In 2019, the CIA made its Instagram debut; in 2020, the agency began advertising on video-streaming services.

The main reason for this is recruitment. Like many white-collar workplaces, spy agencies have realised that their needs have become more specialised: they seek Mandarin speakers and cryptographers (and ideally both). For that, traditional shoulder-tap routines fall short. The CIA hopes that forays like podcasts will entice prospective recruits. Listeners, though, may discover, like the director, that [modern spycraft](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2020/02/22/spies-often-use-businesses-as-cover) is a lot more humdrum than movies tend to suggest.

## Cuba votes on a new family code

On Sunday Cubans will vote on whether to update the family laws of a country where social freedoms have long outpaced political ones. The government’s proposed code is progressive: it would legalise marriage and civil unions for same-sex couples, and allow them to adopt children. Surrogacy and prenuptial agreements would be legalised. The new code also suggests extending parental rights beyond biological parents.

But some religious Cubans are likely to oppose the changes. Others see the referendum, the country’s fourth since its revolution in 1959, as a distraction from more pressing issues. The island of 11m is in a severe economic crisis, suffering [shortages of food](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2021/07/01/cuba-is-facing-its-worst-shortage-of-food-since-the-1990s) and medicine. Cubans are emigrating in record numbers. The government’s response has been a mixture of inadequate—giving the private sector a tiny bit more freedom—and repressive, as it clamps down on dissent that has simmered since [large protests](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2021/07/15/the-cuban-government-cracks-down-on-protesters) erupted in July last year. Cubans can surely think of many other laws that need changing.
