The government of Mario Draghi, **Italy’s** prime minister, unravelled on Wednesday as the leaders of two right-wing parties in his coalition sat out a confidence vote in his government. Mr Draghi won the vote 95-38, but it was a hollow victory given the boycotts. Silvio Berlusconi, of Forza Italia, and Matteo Salvini, of the Northern League, had demanded the [exclusion of the populist Five Star Movement](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/14/mario-draghi-italys-prime-minister-tries-and-fails-to-resign) from the governing coalition—a condition Mr Draghi refused to accept. He is expected to submit his resignation on Thursday, a move likely to precipitate early elections.

 **Russia’s** foreign minister, [Sergei Lavrov](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/02/12/the-beastly-history-of-diplomatic-insults), said that its **objectives** in Ukraine now go beyond the eastern [Donbas](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/02/15/why-donetsk-and-luhansk-are-at-the-heart-of-the-ukraine-crisis) region, a sign that Russia is expanding its war goals. Mr Lavrov told RIA Novosti, a state broadcaster, that Russia’s targets now include not only the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, in the east, but also Kherson and [Zaporizhzhia](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/03/04/europes-largest-nuclear-plant-shuts-down-after-a-russian-attack) in the south. On Tuesday American officials warned that Russia was adopting an “annexation playbook” in occupied areas.

President **Joe Biden** announced various climate-related executive actions, days after his proposed **climate** legislation ran aground in Congress. One directive promotes offshore wind development in the Gulf of Mexico, historically a site of oil-and-gas drilling, and in waters along America’s south-eastern coast. But Mr Biden stopped short of declaring a national climate-change emergency, as some activists had hoped. Such a decree would make more federal money available for mitigation efforts.

 **Tesla’s** second-quarter profit declined from the first three months of the year, owing to [covid-related shutdowns](https://www.economist.com/business/what-shanghai-lockdowns-mean-for-china-inc/21808450) at its Shanghai factory and a parts shortage. The carmaker recorded revenues of $16.9bn. Net income was $2.3bn—nearly double its profit in the same period last year, but short of the record $3.3bn booked last quarter. Tesla aims to produce more than 1.5m vehicles this year, up by 60% from 2021.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

The **European Commission** urged member countries to cut **gas** usage by 15% amid fears of reduced supply from Russia. The emergency plan, comes after Vladimir Putin said that when **Gazprom** restarts supplies to Europe via the **Nord Stream 1** pipeline on Thursday, it will be at a drastically reduced capacity. Officially the pipeline is closed for maintenance. Some suspect Russia is manipulating gas flows as a [political tool](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter) in retaliation for the EU’s support of Ukraine.

**Ukraine** will ask international bondholders for a delay of two years in making its **debt repayments​​** **—** so it can put the money towards its defence against Russia. The Ukrainian government hopes to negotiate the deferral by the middle of August, before some $1.2bn of debt payments are due in early September. Ukraine’s GDP has fallen by an estimated 40% since Russia invaded in February. 

**Rishi Sunak** and **Liz Truss** made it through to the final round of **Britain’s** Conservative [leadership race](https://www.economist.com/interactive/next-prime-minister-uk); **Penny Mordaunt** was eliminated. The winner will replace Boris Johnson as prime minister. Ms Mordaunt received only 105 votes from Conservative MPs on Wednesday. Ms Truss, the foreign secretary, received 113 supporters; Mr Sunak, a former chancellor, led with 137. The final two candidates will now [face a ballot](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/07/how-does-britains-conservative-party-choose-a-new-leader) of approximately 180,000 Conservative Party members, with the result expected on September 5th.

## Draghi’s decision day

Italy’s prime minister went before the Italian Senate on Wednesday, seeking a vote of confidence for his divided government. Mario Draghi [tried to resign](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/14/mario-draghi-italys-prime-minister-tries-and-fails-to-resign) last week after the Five Star Movement (M5S), the second biggest party in his coalition, failed to back him in a previous confidence vote. But Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, refused the resignation and told him to test his support in parliament instead.

Mr Draghi’s message was, in essence, “take me or leave me”. But he offered some concessions to M5S, though their senators did not applaud his speech. And he left open the option of a new government under his leadership. What remains to be seen is whether the right-wing parties in his coalition try to force a snap election and join the far-right Brothers of Italy, currently in opposition, in an electoral alliance. (Polls suggest that would be a winning combination.) As the parties make their plans clear over the course of the day, Mr Draghi will have to decide whether to go or stay.

## Sri Lanka’s dispiriting presidential vote

It has been yet another turbulent week in Sri Lanka. On July 13th Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the country’s president, [furtively bolted](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/13/sri-lankas-president-flees-leaving-the-country-in-chaos) to the Maldives, dispatching his resignation from Singapore the following day. On Wednesday the Sri Lankan parliament voted to choose his replacement, overwhelmingly opting for Ranil Wickremesinghe, the current acting president. 

Yet Mr Wickremesinghe, a six-time prime minister, is profoundly unpopular with the public. He is seen as an ally of Mr Rajapaksa; his house was burnt down amid the violent protests that triggered the president’s flight.

His election will irk already fed up Sri Lankans. Mr Rajapaksa left a [country in turmoil](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/19/why-is-sri-lanka-in-turmoil). His economic mismanagement has left people desperately short of fuel, food and medicines. With virtually no foreign-currency reserves, and negotiations over an urgent IMF bail-out not yet concluded, Sri Lanka is [crying out](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/05/14/sri-lanka-has-no-money-and-no-government-what-now) for decent leadership. Upon his election, Mr Wickremesinghe urged political unity to get the country out of its mess. But that will be easier said than done.

## Britain’s wannabe-leaders face up to inflation

On Wednesday, the three candidates to lead Britain’s Conservative Party will be whittled down to a final two. Party members will then [choose](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/07/how-does-britains-conservative-party-choose-a-new-leader) Boris Johnson’s successor as Tory leader and prime minister. But as inflation figures also released on Wednesday showed, Britain’s next leader will inherit extraordinary challenges. Prices rose by an annual rate of 9.4% in June, faster than expected and up from 9.1% in May.

The candidates have plans to help stretched wallets. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, wants closer scrutiny of the Bank of England, as well as tax cuts. [Penny Mordaunt](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/15/who-is-penny-mordaunt) also favours lowering the tax bill. But Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, would cut taxes only once inflation has fallen. He likens his rivals’ plans to “a fairy tale”.

There may be grounds to help the neediest, but tax cuts are probably [not the answer](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/13/britains-conservatives-seem-oblivious-to-the-coming-budget-crunch). If the higher consumer spending that would result pushes up inflation further, the Bank of England will tighten monetary policy, pinching borrowers. Taxes may be unpopular, but when fighting inflation there are few happy endings.

## Tesla’s bump in the road

In recent years Tesla, Elon Musk’s pioneering electric-car maker, has been the [darling of the industry](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/06/02/the-electric-vehicle-revolution-is-not-happening-fast-enough). Results in April showed the company’s revenue grew some 81% year-on-year, to around $18.8bn. But Tesla’s latest numbers, due on Wednesday, will be less cheery.

The company delivered just 254,000 cars in the second quarter of 2022, well below the 310,000 shipped in the first. The dip is largely the result of covid-19 lockdowns in Shanghai; these forced the temporary closure of [Tesla’s factory](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/04/29/the-magical-realism-of-tesla) in the city, typically its most productive. 

But the firm has other problems, too. It may have lost $360m on a $1.5bn investment in bitcoin, which has crashed. And sales from competitors such as BYD, a Chinese firm, are quickly growing. Yet instead of focusing on cars Mr Musk is distracted by [legal battles](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/11/with-or-without-elon-musk-twitter-is-overdue-a-shake-up) over his rescinded bid to buy Twitter. For Tesla, the ride ahead does not look smooth.

## The hidden joys of “Mario Paint”

It was not like most video games. There are no quests, storylines or villains to be defeated. When it was released for Nintendo’s Super Entertainment System in July 1992, “Mario Paint” challenged gamers to design rather than destroy. And it succeeded in turning the making of digital art into a [joyous experience](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/07/14/mario-paint-inspired-a-generation-of-creative-geeks).

What the game lacked in sophistication—players could paint with just 15 colours—it made up for with charm. Each stroke of a brush was accompanied by a bouncy sound effect. The cursor rotated through the colours of the rainbow. And, importantly, the game had the capacity to create animations and compose music. When digital animation became commonplace on the internet, some web-series pioneers cited “Mario Paint” as their inspiration.

Thirty years later, some people are still loyal. Websites offer recreations of the game’s “composer” mode, and several imitation programs are available. The appeal is, perhaps, its whimsy. Modern digital-art software is professional, clean and utilitarian. “Mario Paint” made drawing on a computer fun instead.
