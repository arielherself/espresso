The death toll from a Russian <strong>missile strike</strong> on an apartment building in Dnipro, a Ukrainian city, climbed to 40, according to local officials. The strike prompted Western pledges of [more heavy weapons](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/01/06/the-west-sends-armoured-fighting-vehicles-to-ukraine) for the embattled country. Meanwhile <strong>Belarus</strong> and <strong>Russia</strong> began “purely defensive” joint air-force drills on Monday—raising Ukraine’s fears that the Kremlin plans to launch a new [ground offensive](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/12/15/a-looming-russian-offensive) from Belarus.

White House officials said that visitor logs tracking guests to <strong>President Joe Biden’s</strong> home in Delaware do not exist. The <strong>Republican</strong> chairman of<strong> America’s</strong> House Oversight Committee, a congressional investigative body, had earlier demanded to see such logs after [classified documents](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2023/01/13/joe-bidens-documents-mess) were revealed to have been found there. Republicans accuse Democrats—who have insisted that Donald Trump should be prosecuted for mishandling sensitive papers—of hypocrisy. 

Christine Lambrecht, <strong>Germany’s defence minister</strong>, announced her resignation after much criticism over a message she posted on social media on New Year’s Eve. In the video—shot with fireworks in the background—she said for her the war in Ukraine was associated with “many encounters with interesting, great people.” Ms Lambrecht, a [member of the ruling](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/12/07/germanys-ruling-coalition-marks-its-first-anniversary) Social Democratic Party, is also blamed for mismanaging army reforms.

Britain’s government announced it will block a [controversial <strong>Scottish</strong> <strong>law</strong>](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2023/01/05/scotlands-new-gender-reform-law-presents-rishi-sunak-with-a-dilemma) that streamlines the process for people in Scotland to change their legal <strong>gender</strong>. The move marks the first time Britain has overruled legislation passed by the Scottish parliament, which it can do if Scottish laws conflict with powers “reserved” for Westminster. Scottish nationalists swiftly criticised the decision—though the gender law is divisive in Scotland, too.

<strong>Matteo Messina Denaro</strong>, a notorious Italian <strong>mafia</strong> boss, has been arrested after 30 years on the run. Mr Denaro was sentenced to a life sentence in absentia for several murders, including the killing of two prominent anti-mafia prosecutors, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, in 1992. Giorgia Meloni, Italy’s Prime Minister, called his arrest “a great victory for the state”.

Police in <strong>Nepal </strong>said it is “unlikely” that anyone survived after an <strong>aeroplane crashed</strong> near the town of Pokhara. There were 72 people on board and 69 people have been confirmed dead so far. It is thought to be the country’s deadliest air crash since 1992. The EU has banned Nepali airlines from its airspace since 2013 because of safety concerns.

<strong>Real-estate</strong> transactions in <strong>Dubai </strong>were worth more than a record $143bn in 2022, as the total number of units sold increased by over 60%, according to Betterhomes, a local consultancy. The surge was fuelled in part by [Russian](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/09/22/dubai-is-the-worlds-resurgent-entrepot) interest: facing [Western sanctions](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/08/25/are-sanctions-working), they were last year the emirate&#x27;s biggest foreign buyers, up from its eighth-largest in 2021. Real estate accounts for about a third of Dubai’s economy.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 1.5bn, the number of grandparents in the world. There were 0.5bn in 1960; the ratio of grandparents to children is now higher than ever. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2023/01/12/the-age-of-the-grandparent-has-arrived).

## Why Davos is not as silly as it seems

On Monday more than 2,500 of the world’s movers and shakers arrive in Davos for the World Economic Forum. The annual week-long gabfest in the Swiss Alps returns to regular programming for the first time since the pandemic began; 2022’s edition took place in May rather than in January because of the Omicron variant of covid-19. After a freakishly warm winter, some snow is back at last—as are high-powered globalists, many of whom stayed away last spring. The preoccupations have not changed much: war, covid-19 (this time [in China](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2023/01/10/covid-is-complicating-chinas-efforts-to-re-engage-with-the-world)), inflation and recession.

Davos is [easy to mock](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/05/26/is-this-the-end-of-davos-man). Pampered insiders pontificate on the fate of billions of less fortunate folk. The panel sessions on fixing globalisation, averting a climate catastrophe or fostering inclusive growth can be excruciating in their blandness. Yet outside the formal events Davos provides a neutral venue for frank talks: between the worlds of politics and business, the global south and north, East and West. In an increasingly fragmented world, such exchanges are valuable.

## Europe divides the spoils of warm weather

The Eurogroup, the regular informal gathering of the euro zone’s finance ministers, will need an extra chair when it meets in Brussels on Monday. Croatia became its 20th member after adopting the euro on January 1st. The bloc has more good news to celebrate, too. The [heat wave after Christmas](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2023/01/12/europes-freakish-winter-heatwave-breaks-records) caused a steep fall in energy prices. That in turn means that finance ministers will have to spend a lot less on cutting the energy bills of firms and households.

What to do with that windfall? One option is to spend it protecting European business from the [effects of America’s Inflation Reduction Act](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/12/08/europe-and-america-put-a-brave-face-on-a-growing-economic-rift), a green investment programme with troubling protectionist elements. Margrethe Vestaegar, the EU’s competition chief, is championing the idea. Ahead of their meeting she sent the Eurogroup a letter calling for urgent reforms to the rules governing state aid. Such changes might allow firms tempted by America’s subsidies to get money for staying put. If finance ministers agree, that could kick off a transatlantic subsidy race.

## Britain’s migration plan returns to court

On Monday judges on Britain’s High Court gave permission for an appeal to be made against their previous ruling about a controversial migration policy. The plan allows the British government to deport migrants who arrive without visas, including those crossing the English Channel in dinghies, to Rwanda. Despite the same court ruling in December that the policy was lawful, they will now allow a group of charities and asylum seekers to launch a legal challenge. They are arguing that the original ruling fails to give people facing deportation their procedural rights. 

The policy is [politically divisive](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/11/02/why-small-boats-are-a-big-problem-for-britain): it delights many of the Conservative government’s supporters and horrifies its critics. (Suella Braverman, the home secretary, has described it as her “dream” and “obsession”.) The first planned deportation flight to Rwanda in June was blocked by the European Court of Human Rights. The government does not mind the controversy. A prolonged fight with do-gooding lawyers in the courts could bolster support for it. Others see a policy that generates headlines but violates migrants’ rights without curbing irregular migration. 

## Russia reshuffles its command in Ukraine

As Valery Gerasimov, Russia’s top general, begins his full first week in command of the invasion of Ukraine, he may wonder if his tenure will prove fleeting. His predecessor, [Sergei Surovikin](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/13/who-is-sergei-surovikin-russias-new-commander-in-ukraine), lasted just three months. President Vladimir Putin’s decision to shuffle the pack was probably political rather than strategic. General Surovikin, now demoted to be one of General Gerasimov’s deputies, is favoured by [Yevgeny Prigozhin](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/29/who-is-yevgeny-prigozhin-the-man-behind-the-wagner-group), the shadowy head of the Wagner group of mercenaries who have become increasingly influential [on the battlefield](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/01/04/a-russian-warlords-savagery-is-sending-a-loud-message-to-moscow). Military leaders not aligned with Mr Prigozhin, such as General Gerasimov, have been lobbying Mr Putin to put them back in control.

Military analysts suspect the new leadership will lay the groundwork for a new offensive. Mr Putin will expect results. For its part, Ukraine argues the looming threat means it needs more weapons, [including tanks](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/01/11/the-west-should-supply-tanks-to-ukraine), from the West. Its allies will meet to discuss arms deliveries in Germany on Friday.

## More love on “Love Island”

Beneath its glossy, suntanned veneer, “[Love Island](https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2019/06/19/love-islands-literary-forebears-from-eden-to-the-tempest)”, a British dating show, has a dark side. Filmed constantly while locked in a luxury villa, scantily-clad contestants spend weeks without clocks, internet, mobile phones—or privacy. Ten share a bedroom. The aim is to couple up; the viewers’ favourite pair win a cash prize. But bullying is rampant. For every contestant who finds fame and fortune, another meets a barrage of abuse on social media. Two past contestants and a former presenter committed suicide.

The show [thrives on drama](https://te.arielherself.xyz/prospero/2018/07/31/why-do-people-love-love-island). But for its ninth season, which begins on Monday, producers have promised to do more to protect the islanders’ mental health. Contestants will receive training on respect. To limit trolling opportunities they will have to turn off their social-media accounts while inside (previously these were run by friends and family on the outside). Whether the show’s ratings will survive the new protocols will depend on the viewers’ appetite for healthy relationships over dysfunctional ones.
