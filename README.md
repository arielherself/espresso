 **Vladimir Putin** told reporters that **Gazprom** will restart gas supplies to Europe via the **Nord Stream 1** pipeline on schedule, on Thursday—but at a drastically reduced capacity. Officially the pipeline is closed for maintenance. Some suspect Russia is manipulating gas flows as a [political tool](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter) in retaliation for the EU’s support of Ukraine. Mr Putin’s remarks offered them no comfort, despite his insisting that Gazprom will fulfil its commitments.

 **Britain** recorded **temperatures** of more than 40°C for the first time on Tuesday, with the freakish heat straining fire departments and other public services. [Extremely high temperatures](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/19/the-increase-in-simultaneous-heatwaves) were recorded across Europe. Huge [wildfires](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/07/18/how-bad-are-europes-wildfires) have flashed across the continent in recent days, with tens of thousands of people fleeing homes in France. Portugal reported more than 1,000 heatwave-related deaths.

 **America’s** House of Representatives passed a bill protecting the right to **same-sex and interracial marriages** . All 220 House Democrats voted in favour, as did 47 Republicans. But Republican opposition in the Senate means that the bill is not expected to pass. While overturning the [right to abortion](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/06/24/the-supreme-courts-rejection-of-roe-will-hurt-the-poorest-most) last month, one of the justices on the Supreme Court had argued that the right to gay marriage should also be reconsidered.

Regulators in **China** are reportedly preparing to fine **Didi** , a ride-hailing company, $1bn for data breaches. The fine amounts to about 5% of the firm’s revenue in 2021 and would end a months-long investigation into the firm’s cyber-security practices. Didi has [struggled](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/06/09/the-communist-party-resuscitates-didi-global) ever since it angered Chinese regulators by listing on the New York stock exchange last year despite being told not to do so. 

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

A Delaware judge set an October start date in the trial between **Elon Musk** and **Twitter** , rejecting Mr Musk’s bid to hold it next year. A long delay, and the uncertainty around the deal, harms Twitter “every hour of every day”, argued its lawyers. The social-media firm sued Mr Musk after he sought to [abandon his agreement to buy it](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/11/with-or-without-elon-musk-twitter-is-overdue-a-shake-up) for $44bn.

 **Netflix** shed 970,000 paid subscribers in the three months ending in June. The drop marked its [second consecutive quarterly decline](https://www.economist.com/business/netflix-sheds-subscribers-and-170bn-in-market-value/21808847), although it was less drastic than the 2m loss the firm had forecast. Revenues grew by 9% year on year, to nearly $8bn. The streaming firm said it would probably add 1m new subscribers in the next quarter. It plans to offer a cheaper ad-supported tier in a handful of countries starting next year.

Officials in **Australia** urged businesses to let people work from home and recommended mask-wearing indoors amid a major outbreak of **covid-19** . About 50,000 cases were reported on Tuesday, the highest tally in two months. The winter Omicron wave is overwhelming [the health-care system](https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/08/28/australia-is-ending-its-zero-covid-strategy); the number of people in hospital is at record-highs in several parts of the country.

 **Fact of the day:** 45%, the decline of the Sri Lankan rupee against the dollar since March. [Read the full article](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/19/why-is-sri-lanka-in-turmoil).

## Draghi’s decision day

Italy’s prime minister went before the Italian Senate on Wednesday, seeking a vote of confidence for his divided government. Mario Draghi [tried to resign](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/14/mario-draghi-italys-prime-minister-tries-and-fails-to-resign) last week after the Five Star Movement (M5S), the second biggest party in his coalition, failed to back him in a previous confidence vote. But Italy’s president, Sergio Mattarella, refused the resignation and told him to test his support in parliament instead.

Mr Draghi’s message was, in essence, “take me or leave me”. But he offered some concessions to M5S, though their senators did not applaud his speech. And he left open the option of a new government under his leadership. What remains to be seen is whether the right-wing parties in his coalition try to force a snap election and join the far-right Brothers of Italy, currently in opposition, in an electoral alliance. (Polls suggest that would be a winning combination.) As the parties make their plans clear over the course of the day, Mr Draghi will have to decide whether to go or stay.

## Sri Lanka’s dispiriting presidential vote

It has been yet another turbulent week in Sri Lanka. On July 13th Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the country’s president, [furtively bolted](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/13/sri-lankas-president-flees-leaving-the-country-in-chaos) to the Maldives, dispatching his resignation from Singapore the following day. On Wednesday the Sri Lankan parliament voted to choose his replacement, overwhelmingly opting for Ranil Wickremesinghe, the current acting president. 

Yet Mr Wickremesinghe, a six-time prime minister, is profoundly unpopular with the public. He is seen as an ally of Mr Rajapaksa; his house was burnt down amid the violent protests that triggered the president’s flight.

His election will irk already fed up Sri Lankans. Mr Rajapaksa left a [country in turmoil](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/19/why-is-sri-lanka-in-turmoil). His economic mismanagement has left people desperately short of fuel, food and medicines. With virtually no foreign-currency reserves, and negotiations over an urgent IMF bail-out not yet concluded, Sri Lanka is [crying out](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/05/14/sri-lanka-has-no-money-and-no-government-what-now) for decent leadership. Upon his election, Mr Wickremesinghe urged political unity to get the country out of its mess. But that will be easier said than done.

## Britain’s wannabe-leaders face up to inflation

On Wednesday, the three candidates to lead Britain’s Conservative Party will be whittled down to a final two. Party members will then [choose](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/07/how-does-britains-conservative-party-choose-a-new-leader) Boris Johnson’s successor as Tory leader and prime minister. But as inflation figures also released on Wednesday showed, Britain’s next leader will inherit extraordinary challenges. Prices rose by an annual rate of 9.4% in June, faster than expected and up from 9.1% in May.

The candidates have plans to help stretched wallets. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, wants closer scrutiny of the Bank of England, as well as tax cuts. [Penny Mordaunt](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/15/who-is-penny-mordaunt) also favours lowering the tax bill. But Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, would cut taxes only once inflation has fallen. He likens his rivals’ plans to “a fairy tale”.

There may be grounds to help the neediest, but tax cuts are probably [not the answer](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/13/britains-conservatives-seem-oblivious-to-the-coming-budget-crunch). If the higher consumer spending that would result pushes up inflation further, the Bank of England will tighten monetary policy, pinching borrowers. Taxes may be unpopular, but when fighting inflation there are few happy endings.

## Tesla’s bump in the road

In recent years Tesla, Elon Musk’s pioneering electric-car maker, has been the [darling of the industry](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/06/02/the-electric-vehicle-revolution-is-not-happening-fast-enough). Results in April showed the company’s revenue grew some 81% year-on-year, to around $18.8bn. But Tesla’s latest numbers, due on Wednesday, will be less cheery.

The company delivered just 254,000 cars in the second quarter of 2022, well below the 310,000 shipped in the first. The dip is largely the result of covid-19 lockdowns in Shanghai; these forced the temporary closure of [Tesla’s factory](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/04/29/the-magical-realism-of-tesla) in the city, typically its most productive. 

But the firm has other problems, too. It may have lost $360m on a $1.5bn investment in bitcoin, which has crashed. And sales from competitors such as BYD, a Chinese firm, are quickly growing. Yet instead of focusing on cars Mr Musk is distracted by [legal battles](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/11/with-or-without-elon-musk-twitter-is-overdue-a-shake-up) over his rescinded bid to buy Twitter. For Tesla, the ride ahead does not look smooth.

## The hidden joys of “Mario Paint”

It was not like most video games. There are no quests, storylines or villains to be defeated. When it was released for Nintendo’s Super Entertainment System in July 1992, “Mario Paint” challenged gamers to design rather than destroy. And it succeeded in turning the making of digital art into a [joyous experience](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/07/14/mario-paint-inspired-a-generation-of-creative-geeks).

What the game lacked in sophistication—players could paint with just 15 colours—it made up for with charm. Each stroke of a brush was accompanied by a bouncy sound effect. The cursor rotated through the colours of the rainbow. And, importantly, the game had the capacity to create animations and compose music. When digital animation became commonplace on the internet, some web-series pioneers cited “Mario Paint” as their inspiration.

Thirty years later, some people are still loyal. Websites offer recreations of the game’s “composer” mode, and several imitation programs are available. The appeal is, perhaps, its whimsy. Modern digital-art software is professional, clean and utilitarian. “Mario Paint” made drawing on a computer fun instead.
