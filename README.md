Ukraine’s president, <strong>Volodymyr Zelensky</strong>, addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, asking the West to supply more [arms](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/01/11/the-west-should-supply-tanks-to-ukraine) and asking world leaders to respond to Russia “with speed”. Mr Zelensky’s speech came hours after his interior minister, Denys Monastyrksy, and more than a dozen other people were killed when a helicopter [crashed](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/01/18/a-helicopter-crash-has-dealt-a-heavy-blow-to-ukraines-government) outside Kyiv, the capital.

<strong>America’s</strong> treasury secretary, [Janet Yellen](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/11/03/two-new-biographies-explore-the-rise-and-reign-of-janet-yellen), met <strong>China’s</strong> vice-premier and economic tsar, [Liu He](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/09/29/who-will-be-chinas-next-economic-tsar), for the first time, in Zurich. The American treasury said that the pair had a “candid” conversation, agreeing that [better communication](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/11/17/america-and-china-try-to-get-along) between their governments would be beneficial to the global economy. Before the meeting Ms Yellen remarked that their countries shared a responsibility to “manage our differences”.

<strong>Microsoft</strong> has announced that it will cut 10,000 jobs, or around 5% of its global workforce. Redundancies will cost the firm around $1.2bn. <strong>Amazon</strong> is also expected to cut 6% of its workforce today. Other [tech firms](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/11/10/as-tech-lay-offs-spread-meta-sacks-11000-workers) have also reduced the size of their workforce in response to signs of a slowing economy.

<strong>American prosecutors</strong> charged a founder of Bitzlato, a <strong>crypto exchange</strong> registered in Hong Kong, with operating an illegal money-transmitting business. Anatoly Legkodymov, a Russian national living in China, was arrested in Miami. French authorities shut down the platform’s website and seized its cryptocurrency. Bitzlato allegedly helped launder $700m on behalf of criminals.

<strong>Israel’s </strong>Supreme Court ruled against the appointment of Aryeh Deri, a close ally of the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, to a senior minister position. The court decried Mr Deri’s appointment as unreasonable given his previous conviction for tax fraud. The decision is a blow to Mr Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition and signals [rising tensions](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2023/01/16/netanyahu-rushes-to-take-on-israels-supreme-court) between it and Israel’s independent judiciary.

Members of the <strong>European Parliament</strong> elected Marc Angel, an MEP from Luxembourg, to replace Eva Kaili, a disgraced MEP from Greece, as vice-president. Mr Angel, a member of the Socialists and Democrats group, won a majority of votes cast. Ms Kaili, who was at the [centre of a corruption scandal](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/12/15/a-corruption-scandal-leaves-the-eu-reeling) allegedly involving Qatar, was arrested by Belgian police in December.

Lucile Randon, thought to be the <strong>world’s oldest person</strong>, died at the age of 118. A French nun known as Sister André, she entered a convent in 1944 and lived through two world wars and the reigns of ten [popes](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2023/01/02/the-death-of-pope-benedict-removes-a-problem-for-liberal-catholics). Sister André enjoyed a daily glass of wine but when asked the secret to a long life insisted “only God can answer that question”.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 37%, the proportion of Brazilians in favour of a coup to remove President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, according to one poll. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/01/12/how-brazil-should-deal-with-the-bolsonarista-insurrection).

## Japanese monetary policy stands pat

The Bank of Japan kept its ultra-loose policy framework intact at its board meeting today, sending the yen sliding against the dollar. Markets had been bracing for another surprise after the central bank [shocked observers in December](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/12/20/the-bank-of-japan-shocks-investors) by widening the band for ten-year bond yields under its yield-curve control (YCC) policy. Yields had risen to the new upper limit of 0.5% in recent weeks, as investors tested the new target.

But instead of tweaking the YCC framework again or abandoning it altogether, the BoJ doubled down on defending it. Kuroda Haruhiko, the governor, has claimed the December change was only intended to improve the functionality of bond markets. The BoJ still reckons Japanese inflation is not sustainably high enough to warrant tightening policy. Nonetheless, speculation about policy normalisation is rife. Many expect the central bank will move further after the term after Mr Kuroda’s term ends in April.

## Sergei Lavrov talks up Russia’s achievements

Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, held his annual press conference on Wednesday. It was a chance for the veteran diplomat to summarise what his spokesman calls the country’s “main foreign policy results” over the last year. Given Russia’s [faltering invasion of Ukraine](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/01/16/a-russian-town-counts-the-cost-of-vladimir-putins-war), observers may wonder if there was much to boast about. But Mr Lavrov was not daunted. He used the conference to discuss the Kremlin’s favourite subject: why the treacherous West, not Russia, is to blame for Europe’s ills. 

Yet beneath the rhetoric Mr Lavrov must be aware of the rising costs of Russia’s international isolation. The country’s influence in its own backyard, the south Caucasus and Central Asia, has diminished. Leaders from traditionally friendly powers in Asia, namely China and India, have made barbed comments about the effects of Russia’s folly. And far from backing down, NATO looks set to add Finland and Sweden to its membership. In truth, Russia’s leaders only have themselves to blame.

## More knocks for the NHS

Britain’s [National Health Service](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2023/01/15/why-health-care-services-are-in-chaos-everywhere) is once more breaking records, for all the wrong reasons. In December people who suffered a medical emergency such as a suspected heart attack waited an average of 93 minutes for an ambulance (the target is 18 minutes). Over 54,000 people waited more than 12 hours to be admitted to hospital even after the decision to admit them had been made. The NHS is often accused of being “in crisis”, but this is a particularly terrible winter.

Staff have had enough. On Wednesday nurses began their second round of strikes, with further action planned in February. Ambulance workers will walk out on January 23rd; physiotherapists three days later (when their ballot closes on Thursday, junior doctors, too, will probably follow suit). The disputes will only be resolved with better pay, and that might also make a dent in the NHS’s biggest problem: staffing levels. Almost one in ten posts are vacant. That is one reason why an unprecedented 7m people are waiting for specialist treatment. 

## Trouble in the Amazon

Starting on Wednesday Amazon, America’s second-largest private employer, will begin laying off over 18,000 of its 300,000-odd white-collar workforce, largely from its e-commerce and human resources divisions. The online-shopping giant’s jobs cuts are part of a broader [white-collar recession](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/12/04/is-a-white-collar-recession-looming) that caused America’s tech companies to announce 150,000 lay-offs in 2022, according to Layoffs.fyi, a website tracking redundancies. This year may turn out to be even worse.

Rising interest rates have especially hurt [tech stocks](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/12/24/how-techs-defiance-of-economic-gravity-came-to-an-abrupt-end). Amazon has struggled to gain market share [internationally](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/06/16/amazon-has-a-rest-of-the-world-problem) and has been forced to slow down its roll-out of bricks-and-mortar stores. 

Not everything is doom and gloom, however. Amazon’s [cloud offering](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/08/29/the-cloud-computing-giants-are-vying-to-protect-fat-profits) continues to dominate the market compared to Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, its two main competitors. And starting on January 31st, Amazon will widen its “Buy with Prime” service, which allows online stores to take advantage of Amazon’s payment and delivery services, a way to fend off growing competition from Canada’s Shopify. It’s about time.

## A rom-com in 140 words

How would you use language if you had a daily word limit equivalent to the length of an Espresso article? That’s the concept behind Sam Steiner’s “Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons Lemons”, a dystopian [romantic comedy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/02/14/a-new-oral-history-of-the-modern-romantic-comedy) about a couple navigating love, work and dissent in a society that restricts them to just 140 words a day. Originally staged in 2015, a new production opens on Wednesday in London. 

The play was Mr Steiner’s breakthrough work, staged when he was just 21 years old. “Lemons” has since been translated into over a dozen languages, and its enduring popularity reflects how it speaks to different cultures. “Initially people thought it was about social media, later about austerity,” Mr Steiner remembers. This time he says “people’s minds may be drawn to how the pandemic changed the way we interact both personally and politically.” Word limit reached.
