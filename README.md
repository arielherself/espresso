Lawmakers in <strong>Peru</strong> voted 101-6 to oust [Pedro Castillo](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/09/29/peru-has-an-incompetent-president-and-a-discredited-congress) as president shortly after he tried to dissolve Congress. He was detained by police and replaced by his vice-president, Dina Boluarte. Earlier, in an attempt to evade impeachment, Mr Castillo had said he would disband the legislature and rule by emergency decree. An [inept leftist](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/07/28/peru-is-becoming-ever-more-volatile-under-pedro-castillo), he cycled through more than 70 ministers in his government and figures in five criminal probes.

<strong>German</strong> police arrested 25 alleged members and supporters of a <strong>far-right terrorist group</strong> on suspicion of plotting to overthrow the country’s government. The group, which included one active [soldier](https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2022/10/21/how-right-wing-extremists-infiltrated-germanys-armed-forces) and several reservists, planned to storm the German parliament and seize power in a violent coup, according to the prosecutor’s office. Police carried out 130 related searches across Germany on Wednesday morning.

The <strong>Taliban</strong> staged the first [public execution](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/12/05/life-under-the-taliban-has-hit-rock-bottom), in a crowded sports stadium in the south-west of Afghanistan, since taking power last year. A father shot the man convicted of murdering his son. The government’s spokesman said the decision to carry out the punishment had been made “very carefully”. America said it marked a “return to their regressive and abusive practices of the 1990s”.

<strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> logged a budget surplus of $27bn, or 2.6% of GDP, in 2022 as it [benefited from elevated oil prices](https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/briefing/2022/09/24/war-in-ukraine-has-reshaped-worlds-fuel-markets). Preliminary figures suggest the kingdom’s economy will grow by 8.5% this year, said the finance ministry, beating the IMF’s prediction by about one percentage point. By contrast global GDP is forecast to expand by 3.2% in 2022.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Russian forces </strong>killed at least <strong>441 civilians</strong> during the early weeks of the war in Ukraine and may have committed [war crimes](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/04/04/how-if-at-all-might-russia-be-punished-for-its-war-crimes-in-ukraine), said the UN’s human rights office, though the civilian death toll is probably much higher. The organisation gathered evidence from 102 towns and villages near the capital, Kyiv, and in the northern regions of Chernihiv and Sumy between February 24th and early April.

<strong>Britain</strong> approved its first <strong>coal mine</strong> in 30 years. The proposed site, in north-west England, will produce coking coal for use in steelmaking. The project’s backers say there is domestic demand for the stuff, but the two firms making steel with coal in England have plans to adopt cleaner methods. Earlier the government’s climate-change adviser called the plan “[absolutely indefensible](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2021/02/15/how-britain-decarbonised-faster-than-any-other-rich-country)”.

<strong>India’s</strong> central bank raised its key <strong>interest rate</strong> by 35 basis points to 6.25% in a further bid to restrain inflation; it is the fifth such hike since May. Retail inflation is currently running at almost 7%, well above the bank’s target. The bank also lowered the country’s [growth](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/05/14/india-is-likely-to-be-the-worlds-fastest-growing-big-economy-this-year) forecast for this financial year from 7% to 6.8%.

## Who can regulate federal elections in America?

On Wednesday the [Supreme Court](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/29/what-to-expect-from-the-new-scotus-term) considers a novel idea that could upend the way America conducts elections. According to proponents of the controversial “independent state legislature theory”, state lawmakers should have near-absolute authority (limited only by Congress) to regulate federal elections—from drawing districts to setting voting hours. Currently state courts can weigh in on, and block, such rules.

<em>Moore v Harper </em>arises from a struggle over a strikingly gerrymandered congressional map drawn by Republicans in North Carolina in 2021. When the state’s top court ruled that the map violated North Carolina’s constitution, Republican state lawmakers asked the Supreme Court to step in. 

They contend that the federal constitution empowers only state legislatures to regulate elections for Congress, with no role for state courts. Democratic state officials and voting-rights groups dismiss this position as “an intolerable affront” to federalism. It “clashes irreconcilably”, they say, with “principles on which our republic was built”.

## The EU’s economy starts to shiver

Could Vladimir Putin’s efforts to hurt the [European economy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/24/europe-faces-an-enduring-crisis-of-energy-and-geopolitics) soon start to bite? Wednesday’s release of detailed GDP figures revised the EU’s growth in the third quarter of 2022 upwards to 0.3%, compared with the second quarter. Not great, but no recession either. Most of the growth came from investment, as businesses and households upgraded their kit to prepare for higher energy costs.

But that boost may not last. Incoming data point to a [looming recession](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/10/11/as-europe-falls-into-recession-russia-climbs-out). Retail sales in October were down; sentiment indicators for manufacturing and construction remain depressed. Most worrying, the whole services sector is weakening, with the steepest fall in activity since February 2021.

The one bright spot is the labour market. Businesses expect to hire more workers and unemployment remains very low. That, at least, sends a positive signal: the EU’s economy may be frail, but businesses seem to not expect that weakness to last.

## Britain’s workforce has fallen ill

A report released on Wednesday by the Institute for Public Policy Research, a think-tank, makes worrying reading. Britain is the only G7 country whose labour force has not yet returned to its pre-pandemic size. Some 2.5m Britons in its 36m workforce are economically inactive because of illness. And those in work are getting sicker: workers are 13% more likely to have a health condition than they were three years ago.

This bodes ill for Britain’s [chronically unproductive economy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/06/09/britains-productivity-problem-is-long-standing-and-getting-worse): regions with higher rates of sickness tend to have lower productivity. And blue-collar workers were more likely to miss work, exacerbating economic inequalities that have only become more entrenched during the pandemic.

To heal the economy, the IPPR recommends that policymakers improve prevention of avoidable illnesses and push for quicker access to doctors and treatments. Workplaces should also be more accommodating to those with poor health. Britain’s ailing economy can scarcely afford a sickly workforce.

## How to save the Earth’s biodiversity

COP15, the UN’s 15th summit on biodiversity, begins in Montreal on Wednesday. More than 20,000 delegates will spend a fortnight debating how to save Earth’s plant and animal species, over 12% of which are at risk of extinction.

[Healthy ecosystems](https://te.arielherself.xyz/technology-quarterly/2021/06/15/loss-of-biodiversity-poses-as-great-a-risk-to-humanity-as-climate-change) provide food, building materials and medicines. Plants release oxygen and absorb about 11bn tonnes of carbon dioxide each year; the oceans another 10bn. (Humans emit about 50bn tonnes.) The World Bank estimates that ecosystem degradation will reduce[ global GDP](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2021/02/06/how-should-economists-think-about-biodiversity) by $225bn by 2030.

All of the UN’s previous biodiversity targets were missed. The hope is that COP15 will yield a stronger set of measurable, legally binding rules, as the Paris agreement did for climate change. Many countries want a commitment to protect 30% of the world’s land and oceans by 2030 (and money to do it). But how to get there remains opaque—especially when America remains one of the few countries not to have ratified COP’s underlying Convention on Biological Diversity.

## Veronica Ryan wins the Turner prize

On Wednesday Veronica Ryan, a 66-year-old British sculptor born in Montserrat, won the Turner prize, Britain’s most important contemporary-art award. Ms Ryan made the first permanent public artwork commemorating the [Windrush generation](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2018/04/18/the-national-shame-of-britains-treatment-of-windrush-migrants), Caribbean migrants who came to Britain between 1948 and 1971. That sculpture—three Caribbean fruits made of bronze and marble—was installed in Hackney, in east London, last year. Alex Farquharson, director of Tate Britain and the co-chair of the jury, praised Ms Ryan’s “slow-burn work” and its treatment of themes such as “survival, care and…trauma”. 

The four finalists for this year’s prize included no men and no artists’ collectives ([in contrast with the situation in 2021](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2021/12/02/array-collective-a-group-from-belfast-wins-the-turner-prize), when only groups were shortlisted). The other three included Ingrid Pollard, another black British artist with a long career exploring historic racism and the lasting effects of colonisation. Heather Phillipson and Sin Wai Kin are younger, and their concerns have more recent origins. These include the dynamics of boy bands, the future of the planet and gender identity.
