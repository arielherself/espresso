<strong>Germany </strong>is expected to announce the dispatch of its Leopard <strong>tanks</strong> to Ukraine on Wednesday, following much [dithering and pressure from allies](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/01/22/what-western-armour-gives-ukraine-in-the-next-round-of-the-war). America is similarly poised to send its Abrams tanks, according to a report in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. The U-turn, which will also allow Poland and other countries to export their German-made Leopards, comes after NATO talks in Berlin on Tuesday.

<strong>America’s</strong> justice department and eight states, including California and New York, sued <strong>Google</strong>, alleging that it illegally dominates the online-advertising market. They accused the tech giant of preventing publishers and advertisers from transacting over rival ad exchanges, among other anti-competitive practices. The lawsuit—the [second](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2020/10/21/american-trustbusters-take-on-google) federal antitrust case brought against Google—seeks to force the firm to divest several ad products.

Documents with classified markings from <strong>Mike Pence’s</strong> tenure as vice-president in the Trump administration were found at his Indiana home. His aides conducted the search last week, after news broke of President Joe Biden’s <strong>documents scandal</strong>. Mr Pence had been “unaware” of their presence, said his lawyer. American prosecutors are [investigating](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2023/01/13/the-presidential-mislaying-of-classified-documents-is-infectious) both Donald Trump and Mr Biden for similar offences.

<strong>Microsoft’s</strong> quarterly revenues grew by 2% from the same period a year ago, to $52.7bn, while its profit, of $16.4bn, fell by 12%. Year-over-year revenue growth from [Azure](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/08/29/the-cloud-computing-giants-are-vying-to-protect-fat-profits), the tech giant’s cloud offering, was 31%, a slowdown from the past two quarters. Sales decreased at parts of the business serving the consumer market, such as at Xbox, the video-game division.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Ukraine’s </strong>government removed senior officials amid various <strong>corruption scandals</strong>. On Monday Ukraine’s deputy infrastructure minister was detained for allegedly stealing $400,000 allocated for aid. The deputy head of Ukraine’s presidential administration resigned after being criticised for his luxurious lifestyle. The deputy prosecutor-general, who took a controversial holiday to Spain, was also dismissed. 

Former senior officials in <strong>Lebanon</strong> were charged with homicide and probable intent linked to the 2020 [Beirut blast](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/04/beirut-marks-an-awful-anniversary-with-more-disaster). Among the accused is <strong>Hassan Diab</strong>, who was prime minister at the time and resigned days after the disaster, which killed more than 200 people. Lebanese authorities had stalled the probe for a year.

“Everything Everywhere All At Once”, a maximalist metaverse action-comedy, led the <strong>Academy Awards</strong> nominations with 11 nods. Behind it were “[The Banshees of Inisherin](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/11/23/the-best-films-of-2022)” and Netflix’s “All Quiet on the Western Front”, with nine each. Three Asian actors from “Everything Everywhere” were nominated, as was Hong Chau for “The Whale”, setting a yearly record for actors of Asian descent. The ceremony is on March 12th.

<strong>Fact of the day</strong>: 467,000, the number of working days British employers lost to strikes in November, the highest in over a decade. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2023/01/19/britains-trade-unions-lose-faith-in-the-pay-review-bodies).

## Ukraine looks set to get Leopard tanks

The Leopards may soon be set free. After refusing to send its domestically made tanks to Ukraine, or allowing other countries to do so, the government of Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, is expected to announce a U-turn on January 25th. Mr Scholz resisted for months, deeming the tanks “offensive[ weapons](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/01/21/apart-from-leopard-tanks-ukraine-is-getting-lots-of-weapons)” that could lead to escalation with Russia. But leaving a meeting with Germany’s defence minister on Tuesday morning, NATO’s secretary-general said he was “confident” of a forthcoming breakthrough.

Such optimism was not misplaced. Last week Mr Scholz’s officials said sending Leopards would depend on America supplying Abrams tanks. Germany appears to have got its way: reports suggest that Joe Biden’s administration is poised to send Abrams tanks to Ukraine. Mr Scholz seems to have come around at last—but not before[ wasting every opportunity](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/04/23/why-olaf-scholz-hesitates-to-send-ukraine-heavy-weapons) for Germany to lead Europe.

## European v American inflation

Predicting inflation is tricky. Many failed to foresee its heights last year, and just as many are surprised by its decline in recent months. The fall has largely been driven by energy prices coming down. The new composite PMI numbers for Europe, released on Tuesday morning, provide some further insights into [inflation pressures](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2023/01/19/could-europe-end-up-with-a-worse-inflation-problem-than-america) in the manufacturing and services sectors. American figures will be released later in the day.

Europe was harder hit than America by supply disruptions in the wake of the covid pandemic. Those disruptions seem to be now easing, slowing the rise in input prices for European businesses. But selling prices continue to climb. Increasing wage costs could be part of the reason. In Europe, where wages are often decided in collective-bargaining agreements, pay has been increasing more slowly than in America’s flexible and tight labour market, but is now steadily piling pressure on prices. Europe’s inflation race is not over just yet.

## Microsoft and the tech downturn

The fortunes of the world’s biggest enterprise-software firm may offer clues to the state of the tech industry overall. Since November 2021 [Microsoft](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/12/01/trustbusters-should-let-microsoft-buy-activision-blizzard)’s shares have fallen by 27%. That is two percentage points fewer than the tech-heavy Nasdaq index, probably because Microsoft’s customers are disproportionately businesses⁠—which have tended to cut back less than consumers have. 

Still, Microsoft’s quarterly results on Tuesday may make for grim reading. Last week the firm said it planned to lay off 10,000 people—about 5% of its global workforce. Analysts expect that year-on-year revenue growth will slow to around 2% in the last quarter of 2022, down from 11% in the previous one. A yet-bigger worry is the slowing of Microsoft’s [cloud](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/08/29/the-cloud-computing-giants-are-vying-to-protect-fat-profits) business, which accounts for two-fifths of sales. The relatively new cloud-computing industry has never been through a sustained downturn, and so it is unclear how it might perform. Small wonder, then, that Microsoft is looking at other ways to boost business. On Monday it announced a “multibillion dollar” investment in OpenAI, an artificial-intelligence startup. 

## A Trump probe in Georgia heats up

In Donald Trump’s [knot](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/05/how-much-legal-jeopardy-is-donald-trump-in) of legal challenges, one important thread is an inquiry into his attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. A county-level prosecutor launched an investigation a month after Mr Trump phoned a state official and asked him to “find” enough votes for him to win. (The former president defended the phone call as “perfect”.) A special grand jury has compelled unco-operative witnesses to testify, including Rudy Giuliani (Mr Trump’s former lawyer) and Lindsey Graham (a Republican senator).

The investigation wrapped up in January. On Tuesday a judge will hear arguments over whether the special grand jury’s report should be made public. It could include recommendations for criminal charges, such as solicitations of election fraud—though any indictments would come from a separate grand jury. “The allegations are very serious”, said the prosecutor. But as long as the report remains sealed, it will be hard to know the real risks Mr Trump is facing.

## The many woes of El Salvador

President Nayib Bukele said El Salvador had repaid its creditors &quot;in full&quot; as $604m of bonds matured on Tuesday. Concerns that the Central American country might default were alleviated last year when the government secured a $450m loan from the Central American Bank for Economic Integration and executed two bond buybacks. But investors’ confidence in El Salvador remains low. The public debt-to-GDP ratio stands at over 80%. In September Fitch, a ratings agency, downgraded the country’s debt yet again.

The uncertainty is thanks almost entirely to Mr Bukele&#x27;s unconventional leadership. After making El Salvador the first country in the world in which [bitcoin is legal tender](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/11/17/el-salvadors-bitcoin-experiment-is-not-paying-off), in September 2021, Mr Bukele started to invest public money in the cryptocurrency. But the government’s portfolio has lost almost half its value since then, a loss worth some $52m. Some of his other policies are expensive, too. A crackdown on gangs has swelled the prison population. And the cost is not just financial: many innocent people have been rounded up.
