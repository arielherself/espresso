## <p align="center">Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter</p>

<strong>Germany’s</strong> chancellor, Olaf Scholz, urged <strong>Russia’s</strong> president, Vladimir Putin, to withdraw troops from Ukraine and fully implement a UN-backed deal to [export grain](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/07/28/will-the-grain-deal-between-russia-and-ukraine-reduce-global-hunger) from Ukraine and Russia. The pair spoke by telephone for 90 minutes. The direction of the war has turned in recent days. Earlier <strong>Ukraine’s </strong>president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said the country’s troops have now reconquered 6,000 square kilometres of [previously Russian-held territory](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/11/is-russia-on-the-run) in the south and east.

<strong>America’s rate of inflation</strong> in August [did not slow](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/09/13/despite-rosier-figures-america-still-has-an-inflation-problem) as much as had been expected, according to figures released on Tuesday. Year-on-year, prices rose by 8.3%, whereas analysts had forecast 8.1%. Overall prices were 0.1% higher than in July. Lower fuel prices tempered the effect. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, increased by 0.6% in August: steeper even than the 0.3% predicted by economists. Pressure on the Federal Reserve to [raise interest rates](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/07/27/the-fed-is-no-longer-taking-baby-steps-to-rein-in-inflation) has not gone away.

<strong>Twitter </strong>shareholders voted to approve <strong>Elon Musk’s</strong> acquisition of the social-media firm for $44bn. Twitter and Mr Musk are suing each other over his attempt to [renege on the purchase agreement](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/07/11/with-or-without-elon-musk-twitter-is-overdue-a-shake-up). Next month they will test their competing claims in a Delaware court. Shortly before the vote Peiter Zatko, Twitter’s former security chief, testified before Congress about the firm’s lax privacy standards.

Emmanuel Macron, <strong>France’s</strong> president, said he would launch a series of debates across the country and convene a group of citizens to explore legalising <strong>assisted suicide</strong>. French law permits doctors to sedate terminally ill patients until death and withhold life-saving treatments, but [euthanasia](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2021/11/13/in-the-west-assisted-dying-is-rapidly-becoming-legal-and-accepted) is illegal. Findings will be presented in March 2023, perhaps followed by a parliamentary vote or referendum.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Canada’s</strong> prime minister, Justin Trudeau, unveiled an <strong>inflation-relief package</strong> worth C$4.5 billion ($3.43 billion) for low-income earners. Qualifying individuals and households will see their quarterly tax credit doubled and receive a C$500 top-up to a rental assistance plan. Canadian inflation was at 7.6% in July, significantly over the central bank’s 2% target.

Troops from <strong>Armenia </strong>and <strong>Azerbaijan </strong>clashed along their international border. Armenian officials said that Azerbaijan had shelled their country’s forward positions and deployed drones, resulting in the deaths of at least 49 Armenian soldiers. Azerbaijan accused Armenia of performing “large-scale subversive acts” and shelling its military positions and civilian infrastructure. The Caucasian foes have fought two bloody wars over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. The most recent, in 2020, ended in a humiliating [defeat](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2020/11/12/a-peace-deal-ends-a-bloody-war-over-nagorno-karabakh) for Armenia.

The coffin of [<strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong>](https://te.arielherself.xyz/obituary/2022/09/08/elizabeth-ii-never-laid-down-the-heavy-weight-of-the-crown) was flown from Edinburgh to London. <strong>King Charles III</strong>, the queen’s [successor](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/09/what-will-charles-do-now), travelled to Northern Ireland to meet with senior politicians and religious leaders. The queen’s funeral will take place on September 19th.

## America&#x27;s stubborn inflation

The White House used to dread monthly [inflation](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/07/27/the-silver-linings-of-a-recession) reports. Each was worse than the previous one; each delivered a blow to President Joe Biden’s popularity. But that has [started to change](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/05/for-a-change-american-inflation-is-lower-than-expected). In July consumer prices remained the same as in June—the first absence of month-on-month inflation since early 2020. Figures for August, released on Tuesday, <em>revealed an incremental headline increase: inflation was up by 0.1% from July.</em>

Receding inflation has boosted Mr Biden’s approval ratings ahead of November’s [midterm elections](https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/us-midterms-2022/forecast/senate). Even Republicans are toning down their criticism of his [record](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/08/02/regional-differences-in-american-inflation-hit-a-40-year-high). But economists will be harsher. The main reason for America’s subdued inflation is a steep fall in oil prices. Strip out volatile energy and food costs, and <em>core inflation increased by 0.6%, a larger increase than in July</em>. <em>Compared to a year ago, core inflation remains at a stubborn 6.3%.</em> That is not low enough to prove that inflation is fading. Analysts and investors think the Federal Reserve will [stay hawkish](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/07/27/the-fed-is-no-longer-taking-baby-steps-to-rein-in-inflation) for now.

## The mood in Moscow has shifted

In recent days Russian forces have suffered their most [serious](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/11/is-russia-on-the-run) reversal in Ukraine since they gave up their quest for Kyiv [in March](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/03/28/russia-says-it-is-changing-its-war-aims-in-ukraine). Ukraine’s liberation of at least 6,000 square kilometres has scuppered Russia’s hopes of controlling the whole of Donbas, the country’s contested eastern region. 

As Ukrainians rejoice, the faces on Russian television are crestfallen. State media offer a euphemism: troops are “regrouping”. But Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has been silent on the extraordinary developments, letting a spokesman assert Russia’s determination to prevail. On Saturday, as his troops retreated in Ukraine, Mr Putin was opening a ferris wheel in a Moscow park.

Mr Putin is under pressure. Pro-war Russian military bloggers are livid with their own side. Nationalists are calling for strategic changes, including general conscription. But sending more reluctant, poorly trained soldiers to face powerful American weapons would hardly be popular. Meanwhile, despite the [surprising resilience](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/23/why-the-russian-economy-keeps-beating-expectations) of the Russian economy, the West’s sanctions are [hurting](https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2022/06/08/holiday-dilemmas-of-the-russian-elite) the country’s elite. Mr Putin is far from losing the war, but his fight is becoming more dire.

## Singapore opens up to travellers

During the pandemic Singapore’s national carrier, Singapore Airlines, was so short of business that it sold locals dining spots on board a grounded double-decker A380 plane. Between 2019 and 2021 passenger numbers at Changi airport, the main air hub, plunged by 96%. But since the government began loosening border restrictions late last year, [tourists have started returning](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2021/10/23/restarting-asian-tourism-will-be-harder-than-shutting-it-down). This summer traffic at Changi reached 50% of pre-pandemic levels. To handle the increased traffic, on Tuesday the airport reopens Terminal 4, which closed in May 2020.

Singapore’s reopening contrasts with ongoing travel restrictions in its [regional rival](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/06/30/the-biggest-risks-to-singapores-primacy-in-asian-finance-are-at-home), Hong Kong, where passenger numbers stand at about 5% pre-pandemic levels. Hong Kong, a former [business and travel hub](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/06/30/the-biggest-risks-to-singapores-primacy-in-asian-finance-are-at-home), still obliges in-bound travellers to quarantine in a hotel for three nights. But opposition to the restrictions is growing among Hong Kong’s business community, and the authorities are starting to take note. Quarantine rules for local air crews were eased at the weekend.

## Kenya’s controversial new president

[William Ruto](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/08/16/who-is-william-ruto), who was sworn in as Kenya’s new president on Tuesday, has an alarming history. His political life began in the thuggish youth wing of the ruling party under [Daniel arap Moi](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2020/02/06/the-legacy-of-daniel-arap-moi-still-haunts-kenya), the late dictator. After a disputed election in 2007 the International Criminal Court accused Mr Ruto of orchestrating ethnic violence; he denied wrongdoing and the case later collapsed. Corruption allegations, which Mr Ruto insists are concocted, have dogged his career.

Mr Ruto campaigned for the presidency with a populist, anti-establishment message. But he vows to rule democratically. Significantly, he has promised to bolster the independence of the criminal-justice system from the government by granting parliament the power to approve independent budgets for the judiciary and police. If Mr Ruto delivers on this point, liberal critics may be assuaged, at least for a while. Yet tougher challenges lie ahead. [Mr Ruto won ](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/15/william-ruto-is-declared-kenyas-next-president)the election promising to champion the interests of the poor. But high inflation, and Kenya’s debt-distressed economy, will not easily be tamed.

## A Uyghur voice from behind bars

A nameless Uyghur man walks around Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, in search of a place to stay. At every turn he is met with vitriol and condescension. “The Backstreets”, a Uyghur novel published in English on Tuesday, is a biting portrait of what it is like to become a second-class citizen in your own homeland. Its story reflects the life of the man who wrote it.

Perhat Tursun, a novelist and poet known for challenging Uyghur social norms, finished “The Backstreets” in 2006. His writing later earned him a 16-year-prison sentence as he became one of the [countless ](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/in-xinjiang-officials-are-trying-to-stamp-out-uyghur-identity/21805768)Uyghur [intellectuals](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/in-xinjiang-officials-are-trying-to-stamp-out-uyghur-identity/21805768) detained by the Chinese state. Darren Byler, an American anthropologist and one of the book’s two translators, discovered the text on an internet forum. Working with a Uyghur man credited only as Anonymous, Mr Byler finished his translation in 2015. Since then the anonymous translator has also been detained. “The Backstreets” has been critically acclaimed. But neither its author nor its Uyghur translator will hear that praise.
