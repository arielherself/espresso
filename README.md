<p align="center">Origin: <a href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-in-brief">https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-in-brief</a><hr>

<strong>Xi Jinping</strong>, China’s president, [secured a third term](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/10/20/xi-jinping-has-no-interest-in-succession-planning) in power and unveiled the reshuffled leadership of China’s Communist Party. The new seven-member Politburo Standing Committee is comprised of loyalists to Mr Xi, including Li Qiang, the top party official in Shanghai, who was appointed second-in-command. On Saturday the closing ceremony of the [CCP’s congress](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/10/16/at-chinas-communist-party-congress-xi-jinping-sails-on-undaunted) was marked by the unexplained removal of Hu Jintao, a former president, from the stage.

Heavy Russian <strong>missile strikes</strong> on Ukraine’s energy facilities left over a million people in the south and west of the country struggling with power cuts. The Ukrainian army said Russia launched at least 33 cruise missiles, of which 18 were downed. The barrage is part of [a campaign](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/13/russias-terror-strikes-fail-to-do-much-damage-to-ukraine) to cripple Ukraine’s infrastructure and demoralise the population as winter approaches.

<strong>Rishi Sunak</strong>, a former British chancellor, confirmed his intention to run in the [contest to replace Liz Truss](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/10/20/who-will-be-britains-next-leader) as leader of the Conservative Party and thus as prime minister. <strong>Penny Mordaunt</strong>, the leader of the House of Commons, has [also announced](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/07/15/who-is-penny-mordaunt) her candidacy. <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>, who [resigned](https://te.arielherself.xyz/films/2022/07/07/britain-after-boris) as prime minister in July, is said to be considering a run too. Contenders need 100 nominations from fellow MPs by Monday.

Salman Rushdie lost the sight in one eye and the use of one hand during a [knife attack](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/08/18/salman-rushdie-and-the-struggle-for-free-speech) in New York in August, his agent revealed. Sir Salman’s assailant has been charged with attempted murder. In 1989 Iran’s supreme leader issued a <em>fatwa</em> urging Muslims to murder the author because of the alleged blasphemy of his novel, [“The Satanic Verses”](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-reads/2022/08/16/an-introduction-to-the-works-of-salman-rushdie).

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Slovenians</strong> are choosing a new president in an election seen as a test for the country’s liberal [government](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/06/23/with-a-pro-orban-prime-minister-gone-things-are-looking-up-in-slovenia), which won power from populists in April. Like its EU neighbours Slovenia is suffering from an [energy crisis](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/10/11/the-countries-most-at-risk-from-europes-energy-crunch) fuelled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Anze Logar, a member of the former government, is leading in polls but the contest is expected to go to a run-off next month.

More than 5m Americans in 39 states have already cast their ballots, ahead of the <strong>midterms </strong>in November. Early voting turnout is high in [key races](https://te.arielherself.xyz/mid-terms-2022), including Georgia and Ohio. At the current rate turnout could meet, or exceed, the number of votes cast in the last midterm elections, in 2018, which saw the biggest turnout since 1978.

<strong>Hurricane Roslyn</strong> strengthened to a major Category 4 storm as it headed towards the Pacific coast of <strong>Mexico</strong>. America’s hurricane centre said it could bring hazardous winds, flash flooding and a damaging storm surge. Hundreds of people have been evacuated to emergency shelters. It is expected to make landfall on Sunday.

<strong>Word of the week: </strong>“cicerone”, an expert in beer. Their number has grown in America with the proliferation of craft beers. [Read the full article](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/10/20/the-growth-of-the-cicerone-shows-how-craft-beer-is-thriving).

## What’s next on the battlefield in Ukraine

In the next six weeks Ukraine has a window of opportunity to recapture the [strategic southern city of Kherson](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/08/30/why-does-kherson-matter) before winter, according to American officials. Rumours that they are about to do so have been circulating for at least a month, and Russia has evacuated many non-military personnel. Yet the front lines appear to have barely moved since a quick Ukrainian advance a fortnight ago.

A long-running Russian offensive near Bakhmut in the eastern Donbas region is making no progress either. But Russia has had more success in degrading Ukraine’s electrical grid. Attacks by cruise missiles and cheap [Iranian-made drones](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/19/iranian-drones-pose-a-fiendish-military-problem-for-ukraine) have knocked out 30% of the country’s generating capacity. Air-raid sirens and partial blackouts have become a daily event in Kyiv, the capital. The West is supplying Ukraine with more and better air-defence systems. But Iran is not just selling drones to Russia. American intelligence claims it has sent pilots to Crimea to fly them.

## An intriguing debate in the Golden State

California has always attracted dreamers, from aspiring actors to miners during the Gold Rush. Brian Dahle, the Republican candidate for governor, is also battling the odds. On Sunday Mr Dahle, a state senator from northern California, will debate Gavin Newsom, the incumbent Democratic governor. Mr Dahle trails Mr Newsom by 23% in the polls. Yet the uncompetitive race is still worth watching.

The first reason is the resilience and rise of Mr Newsom. Last year he beat a “recall” campaign that threatened to remove him from office, and now he is rumoured to be considering a presidential bid after his second and final term as governor. He is already channelling campaign funds into [attacking Republican governors in other states](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/07/28/californias-governor-takes-aim-at-texas-with-a-new-gun-law) over social issues. Wider recognition will help his presidential chances. 

The second is that it underscores just how Democratic California has become. A Republican was last elected as governor in 2006, and registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by about two to one.

## New analysis of the story of covid

The origins of covid-19 are hotly contested. Many think it was a spillover from wild animals. Others have pointed to the coronavirus engineering going on in laboratories around the world, but particularly in Wuhan—the Chinese city where the virus was first identified.

Into this fray comes [analysis](https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2022/10/22/a-new-paper-claims-sars-cov-2-bears-signs-of-genetic-engineering) from Alex Washburne, a mathematical biologist who runs Selva, a small startup in microbiome science, Antonius VanDongen, of Duke University, and Valentin Bruttel of University of Würzburg. Their claim, published on October 20th on bioRxiv, a preprint server, suggests SARS-CoV-2 has some genomic features that they say would appear if the virus had been stitched together by genetic engineering. By examining how many of these putative stitching sites SARS-CoV-2 has, and how relatively short these pieces are, they attempt to assess how much the virus resembles others found in nature.

The paper has not yet been peer reviewed. Early reactions, though, have been deeply divided. Any widely supported conclusion that the virus was engineered would have profound ramifications, both political and scientific.

## Is Formula 1’s spending cap fit for purpose?

Formula 1 returns to Texas for the American Grand Prix. But with the drivers’ championship already won, for a second successive year, by Max Verstappen, a Dutch driver for the Red Bull team, fans have turned their attention to a row over the competition’s spending cap. 

Last week the sport’s governing body, the FIA, said that Red Bull had exceeded the team limit of $145m for 2021, the first year it was enforced. The cap is meant to make F1 more competitive by levelling the playing field. Red Bull dismissed the accusation as “fictitious” and said it had done nothing wrong. Meanwhile other voices—including Lewis Hamilton, a British driver for Mercedes, and Zak Brown, the team boss for McLaren—are calling for the team to be punished. If there has been a breach and the FIA fails to take action, the effort to control spending will have stalled on the grid.

## Weekend profile: John Fetterman, Pennsylvania’s Democratic Senate nominee

John Fetterman looks like no other senator. Bald, goateed, tattooed and well over two metres tall, he almost always wears his signature hoodie and shorts in public. He is [running for an open Senate seat](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/29/john-fetterman-is-a-canny-politician) in Pennsylvania against Mehmet Oz, a Republican television personality and former surgeon. The race may determine control of the Senate in America’s midterms on November 8th. So beyond his striking appearance, who is he?

Born in 1969, Mr Fetterman grew up in a conservative home in southern Pennsylvania. He played American football at university and expected to take over his father’s insurance business. But as he tells it, his friend’s sudden death in a car crash propelled him towards public service. He graduated from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, then taught high-school drop-outs in Braddock, a rough suburb of Pittsburgh.

In 2005 he ran for mayor of Braddock, and won by a single vote. He served three full terms, then campaigned for the Senate in 2016, losing in the primary. He then ran successfully for lieutenant-governor in 2018. His duties include presiding over the state senate (which he does, for dress-code reasons, in the one suit he owns) and Pennsylvania’s pardons board, which reviews felons’ requests for pardons and commutations. Long an advocate for criminal-justice reform, under his leadership the board has pardoned far more people than past boards.

Republicans have attacked him for being weak on crime—and, more broadly, for being far more left-wing than his blue-collar demeanour suggests. And indeed, Mr Fetterman endorsed Bernie Sanders for president in 2016, supports legalising cannabis and, aside from his support for fracking, is generally a liberal Democrat, even if he comes off as just another guy at the bar.

A bigger concern is his health: Mr Fetterman had a stroke in May. Since then he has given few interviews, agreed to just a single debate (to be held on Tuesday) and appeared halting in public. He has tried to make a virtue of his struggles, asking audiences at his rallies how many of them know someone with health problems. He may eventually fully recover. But if his condition is worse than he lets on, he will look slippery and evasive—the opposite of the straight-shooting persona he has created.
