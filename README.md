<strong>Turkey’s </strong>president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, declared a three-month state of emergency in ten provinces affected by [large earthquakes](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2023/02/06/massive-earthquakes-in-turkey-and-northern-syria-kill-thousands) in the south of the country and neighbouring <strong>Syria</strong>. The quakes on Monday have already left at least 5,100 people dead. That number looks certain to rise; the World Health Organisation suggested that fatalities could reach 20,000. The initial quake’s epicentre was near the Turkish city of Gaziantep and had a magnitude of 7.8—the strongest in the region since one near Istanbul in 1999 that killed more than 17,000 people. A series of aftershocks followed. 

<strong>Russia</strong> is gathering reinforcements and equipment ahead of a [new offensive](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/02/01/ukraines-troops-in-the-east-are-quietly-confident) in eastern Ukraine, according to the governor of the Luhansk region. <strong>Ukraine</strong> has long warned that a new Russian offensive is in the offing. But Britain’s defence ministry said that Russia had probably already tried to launch its offensive, but lacked the “munitions and manoeuvre units” for success.

The <strong>Pentagon</strong> said it had failed to detect previous <strong>Chinese surveillance balloons</strong> in American airspace, discovering them only later through “additional means of [intelligence] collection”. General Glen VanHerck called it an “awareness gap that we have to figure out”. At least four other intrusions had occurred in recent years before [last month’s](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2023/02/03/how-a-balloon-burst-sino-american-talks). America said it would not return the debris from the destroyed balloon to China.

Thousands attended the funeral prayers of <strong>Pervez Musharraf</strong>, Pakistan’s former [president](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2023/02/05/pervez-musharraf-was-one-of-pakistans-better-dictators), in Karachi, a city in the south of the country. Mr Musharraf, who died on Sunday, led a coup in 1999 and went on to rule Pakistan for nearly a decade, first as “chief executive” then as president. He had lived in Dubai since 2016. 

<strong>Alphabet</strong>, the parent company of Google, unveiled <strong>Bard</strong>, a [chatbot powered by artificial intelligence](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2023/01/30/the-race-of-the-ai-labs-heats-up). It will rival <strong>ChatGPT</strong> from OpenAI, a Microsoft-backed artificial-intelligence startup that builds models which can generate text and images that seem as though they are created by humans. Various firms plan to add similar technology, including Baidu, a Chinese search giant. Bard will be tested on some users before a full launch in the coming weeks. 

The share price of some <strong>Adani Group</strong> companies rose on Tuesday, after suffering another miserable day on Monday. The value of the Indian conglomerate has now fallen by more than $100bn in two weeks. The sell-off started after [<strong>Hindenburg Research</strong>](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2023/02/02/hindenburg-research-attacker-of-the-adani-empire), an American short-seller, made [allegations of fraud](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2023/02/01/what-next-for-gautam-adanis-embattled-empire). Hundreds of protesters took to the streets in Delhi and other Indian cities on Monday, amid growing calls to investigate the allegations.

A British<strong> “digital pound”</strong> could be launched in the next decade according to the Treasury and the Bank of England. It would provide a state-backed alternative to potentially volatile digital currencies issued by private companies. Britain’s chancellor, [Jeremy Hunt](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2023/02/02/meet-ms-heeves-the-face-of-britains-new-political-consensus), said the digital pound would offer a “trusted and accessible” payment method. A consultation on the idea begins on Tuesday, but a final decision will not be taken until around 2025.

<strong>Correction: </strong>In Tuesday’s edition we incorrectly wrote that ChatGPT can generate images and videos. In fact it is OpenAI, a Microsoft-backed artificial-intelligence startup that created ChatGPT, which builds models that aim to do so. Sorry.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>2.2%, the contraction of Russia’s GDP last year, which defied many economists’ expectations of an annual decline of 10% or more. [Read the full story.](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/02/04/russias-technocrats-keep-funds-flowing-for-vladimir-putins-war)

## Biden’s state of the union

President Joe Biden will deliver the annual state-of-the-union address to Congress on Tuesday. With Republicans in control of the House of Representatives, Mr Biden’s window for passing big-ticket legislation has closed. So instead of laying out a bold agenda, his speech will trumpet his policy wins to date. 

In preparation for a [re-election bid](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/11/10/joe-biden-should-not-seek-re-election) next year—expected to be announced soon—the president will probably remind Americans of his job-creation efforts and major infrastructure and climate bills. Foreign policy will no doubt also feature prominently. Concerns about China are fresh in American minds after the shooting down of a [Chinese balloon](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/02/04/the-sino-american-rivalry-needs-guardrails-to-contain-small-incidents) that was detected flying over sensitive military sites. And support for Ukraine remains high on the agenda ahead of the anniversary of Russia’s invasion on February 24th. Still, Mr Biden will know that some will scrutinise the delivery of his speech as much as its substance. His age (80) remains a major concern for voters looking to 2024.

## Poor construction makes earthquakes more deadly

The huge earthquakes that [struck](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2023/02/06/massive-earthquakes-in-turkey-and-northern-syria-kill-thousands) southern Turkey and northern Syria on Monday have killed at least 5,100 people. They were the strongest in the region since one near Istanbul in 1999 that killed over 17,000 people. That disaster, and botched search-and-rescue efforts, exposed a deeply flawed urban development model, corrupt building practices and lack of preparedness in Turkey. Some problems persist.

Under Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in [power](https://te.arielherself.xyz/special-report/2023/01/16/turkey-is-still-just-a-democracy-but-it-is-not-certain-to-remain-that-way) since 2003, disaster response has improved. More than 3m housing units have been renovated and strengthened. Yet apartment blocks built on the cheap or in defiance of building codes continue to crowd Turkish cities and towns. An amnesty on unregistered construction work, passed by Mr Erdogan’s government in 2018 and which has had 9m applications, has not helped. It risked turning Turkish cities into “graveyards” in an earthquake, Cemal Gokce, the chairman of the Chamber of Civil Engineers, said a year later. His words may have proved prescient. 

## How is big oil spending its profit bonanza?

The coffers of big oil companies are overflowing. So far this year Shell unveiled net profits for 2022 of nearly $40bn; during the same period ExxonMobil made a record net profit of $55.7bn and Chevron’s doubled. BP added to the haul on Tuesday, reporting a profit of $27.7bn (£23bn) for 2022, more than double its total for 2021 ($12.8bn). TotalEnergies will also announce results on Wednesday. In total the five oil “supermajors” may have raked in around $200bn in profits.  
  
 Some of this bounty will flow back to shareholders, but a wedge will be invested. Where and how that money is spent is changing. Bosses need energy that is faster to market, less risky to develop, cleaner to produce and closer to home. Having been forced to abandon their assets in [Russia](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2023/01/29/how-russia-dodges-oil-sanctions-on-an-industrial-scale) after the invasion of Ukraine, some are diverting investments to the Americas, a region with relatively low-risk and low-cost reserves. Oil companies are also responding to pressure from activists and policymakers to decarbonise their portfolios. BP, for instance, vows to spend 40% of its capital expenditure budget on low-carbon projects by 2025.

## Australia’s next interest-rate rise

Battling rising prices, Australian central bankers have raised interest rates eight times since May. Their fight is not yet over. Inflation has been slower to ease down under than in Europe and America; in December it hit an annual rate of 7.8%, the highest since 1990. The Reserve Bank of Australia responded by bumping up interest rates by another 0.25 percentage points on Tuesday, to 3.35%. It has not hit those heights since September 2012. 

Australia has some of the world’s most indebted households, and the hikes are starting to hurt. The bank’s rates rise means it will cost Aussies almost A$1,000 ($692) more per month to service a A$500,000 mortgage than it did last April, according to AMP, an Australian bank. Since then [house prices](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/24/where-the-coming-housing-crunch-will-be-most-painful) have plunged by almost 9%. And more will suffer this year as their fixed-rate loans end. To avoid a recession, monetary policymakers may soon have to pull their punches.

## A landmark art show in the Gulf

The Sharjah Biennial in the United Arab Emirates opens on Tuesday to mark 30 years since the event’s founding. The contemporary-art exhibition has always punched above its weight thanks to the ambition of Sharjah’s ruling family, who are keen curators and collectors. Still, this year’s iteration is hotly anticipated—and poignant. Its focus was conceived by Okwui Enwezor (pictured), a Nigerian curator who died of cancer in 2019. During his lifetime Mr Enwezor did more than almost any other curator to shape the way the contemporary-art world thinks about history and colonialism.

Those themes underpin the show, which is titled “Thinking Historically in the Present” and curated by Hoor Al Qasimi, director of the Sharjah Art Foundation. In five towns across the emirate, the event will display new work by an array of artists. They include Wangechi Mutu, a Kenyan-American painter and sculptor; Sir Steve McQueen, a British film-maker; Philippe Parreno, a French conceptual artist; and Sir John Akomfrah, a Ghanaian-born British artist and director. For lovers of contemporary art it promises to be worth a trip.
