The stalemate in America’s House of Representatives continued as <strong>Kevin McCarthy </strong>[lost a sixth ballot](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/01/04/what-the-kevin-mccarthy-saga-means-for-americas-congress) to become Speaker, at which point voting was adjourned until Thursday. Twenty rebel Republicans supported Byron Donalds, a second-term congressman—Mr McCarthy needs to win over at least 16 of them to ensure success. Voting will continue until a Speaker is chosen. Earlier<strong> Donald Trump </strong>endorsed Mr McCarthy.

<strong>Amazon</strong> said it would sack more than 18,000 employees, up from the 10,000 it had previously planned. That represents about 1% of Amazon’s workforce, but is the biggest purge yet for a tech firm during a deepening industry [slump](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/05/14/tech-bubbles-are-bursting-all-over-the-place). Andy Jassy, the e-commerce giant’s boss, blamed the “uncertain economy” and excessive hiring in recent years. 

<strong>France</strong> promised to provide <strong>Ukraine</strong> with armoured combat vehicles to help in the war against Russia. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, expressed his gratitude but urged allies to provide heavier weapons, such as tanks. Meanwhile Russia deployed a frigate armed with hypersonic missiles to the Atlantic and Indian oceans in a show of [military force](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/01/04/a-russian-warlords-savagery-is-sending-a-loud-message-to-moscow).

The bloc also said that inbound passengers on Chinese flights should wear a mask. Earlier the World Health Organisation cautioned that China is under-representing the scale of the outbreak that has swept the country since it relaxed its zero-covid policy in December.

Though American <strong>inflation</strong> eased in the past few months, rate-setters at the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> stressed that “substantially more evidence of progress” was needed before they halt [interest-rate rises](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/12/20/the-year-of-the-rate-shock), according to minutes released on Wednesday from their December meeting. Separately, a survey of managers showed that American <strong>manufacturing activity</strong> contracted in December for a second consecutive month.

<strong>Stellantis</strong> inked a deal to help <strong>Archer Aviation</strong>, an American startup, manufacture a [flying taxi](https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/flying-taxis-are-lining-up-for-certification/21807390). Archer plans to produce the electric aircraft—which it says will be able to ferry five people 100 miles (160km) on a single charge—at an as-yet-unbuilt factory in Georgia in 2024. Archer has been backed by United Airlines, but this investment—of up to $150m—by a carmaker is unusual.

America approved the world’s first vaccine for <strong>honeybees </strong>to protect them from American foulbrood, a disease that ravages hives and for which there is no cure. The [shot works](https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2021/03/18/honeybees-run-vaccination-programmes-too) by incorporating bacteria into the royal jelly secreted by worker bees and fed to the queen. That ensures larvae have immunity when they hatch. The breakthrough could boost the production of food that relies on honeybee pollination.

## America’s economy loses its mojo

The world’s biggest economy is limping into the new year. A survey of America’s manufacturing sector, published on Wednesday, revealed that in December it contracted for a second consecutive month. This adds to evidence that the economy is on the cusp of a recession as the Federal Reserve’s aggressive tightening of monetary policy makes its impact felt.

A crucial question is how the Fed will respond to the slowdown. Analysts will pore over minutes from the Fed’s December meeting, released on Wednesday, to glean hints about the central bank’s thinking. The new data and minutes, though, will pale in importance compared with a jobs report on Friday. So long as America’s labour market remains robust, the Fed is likely to persist with raising rates. It worries that wage pressures will keep inflation high, even as the economy sputters.

## What Ukraine’s bullseye says about the war

Ukraine rang in the new year as Russian cruise missiles rained down on Kyiv. Hours later the country had its revenge. Using American-supplied HIMARS rocket-launchers, it destroyed a temporary barracks in a school in Makviika, in eastern Donetsk province. Russia’s defence ministry has said that 89 soldiers were killed. Ukraine and some Russian commentators say the true figure is in the hundreds.

The strike sparked fury in Russia with its military leadership. “Our generals are untrainable,” thundered Igor Girkin, who led Russia’s first invasion of Donbas in 2014. The attack shows how Russian forces still make elementary mistakes: Ukraine is thought to have picked up the mobile-phone signals of the Russian troops in the school. It also illustrates the vital role of attrition in the war, as Ukraine uses long-range precision weapons to wear down Russian forces—much as it did before offensives in [Kherson](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/11/15/the-battle-for-kherson-in-maps) and [Kharkiv](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/15/a-stunning-counter-offensive-by-ukraines-armed-forces) last year. Thinner Russian lines could pave the way for another [Ukrainian advance](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/14/three-scenarios-for-how-war-in-ukraine-could-play-out).

## France’s better news on inflation

Thanks to generous government subsidies and a [low dependency on Russian gas](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/12/15/the-french-exception), France has been relatively [well protected](https://te.arielherself.xyz/by-invitation/2022/10/28/frances-finance-minister-on-how-to-fight-inflation-and-preserve-stability) from Europe’s soaring inflation. In the year to November 2022 the French inflation rate, at 7.1%, was the second-lowest in the euro zone, after Spain’s. Indeed against expectations, provisional figures published on Wednesday by the national statistics office showed that year-on-year inflation slowed in December, to 6.7%. The Bank of France expects the country’s inflation rate to peak in the first half of 2023.

This comes at a [tricky time](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/17/emmanuel-macrons-tricky-second-term) for President Emmanuel Macron’s government. It has just ended petrol subsidies at the pump, and raised the cap on increases to electricity and gas bills to 15%. Support will be limited to small firms, such as the corner <em>boulangerie</em>. Higher costs of living will be keenly felt by many families, just as the government is controversially planning to raise the retirement age. France, no stranger to bread riots, could be in for a turbulent year.

## Myanmar’s sour toast to independence

At precisely 4.20 on Wednesday morning a four-hour military parade kicked off in Naypyidaw, the capital of Myanmar. In 1948, this was the time deemed most auspicious by astrologers for the country, then known as Burma, to declare independence from British imperial rule. Seventy-five years on, the generals now in charge are overseeing a gala of concerts and sporting tournaments.

But few citizens are sharing in the revelry. Many feel shackled anew since the army seized power in a coup nearly two years ago, destroying the country’s brief experiment in democratisation. Suppression of dissent has spiralled into an all-out [civil war](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/01/29/myanmars-grinding-conflict-is-at-risk-of-being-forgotten); armed opposition groups claim to control almost half the country. And the conflict has reverberated far beyond Myanmar’s borders as hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes. Even the generals’ traditional independence day promise to release prisoners won’t lighten the mood much; of the 7,000 mentioned on Wednesday, it is unclear whether any will be political detainees.

## Netflix and shill: Madoff on film

Fourteen years after his arrest, and almost two years after his [death in prison](https://te.arielherself.xyz/obituary/2021/04/22/bernard-madoff-died-in-prison-on-april-14th), Bernie Madoff is getting the Netflix treatment. “Madoff: The Monster of Wall Street”, a four-part docuseries about the mega-swindler, is released on Wednesday.

Madoff’s Ponzi-scheming has already inspired a welter of books, plays and television dramas, as well as a documentary about his secretary. Is there anything left to tell? Netflix insists there is. It promises “unique access to whistleblowers, employees, investigators and victims”, as well as “never-before-seen video depositions of Madoff himself”.

There are unlikely to be startling revelations. Nevertheless, the story of New York’s dodgiest investor continues to resonate, and in one important sense is not over: a liquidator is still recovering and distributing funds to bilked investors. More than $14bn has been handed back so far, with more expected in 2023. For many who lost money, the anguish and suspense continue.
