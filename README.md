## <p align="center">Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter</p>

The foreign ministers of <strong>Estonia</strong>,<strong> Latvia </strong>and<strong> Lithuania</strong>, urged Germany to send the <strong>Leopard 2</strong> tanks it makes to Ukraine. “Germany as the leading European power has special responsibility in this regard,” they wrote, a day after Germany had confirmed to Western officials [its reluctance](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/01/20/a-meeting-in-germany-approves-more-arms-for-ukraine-but-no-leopard-tanks) to do so. Other countries could also provide Leopards, but export controls mean that German hesitation affects them too.

The senior epidemiologist at <strong>China</strong>’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has argued that with around 80% of the population already infected with <strong>covid-19</strong> a further big wave of the virus is unlikely. But Wu Zunyou conceded on social media that the 5bn journeys around the country people are expected to make over the current Spring Festival will spread the epidemic farther afield.

Chris Hipkins, who oversaw <strong>New Zealand’s</strong> pandemic response under Jacinda Ardern, will replace her as leader of the Labour Party and thus prime minister following her [surprise resignation](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2023/01/19/jacinda-ardern-resigns-as-new-zealands-prime-minister). Labour lawmakers will confirm his accession on Sunday. Mr Hipkins, aged 44, currently serves as education minister and was the only candidate to stand for the job. A general election is due in October.

<strong>America</strong> said it would designate the <strong>Wagner Group</strong>, a Russian [firm of private mercenaries](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/03/07/what-is-the-wagner-group-russias-mercenary-organisation), a transnational criminal organisation and impose sanctions on it. America thinks Wagner has 50,000 fighters in Ukraine. The White House also released a photo, taken in November, showing Russian railway carriages travelling between Russia and North Korea, transporting what America said were weapons for use in Ukraine.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Russia</strong> could start selling <strong>oil</strong> to <strong>Pakistan</strong>, with an agreement likely to come by March, Russia’s energy minister said. Payment will be in the currency of “friendly” countries—meaning those that do not levy sanctions against Russia. Pakistan [typically imports](https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/briefing/2022/09/24/war-in-ukraine-has-reshaped-worlds-fuel-markets) most of its oil from the Gulf. But amid a severe balance-of-payments crisis, it is eager to take advantage of the discount for Russian crude. 

<strong>Bolivia</strong> chose a consortium led by CATL, a Chinese battery-maker, to develop the country’s lithium reserves. Luis Arce, Bolivia’s president, called the deal “historic” and said the consortium would invest more than $1bn in the project’s first phase. Global demand for lithium, which is used in [electric vehicles](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/08/14/could-the-ev-boom-run-out-of-juice-before-it-really-gets-going), is expected to soar as fossil fuels are phased out.

<strong>Amazon’s </strong>cloud-computing arm said it planned to spend $35bn on new data centres in Virginia. The state is a hub for internet infrastructure and has offered Amazon Web Services several incentives to expand its presence there. The world’s largest provider of cloud-computing services is hoping the investment will help it stay ahead of the competition in a [rapidly-expanding market](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/08/29/the-cloud-computing-giants-are-vying-to-protect-fat-profits).

<strong>Word of the week: </strong><em>chunyu</em>, meaning “pure desire” in Mandarin. The make-up style from China, which involves trying to look alluring and innocent all at once, is now trending in Japan.

## Florida’s Democrats look to rebuild

On Saturday Democrats in [Florida](https://te.arielherself.xyz/special-report/2022/03/30/like-america-the-sunshine-state-also-rises) will meet to discuss the future of their party. Resounding defeats in [America’s midterm elections](https://te.arielherself.xyz/mid-terms-2022) in 2022, in which the incumbent Republican governor Ron DeSantis won a landslide victory and carried traditionally blue counties like Miami-Dade, have prompted soul-searching among Democrats. Earlier this month Manny Diaz, the state’s Democratic Party chair, resigned after some members began the process to call a vote of no-confidence in him. 

Building a more electable party in the Sunshine State will be no easy task. Annette Taddeo, a former state senator who ran briefly for governor, is willing to try. She has entered the contest to replace Mr Diaz; others may come forward too. But reversing Republicans’ momentum in the swing state ahead of national elections in 2024 will require more than just compelling candidates. Out-of-state Democratic donors will need to chip in with resources as well. Till then Florida will look more red than purple.

## Protests persist in Peru

On Thursday Peru’s president, Dina Boluarte, declared from the presidential palace in Lima that protests against her government were under control. The chaos unfolding a few blocks away and elsewhere in the country, however, suggested otherwise: more than 50 people were injured as protests continued on Friday. A historic building in Lima went up in flames. 

At least 44 people have died in such clashes since Ms Boluarte took office on December 7th, after her left-wing predecessor, Pedro Castillo, was arrested for trying to stage a coup. Indigenous and rural people, his supporters, are particularly angry. They want new general elections and Ms Boluarte’s resignation. For now, however, she is [unlikely to step down](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2023/01/19/perus-political-chaos-looks-likely-to-persist), having formed an alliance with the centrist and right-wing parties that control Congress. Dismissing her critics as “violent and radical factions” of the population, she has called for elections to be held in April 2024, two years ahead of schedule. That has failed to appease the protesters.

## Losing the night sky to light pollution

There are few sights as awesome and humbling as the pristine night sky. The nebulous band of the Milky Way has long captivated mankind. But the spread of artificial light has robbed huge swathes of the globe of this nightly spectacle. And according to new research in <em>Science</em>, a journal, the heavens are dimming faster than previously thought.

Globe at Night enlists members of the public to observe the night sky with the naked eye, logging their location. Over the past dozen years stargazers have contributed more than 50,000 observations to the project. They revealed an average rise in light pollution of 10% a year, much worse than satellite imagery had suggested. Astronomers are calling for harsher restrictions on [light pollution](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2021/11/26/why-the-nights-grow-less-dark-and-what-to-do-about-it). Otherwise, the firmament will continue to fade; and perhaps with it, humanity’s sense of itself within the cosmos.

## Divining indie cinema’s future at Sundance

Sundance, the celebrated Utah showcase for independent movies, which runs through the weekend, has returned in-person for the first time since 2020. At the virtual edition in 2021 Apple bought the rights to “CODA”, a film directed by Sian Heder, for $25m, a festival record. It became the first Sundance selection to win the [Academy Award](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/03/28/have-the-oscars-lost-their-way) for Best Picture. But most Sundance movies are destined for the speciality film market, which is still sorting out its business model as audiences choose streaming over cinemas.

Sundance earns its cultural cachet by eschewing big franchises and cultivating fresh film-makers. Most of the debut fiction features this year are directed by women. One buzzy title, “Drift”, stars Cynthia Erivo as a Liberian exile. The documentary slate includes “A Still Small Voice”, a sensitive portrait of a palliative-care worker. But after the prestigious premieres, these films will face a question familiar to moviegoers: what next?

## Weekend profile: Matteo Messina Denaro, captured mafioso

“Kind, very kind” was how a fellow patient remembered the man she knew as Andrea Bonafede. In a television interview, the woman described how he had befriended her while they were undergoing chemotherapy at the Maddalena hospital in Palermo, Sicily. “Andrea”, whose colon cancer was spreading to his liver, had swapped telephone numbers not just with her but with some of her girlfriends. Then on Monday he was arrested, identified as Italy’s most wanted man, Matteo Messina Denaro, and accused of some of the most appalling crimes in Italy’s recent history. 

Nicknamed <em>U Siccu</em> (the skinny one) and more sinisterly as<em> Diabolik</em>, Mr Messina Denaro was among the Sicilian Mafia bosses who felt themselves so powerful in the early 1990s that they could take on the state. He was a leading ally of the Corleonesi clan, which originated in the market town of Corleone and which wrested control of Cosa Nostra with a campaign of unparalleled savagery. It was he and his friends who planted the bombs that killed the anti-Mafia prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino and who mounted a campaign of terror attacks to try to bend the government of the day to their will.

Mr Messina Denaro had the reputation of a playboy—elegant and with a taste for fast cars and attractive women. Indeed. The police found that “Mr Bonafede’s” watch was worth €35,000 ($37,800). His fellow patient noted that, even in the torrid heat of a Sicilian summer, “Andrea” always arrived at the hospital in a formal, long-sleeved shirt.

For many years it was assumed that he had succeeded the Corleonesi’s leader, [Salvatore Riina](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2017/06/08/italy-struggles-to-deal-with-an-aged-godfather), as “Boss of Bosses”. But the latest view is that, while a symbol of the Mafia’s ability to defy the law, he was never more than the kingpin in his native province of Trapani. Still, the significance of Mr Messina Denaro’s arrest is that he was the last of those bosses still at large more than 30 years later. His capture sends a powerful message that the state always wins, eventually.
