The<strong> Federal Reserve</strong> raised its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point. That follows four consecutive three-quarter-point increases and brings the federal-funds rate to a range between 4.25% and 4.5%, its [highest since 2007](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/14/to-fix-americas-inflation-problem-the-federal-reserve-must-go-big). Policymakers’ median forecast is that interest rates will hit 5.1% in 2023, and that American GDP will grow by 0.5% next year.

Istanbul’s mayor, <strong>Ekrem Imamoglu</strong>, was sentenced to two years and seven months in prison for insulting the elections authority. The conviction could prevent the [rising star](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2019/06/24/the-oppositions-new-star-deals-turkeys-president-a-stinging-blow) of Turkey’s secular opposition party from being reelected as mayor of the country’s largest city. It could also block a possible [challenge](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/turkeys-centenary-could-mark-the-end-of-the-erdogan-era) to the incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdogan in next year’s presidential election.

An energy deal worth nearly $16bn was announced between <strong>Vietnam</strong> and rich countries, including America, Britain and Germany, to help transition its economy away from <strong>coal</strong>. Similar [partnerships](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/17/there-is-a-better-way-to-help-poor-countries-fight-climate-change) have already been signed with South Africa and [Indonesia](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/11/16/indonesias-tilt-at-king-coal). To access the cash, Vietnam has to promise to reach a peak in its emissions by 2030 and use more renewable energy.

<strong>Peru’s</strong> government declared a 30-day state of emergency to quell protests by supporters of Pedro Castillo, the former president whom lawmakers removed from office after he attempted to [dissolve the legislature](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/12/07/after-a-bungled-coup-attempt-perus-president-falls). The order gives more authority to police and the army, allowing them to search homes without warrants, for example. Prosecutors are seeking to detain Mr Castillo for 18 months while he awaits trial.

<strong>Four migrants</strong> died attempting the short but dangerous journey across the [English Channel](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2021/12/01/can-britain-stop-migrants-crossing-the-channel). Another 43 people were saved, mostly pulled out from the freezing waters. The accident comes a day after Britain’s prime minister, <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong>, promised to boost staffing to deal with a growing backlog of asylum claims. More than 40,000 people have set out to cross the channel in [small boats](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/11/02/why-small-boats-are-a-big-problem-for-britain) so far this year.

<strong>Iran</strong> was ousted from a UN committee tasked with promoting gender equality and empowering <strong>women. </strong>The country was voted out of the commission on the status of women over its suppression of protesters, many of whom are female, taking part in recent [anti-government rallies](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/12/08/protest-movements-as-deadly-as-irans-often-end-in-revolution-or-civil-war). The motion to do so was presented by America at the behest of Iranian activists.

<strong>Football World Cup</strong>: France ended [Morocco’s](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/13/moroccos-world-cup-success-sparks-a-debate-about-arab-identity) historic World Cup run, winning 2-0 in the semi-final. France, the defending champion, will play Argentina for the trophy on Sunday.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>70%, the share of electricity generation in France produced by nuclear reactors, the highest in the world. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/12/12/can-the-french-nuclear-industry-avoid-meltdown).

## The Fed downshifts to a slower rate rise

Wednesday marked the start of a new phase in the Federal Reserve’s battle against inflation. After four consecutive [interest-rate increases](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/02/the-fed-delivers-another-jumbo-rate-rise-and-its-far-from-done) of 0.75 percentage points, America’s central bank opted for half a point at its December meeting. 

In part that reflects the Fed’s confidence that [inflation is easing](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/12/07/inflation-is-falling-but-not-enough). Data released on Tuesday showed the core consumer-price index rose by just 0.2% in November. But there are two crucial caveats. First, it takes a long time for rate changes to filter through the economy. The combined impact of the past year’s tightening will only show up next year. The risk of a recession will grow even as rate increases get smaller.

Second, the Fed has been at pains to insist that it will keep rates elevated for as long as is needed to bring inflation to heel. A slowdown in rate increases does not equate to an easing of monetary policy.

## A crackdown in Bangladesh

On Wednesday Bangladesh will mark the anniversary of the murder, by a militia controlled by the Pakistani army, of intellectuals just before the end of the war of independence in 1971. The shadow of that [conflict](https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2017/03/28/virtual-revenge-is-sweet-in-bangladesh) looms large in Bangladesh. The prime minister, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, whose party, the Awami League, led the independence struggle, faces demands from the opposition for her resignation. She in turn accuses the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party of favouring Pakistan. 

The real issues, claims the BNP, are the poor state of the economy and Sheikh Hasina’s authoritarian tendencies. In recent weeks the party has been holding massive protests, capitalising on public anger about slowing economic growth and surging inflation. It regards the conviction and jailing on corruption charges of its leader, [​​Khaleda Zia](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2018/02/08/the-conviction-of-khaleda-zia-hobbles-bangladeshs-opposition), a former prime minister, as political persecution. 

The government has cracked down hard on the protests. Several thousand BNP activists have been arrested, many on charges of inciting violence. Elections are not due until January 2024. There is no sign that tensions will ease before then.

## Better news for Germany’s economy

On Wednesday the Ifo Institute, a think-tank in Munich, published its quarterly economic forecast for Germany. It was less gloomy than the last one, published in September. The institute suggested that an impending recession will be less severe than it had previously expected. The Ifo now forecasts that the German economy will contract by 0.1% in 2023, compared with earlier forecast of a 0.3% decline. In a separate survey conducted in November, Ifo found that business confidence has been buoyed as Germany filled all of its storage facilities for [natural gas](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/12/01/meet-the-man-who-may-decide-the-fate-of-german-industry), even though no Russian gas has arrived since September, easing panic about soaring energy costs. 

The rate of inflation may have already peaked which should mean that, after a steep fall, households’ real incomes can rise again. Germany’s politicians will hope that increased consumer spending will provide the motor of recovery in the second half of next year. But they cannot be [complacent](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/10/13/europe-is-growing-complacent-about-its-energy-crisis). Energy shortages, and high prices, could return [next winter](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/29/europes-next-energy-crunch). 

## Travel operators hope for a happier 2023

As Europe shivers through a cold snap, travel operators will hope that winter-weary consumers book big plans for next summer. After three years of pandemic restrictions and [labour shortages](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/07/travel-chaos-in-europe-is-a-glimpse-of-a-future-with-few-spare-workers), the industry is trying to return to normal. An early sign of progress came on Wednesday, when TUI, a German travel operator, reported its latest results. The firm announced its first quarterly profit since the [start of the pandemic](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/14/take-that-covid-revenge-tourism-takes-off), with guest numbers back to 93% of pre-pandemic levels over the summer.

TUI says it is “optimistic” about the year ahead, noting that early bookings for next summer are up on last year. But [high inflation](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/31/europe-is-heading-for-recession-how-bad-will-it-be) and rising interest rates mean less spending money, and could yet stem the flow of bookings. And a group of more than 500 British holidaymakers are suing the company after an outbreak of gastric illness spoiled their summer get-aways this year. Uncertainty still clouds the skies.

## One step closer to controlled fusion power

America’s energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, announced on Tuesday that the country’s National Ignition Facility (NIF) had lived up to the “I” in its name, by [achieving ignition](https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2022/12/13/controlled-fusion-power-is-little-nearer-now-than-it-was-a-week-ago). 

The stuff ignited was some pellets of a frozen mixture of deuterium and tritium—isotopes of hydrogen. “Ignition” means that NIF, which creates fusion in such pellets by bombarding them simultaneously with 192 laser beams, had started a reaction which released more energy than was put into the pellet by the beams. 

Ms Granholm made a great fuss about that. But the huge amount of energy required to generate the beams in the first place (which did not form part of the headline calculation) means this approach is not even close to yielding a route to civil fusion power. Since NIF’s main job is military (the understanding of hydrogen bombs) that does not directly matter. But if civil fusion does come about, it is unlikely to be done in this way.
