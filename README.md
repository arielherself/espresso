<strong>OPEC</strong> and its allies, including <strong>Russia</strong>, agreed to cut oil production in an effort to boost sagging prices. The reduction of output by 100,000 barrels per day corresponds to just 0.1% of global demand. European <strong>gas prices</strong> rose dramatically on Monday morning as markets reacted to <strong>Russia’s </strong>indefinite suspension of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. On Friday Gazprom, Russia’s state-owned gas supplier, halted flows through the pipeline for an unspecified period, implausibly citing a technical fault.

<strong>Kenya’s</strong> Supreme Court upheld the result of the presidential election of August 9th, won narrowly by <strong>William Ruto</strong>. The court heard several petitions from allies of the defeated candidate, Raila Odinga, contesting the result. But the chief justice, Martha Koome, dismissed all allegations of ballot-stuffing, voter suppression and tampering with the results. Some of the evidence submitted to the court was “hot air”, she argued, sending the court on a “wild goose chase”.

<strong>Liz Truss</strong> will replace Boris Johnson as Britain’s <strong>prime minister</strong>, after she was elected as leader of the Conservative Party. [Ms Truss](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/05/what-kind-of-prime-minister-will-liz-truss-be), the foreign secretary, beat Rishi Sunak, a former chancellor of the exchequer, in a ballot of about 170,000 [party members](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/07/26/britains-tories-are-overwhelmingly-male-pale-and-stale), winning 57% of 140,000 votes cast. The new prime minister, a self-proclaimed Thatcherite, inherits a perilous economic situation amid record energy prices and a cost-of-living crisis.

Israel admitted that there is a “high possibility” that <strong>Shireen Abu Aqleh</strong>, a Palestinian journalist who [died](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/05/14/shireen-abu-aqleh-was-killed-covering-an-israeli-raid) in the West Bank in May, was killed “accidently” by its army. But the military said it was impossible to definitively determine how the Al Jazeera correspondent died, arguing that Palestinian fighters were also in the area. The UN’s human rights office had previously concluded that Ms Abu Aqleh was killed by Israeli fire.

<strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said that his country’s troops had made steady progress in their [counter-offensive](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/04/ukraine-is-losing-fewer-soldiers-in-its-counter-offensive-than-russia-claims) against occupying Russian forces in the east and south. But he warned Europe to expect a “difficult winter” of [high fuel prices](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/01/how-to-prevent-europes-energy-crunch-spiralling-into-an-economic-crisis). Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said he was expecting €5bn ($5bn) in aid from the European Union this week, partly to help Ukrainians through the winter. On a trip to Berlin he also solicited Germany for more heavy weapons and air defence systems. 

A <strong>suicide bombing</strong> outside Russia’s embassy in <strong>Kabul</strong> killed six people, including two embassy staff. Russia is one of the only countries to have maintained a diplomatic mission in Afghanistan since the Taliban’s takeover [one year ago](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/11/afghanistan-is-poorer-and-hungrier-than-a-year-ago). Violence including suicide bombings, has decreased since the hardline Islamist group retook power. No organisation has yet claimed responsibility for the explosion.

Voters in <strong>Chile</strong> [rejected](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/09/05/common-sense-triumphs-as-chileans-reject-a-new-constitution) a <strong>new constitution</strong> intended to replace the one passed in 1980 under the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. The [proposed constitution](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/07/07/chiles-new-draft-constitution-would-shift-the-country-far-to-the-left) would have enshrined costly new socio-economic rights, such as requiring a universal state-run health system. But Chileans are currently more concerned about inflation and rising crime. With nearly all votes counted, around 62% opposed the change.

## Britain’s new prime minister

On Monday Britain’s Conservative Party announced that following a ballot of its 170,000-odd members, its new leader is Liz Truss, the current foreign secretary. Ms Truss won 57% of 140,000 votes cast, a smaller than expected majority, to defeat Rishi Sunak, a former chancellor of the exchequer. She will thus become prime minister on Tuesday.

Ms Truss promises a big pivot in economic policy, with a package of deficit-funded tax cuts and a big hike to defence spending. She is not concerned that her proposals benefit the wealthiest. A focus on distributional effects over growth is to blame for Britain’s low growth, she reasons. It is a political gamble: this winter, Britons will see their energy bills jump as a result of a [Europe-wide energy crunch](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/01/how-to-prevent-europes-energy-crunch-spiralling-into-an-economic-crisis). While instinctively averse to what she calls “handouts”, on Sunday Ms Truss nonetheless promised that within a week of taking office she would offer a package of help for people [struggling to pay their bills](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/08/26/energy-bills-in-britain-are-soaring). Tories may delight in her small-state instincts, but most Britons expect something big, and fast.

## Inflation nation

[Turkey’s economy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/07/21/how-has-turkeys-economy-kept-growing-despite-raging-inflation) grew by an eye-watering 7.6% in the three months to July, compared with the same period last year. So much for the good news. While many businesses, especially exporters whose revenue comes in the form of foreign currency, have reaped the rewards of absurdly low interest rates, wage-earners are struggling. The lira has lost 27% of its value against the dollar since the start of the year, and nearly 70% since 2020. The annual inflation rate rose to 80.2% in August, according to new data released on Monday.

Galloping prices are one reason for the unusually high growth figures. To [hedge against inflation](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/07/21/how-has-turkeys-economy-kept-growing-despite-raging-inflation), middle-class Turks have been spending their earnings and savings on consumer goods, bringing forward purchases they may not be able to afford later. That is hardly a model for sustainable growth. A slowdown is imminent. 

## Kenya’s disputed election

Kenya’s presidential election, held on August 9th, looked like one of the most transparent in the country’s history. Not according to Raila Odinga, the loser, who says a convoluted conspiracy deprived him of victory. On Monday Kenya’s supreme court ruled that his allegations did not merit a new election. Judges dismissed Mr Odinga’s claims that the electoral commission’s servers were hacked to alter results in favour of his rival, William Ruto, the outgoing deputy president, who barely [won](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/18/william-ruto-is-declared-kenyas-next-president) enough votes to avoid a run-off. Chief Justice Martha Koome dismissed key arguments from Odinga’s lawyers as being based on “nothing more than hot air.”

Kenyan judges are among Africa’s most independent. In 2017, amid claims of vote-rigging, they ordered a rerun of the last presidential election. Another rerun would have tested Kenya. In anticipation of the court’s ruling police were on standby for unrest.

## Cristina Fernández de Kirchner in the dock

Last Thursday a man [tried to assassinate](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/09/02/cristina-fernandez-argentinas-vice-president-is-attacked) Cristina Fernández de Kirchner as she was heading back to her apartment (the gun failed to fire). He emerged from a mob of supporters who had spent days clustered on the pavement to demonstrate their support for the former president and current vice-president as she faces corruption charges.

On Monday her [court case](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/08/25/argentinas-vice-president-could-face-12-years-in-prison) begins. It will hear the defences of 13 people accused of corruption, including Ms Fernández. She is accused of leading a criminal operation between 2003 and 2015 which involved doling out inflated public works contracts to a friend at the cost of around $1bn to the state. The scheme is alleged to have begun during the presidency of Néstor Kirchner, Ms Fernández’s deceased husband, and carried on under her two terms in office. A prosecutor has requested that Ms Fernández be jailed for 12 years and barred from public office (Ms Fernández denies all allegations). If she loses and appeals, the case could wind on for years.

## English football clubs look to conquer Europe

Europe’s elite football competitions kick off this week. Over the past ten seasons English clubs have won the Champions League, Europe’s most prestigious tournament, only twice. Yet this season Manchester City—bolstered by the signing of Erling Haaland, Norway’s prolific striker—are the bookies’ favourite, and other English clubs are in the running too. For while football in the rest of Europe is still reeling from the pandemic, the English Premier League is in robust health. During the summer transfer window, which shut on September 1st, clubs [spent a record €2.24bn ($2.23bn](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/09/02/footballs-transfer-window-shows-the-premier-leagues-growing-clout)) on new signings. That was close to the combined outlay by clubs in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Despite winning the league last season, Manchester City spent some €139m, targeting the Champions League, the one trophy that has eluded the club

English extravagance has been driven by the Premier League’s growing revenues. Thanks to a new lucrative international broadcast deal, its clubs are expected to rake in more than €7bn this season, nearly twice as much as their counterparts in Spain, the next richest league. Financial clout does not guarantee footballing glory, but it certainly helps.
