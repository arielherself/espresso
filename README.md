A day after <strong>Ukraine</strong> and <strong>Russia</strong> had [signed a deal](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/22/after-agreeing-to-let-ukraine-export-grain-russia-rockets-its-port) to resume grain exports from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, Russian missiles hit Odessa, the biggest of those ports. A Ukrainian foreign-ministry spokesman accused Vladimir Putin of “spitting in the face” of the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, and Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who brokered the agreement. The attack breaks the conditions of the deal and could already signal its demise.

The World Health Organisation declared <strong>monkeypox</strong> [a global health emergency](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/06/23/is-monkeypox-an-international-public-health-emergency). More than 16,000 cases of the viral illness have been reported this year. The alert, the WHO’s highest, was last used in January 2020 with SARS-CoV-2. It is meant to spur countries to establish a spur countries to mount a co-ordinated, international response. Although monkeypox [rarely kills healthy adults](https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2022/05/25/the-spread-of-monkeypox), it can be dangerous for children, pregnant women and immunocompromised people.

The Biden administration authorised another <strong>weapons</strong> delivery to <strong>Ukraine,</strong> worth $270m. An American official said that hundreds of Russian soldiers are dying each day in the war; earlier the CIA estimated that 15,000 had been killed so far. Separately, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, told the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> that he would not countenance any [ceasefire](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/05/26/when-and-how-might-the-war-in-ukraine-end) that let Russia retain territory it had taken.

<strong>Google</strong> has sacked a software engineer, Blake Lemoine, who last month shared his belief that [LaMDA](https://te.arielherself.xyz/by-invitation/2022/06/09/artificial-neural-networks-are-making-strides-towards-consciousness-according-to-blaise-aguera-y-arcas), the company’s chatbot, had become “[sentient](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/06/14/could-artificial-intelligence-become-sentient)” with the <em>Washington Post</em>. He said that, without knowing better, he’d think he was talking to “a seven-year-old, eight-year-old kid that happens to know physics”. Google dismissed Mr Lemoine’s claims as unfounded and said his behaviour violated the company’s employment and data-security policies.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

The UN’s top court ruled that a case accusing <strong>Myanmar</strong> of committing <strong>genocide</strong> against Rohingya Muslims can continue, striking down objections from the country’s ruling military junta. The International Court of Justice will now try to establish how responsible the state was for the violence that caused hundreds of thousands of [Rohingyas to flee](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2021/10/09/a-rohingya-leaders-murder-highlights-rising-insecurity-in-refugee-camps). 

<strong>Cuba’s</strong> parliament announced that [the country](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/03/26/cubas-dictatorship-has-a-cultural-opposition-that-it-cant-tolerate) will hold a referendum on <strong>legalising same-sex marriage</strong> and surrogate parenthood. The National Assembly approved an update to Cuba’s family law, which would also allow same-sex couples to adopt children and strengthen legal protections for children and the elderly. The public will now vote on the matter on September 25th. 

Xinjiang, a region in the far west of <strong>China</strong>, was warned that it faced flash floods, mudslides and risks to agriculture amid forecasts of more <strong>unusually high temperatures</strong> in the coming days. Some 20% of the world’s cotton is produced in the area. Since mid-June much of China has baked under [brutal heatwaves](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/07/20/todays-heatwaves-are-a-warning-of-worse-to-come), which are attributed to climate change. 

<strong>Word of the week:</strong> <em>lanweilou</em>, a Chinese term for unfinished buildings. Across China people are halting mortgage payments on such homes to protest construction delays.

## A deal for Ukraine’s grain

The deal comes not a moment too soon. On Saturday the world will be watching to see if an agreement struck by Ukraine and Russia to resume grain exports from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports will stick. If it does, the accord should ease [world hunger](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/05/19/the-coming-food-catastrophe)—50m people are on the brink of starvation, warns the UN—and inflation. Indeed, wheat prices fell by 6% on the news.

The pact creates a “joint co-ordination centre” in Istanbul, staffed by the belligerents as well as Turkey and the UN. It will monitor cargo ships transiting through Ukrainian ports, and inspect them for weapons.

But the limited agreement, which comes up for renewal every 120 days, will [not solve the food crisis](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/22/russia-and-ukraine-agree-to-reopen-odessa-easing-a-food-crisis). Grain prices are down by one-third from their peak earlier this year, but the stuff is still more than 40% dearer than in January 2020. And as the war is [likely to go on for months](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/06/30/how-to-win-ukraines-long-war), no one knows if the deal will hold. Indeed, many wonder if it is too good to be true. After all, Russia is not known for keeping to its word in Ukraine.

## Manifesta comes to Kosovo

In 1996, when the first edition of Manifesta took place in Rotterdam, the territories of the former Yugoslavia were at war. This week the 14th iteration opens in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo—making it the first city in the western Balkans to host Europe’s nomadic art biennial. Derelict urban sites have been cleared and tidied into new public spaces. Brutalist structures associated with the Yugoslav era, including the Grand Hotel and Palace of Youth and Sports, have been reimagined as exhibition venues.

Of the 103 participating artists, over one-third are Kosovar and another quarter come from the rest of the western Balkans. This is an unusually regional focus for an international art event. That reflects the organisers’ commitment to the local art scene, but also acknowledges its isolation. Citizens of Kosovo wishing to enter the European Union must tackle a lengthy and expensive visa-application process. The country’s artists thus struggle to participate in the international art scene. Instead, Manifesta is bringing Europe’s art professionals to Kosovo.

## Why human egg cells don’t spoil

Which came first, the chicken or the egg? For humans, both come at once: baby girls are born with all of the egg cells (or “oocytes”) they will ever have. Decades later, they must still be capable of spawning new life. This remarkable ability is little understood. But new research in <em>Nature</em>, a journal, has unpicked the secret of egg cells’ longevity. Essentially, oocytes put themselves into a state of dormancy by suppressing normal cell metabolism.

Metabolism powers cells, but in doing so produces certain volatile chemicals. These mutate DNA and eventually kill cells. However, oocytes keep their engines running at such a low hum that they produce precious few of these dangerous chemicals. It is as if they are left on standby—for up to 40 or 50 years. This insight could improve success rates in assisted reproduction. Moreover, it highlights how shamefully understudied egg cells are. After all, everybody started out as one.

## Thailand’s prime minister wins another confidence vote

]Politics has a habit of repeating itself in Thailand. Opposition parties had already attempted to oust Prayuth Chan-ocha, the prime minister, in votes of confidence three times since his party was elected in 2019. (Mr Prayuth initially [seized power in a military coup](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/06/16/thailands-military-ruler-is-on-the-back-foot) five years before.) Last Tuesday the opposition began debating yet another motion of no-confidence, and the vote took place on Saturday. Parliamentarians accused Mr Prayuth and ten members of his cabinet of economic mismanagement and of tolerating corruption in government.

But Mr Prayuth survived the vote, just as he has all the others. This is not a surprise: his coalition controls 253 parliamentary seats, 14 more than the number needed to win. Even before the result, Mr Prayuth denied any possibility of a cabinet reshuffle. Now, Mr Prayuth’s rivals will turn their focus to the elections that must be held before next March, and will seize every opportunity to smear their opponent until then. 

## Weekend profile: the climatologists transforming how we discuss weather

“People don’t have to die in their tens of thousands,” says Friederike Otto, with a touch of exasperation. In 2014 Dr Otto co-founded the World Weather Attribution (WWA) initiative, a collective of climate researchers and statisticians that has transformed the understanding of extreme weather events, such as the remarkable [trio of heatwaves](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/07/19/the-increase-in-simultaneous-heatwaves) that hit Europe, China and America this week. 

The idea was born of frustration with the academic distinction between climate and weather. “Climate” denotes macro, long-term trends; “weather” is what’s going on outside your window. Most people are more interested in daily weather patterns than decadal or even longer-term patterns. In the 2010s a group of researchers decided that to make the world understand why climate change mattered, they needed to introduce it into conversations about the weather, including the forecasts people see on television. 

Thus was the WWA conceived. The group works with the Red Cross Red Crescent’s Climate Centre, which gathers data on the number of people affected by any given climate event. If the number passes a certain threshold, Dr Otto and her collaborators, Sjoukje Philip and Sarah Kew of the Dutch meteorology institute, activate the WWA community. They canvass “everyone we know” to form an ad-hoc group of expert modellers. The exercise is, on the face of it, simple: to simulate two atmospheres, one with all the accumulated greenhouse-gas emissions of the last two centuries, and one that is unsullied. By comparing these two worlds, they can say whether a specific event is more or less likely to happen in a climate-changed atmosphere. 

This has led to headline-grabbing statements: that the [northern European floods last year](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2021/08/23/climate-change-made-north-west-europes-lethal-flood-more-likely) were made up to nine times more likely by anthropogenic climate change, the [Siberian heatwave of 2020](https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2020/07/15/siberias-heatwave-would-not-have-happened-without-climate-change) was many thousand times more likely, and the [Pacific Northwest heatwave](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2021/06/29/why-are-the-north-western-united-states-and-british-columbia-suffering-a-heatwave) of 2021 would have been virtually impossible without historical emissions. Such statements, and the underlying methodology, are now part of the climate vernacular. They are also applied elsewhere, such as in legal disputes where people or communities [seek compensation for climate-change-induced damages](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/04/23/lawsuits-aimed-at-greenhouse-gas-emissions-are-a-growing-trend). 

Extreme heat is one of the most straightforward impacts of global warming, and virtually every contemporary heatwave was made [worse or more likely by emissions](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/07/20/todays-heatwaves-are-a-warning-of-worse-to-come), or both. But Dr Otto worries that this engenders fatalism. “Yes it’s climate change…but we are also not powerless to do something about it,” she says. “That…is what’s missing in the conversation.”
