<strong>Russia </strong>announced plans for a series of [referendums ](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/25/ukraine-and-russia-both-need-more-soldiers)to formally annex four separatist-ruled regions of <strong>Ukraine</strong>. Russian-installed officials in Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhia, which make up 15% of Ukrainian territory, said residents would vote on joining Russia between September 23rd and 27th. America immediately said it would not recognise the results; Ukraine’s foreign minister called the move a “sham”. On Tuesday evening <strong>Vladimir Putin,</strong> Russia’s president, had been expected to give his first televised address since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, but failed to appear.

The lower house of <strong>Russia’s </strong>parliament passed a bill mandating harsher penalties for desertion and refusal to fight—for the first time including crimes committed during “mobilisation, martial law and wartime”. The bill could be approved by the upper house as early as Wednesday. Mr Putin urgently needs more [manpower](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/25/ukraine-and-russia-both-need-more-soldiers) for his [flagging campaign](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/15/vladimir-putins-war-is-failing-the-west-should-help-it-fail-faster) in <strong>Ukraine</strong>. Russian paratroopers stationed in Syria will be transferred to the frontline, the <em>Kyiv Independent</em> reported.

World leaders met in <strong>New York</strong> at the <strong>UN General Assembly</strong>, the annual UN summit, held in person for the first time in three years. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s president, was the first head of state to deliver his address. Participants at the summit face a daunting list of challenges; António Guterres, the UN’s secretary-general, said there should be “no illusions” about the difficulties ahead.

Protests erupted across <strong>Iran </strong>over the death of a young Kurdish woman, <strong>Mahsa Amini</strong>, who died in police custody last week after being arrested for wearing her hijab incorrectly. In Iran’s Kurdistan province security forces opened fire on demonstrators. At least four were killed, according to a rights group, while another 85 were injured and 200 arrested. During the protests some women have been burning their [headscarves](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2018/03/08/why-iranian-women-are-taking-off-their-veils).

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

Violence broke out in the <strong>West Bank</strong> towns of Nablus and Jenin between security forces of the [Palestinian Authority](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/23/the-ageing-ailing-palestinian-leader-does-not-do-much-governing) and supporters of the Islamist group Hamas. On Monday troops of the Palestinian Authority, which is controlled by Hamas’s rival, Fatah, entered Nablus and arrested Musab Shtayyeh, a Hamas commander wanted by Israel, which insists the PA must do more to crack down on militants.

<strong>Hurricane Fiona</strong> made landfall in the <strong>Dominican Republic</strong>. Torrential rain and winds of 90mph (145kph) forced roads and businesses to close in the east of the Caribbean country. The hurricane is forecast to strengthen as it travels towards the Turks and Caicos Islands. Over the weekend the storm battered neighbouring <strong>Puerto Rico</strong>, killing several people, cutting off power to 1.3m of [the territory’s](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2021/11/20/puerto-rico-success-story) residents and leaving 70% without potable water.

<strong>China</strong> kept its benchmark <strong>lending rates </strong>unchanged—despite the yuan’s weakening in recent weeks and central banks’ tightening monetary policy elsewhere. Officials decided not to increase one- and five-year loan prime rates as they try to find a balance between supporting an [economic recovery](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/08/18/chinas-economy-is-beset-by-problems) and bolstering the yuan.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>94%, Egypt’s ratio of debt-to-GDP. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/15/from-tea-to-cars-egypt-and-tunisia-struggle-to-pay-for-imports).

## World leaders assemble at the UN

A day after one gathering of world leaders in London, at [Elizabeth II’s funeral](https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2022/09/16/for-a-last-moment-the-queen-is-everywhere), another is under way in New York on Tuesday, at the UN General Assembly. The leaders’ annual debate has resumed fully in person, after two years of covid-related disruption. But the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis and climate-related disasters mean this will hardly be a happy reunion.

Joe Biden will address the assembly on Wednesday. In 2019 Donald Trump told the UN that “the future does not belong to globalists”. Last year Mr Biden reassured fellow leaders that America was “back at the table in international forums”. But since then divisions between the great powers have deepened; last week Mr Biden felt compelled to warn Vladimir Putin against using [chemical](https://te.arielherself.xyz/news/2022/03/11/could-russia-use-chemical-weapons-in-ukraine) or [nuclear weapons](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/14/do-russias-military-setbacks-increase-the-risk-of-nuclear-conflict) in Ukraine. And the ravages of the pandemic have held back progress in health, education and standards of living for two consecutive years, playing havoc with the UN’s agenda—not least its sustainable-development goals.

## Japan keeps cool on inflation

Japan overshot its official inflation target for the fifth month in a row, figures released on Tuesday show. [Core consumer prices](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/18/prices-are-rising-in-japan-but-not-wages), which exclude fresh food, increased by 2.8% year-on-year in August; the Bank of Japan’s target is 2%. Yet the central bank reckons demand is still too weak, and wage growth too slow, to worry excessively about sustained inflation. Kuroda Haruhiko, the governor, has signalled that the bank will maintain its loose monetary stance at its policy meeting later this week.

If so, that will leave the BoJ even further [out of step](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/06/23/the-bank-of-japan-v-the-markets) with other rich-world central banks. Most of them are [racing to tighten policy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/14/to-fix-americas-inflation-problem-the-federal-reserve-must-go-big) in the face of stubbornly high inflation. The growing gap in yields is one reason why the [Japanese yen](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/will-an-ever-feebler-currency-save-or-sink-japans-economy/21809095) has fallen below 140 per US dollar, its lowest rate in more than two decades. Expect even more of a tumble.

## Legal weed struggles to turn a profit

Canada legalised recreational marijuana in 2018 in the hope that a [thriving cannabis industry](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2018/07/05/canadas-cannabis-firms-plot-world-domination) would replace drug-smuggling gangs. Better quality-control and labelling of doses were to make for safer highs. Prices of regulated and unregulated marijuana in Canada are slowly converging. But black-market suppliers, who neither pay taxes nor abide by stringent regulations, have retained their edge: cost remains the single most important factor in choosing a source for most buyers.

That is an issue for Aurora Cannabis, one of Canada’s largest pot producers, which is expected to report more losses on Tuesday. Since March 2019 the company’s share price has tumbled from more than C$150 (US$113) to below C$2. Investors will be inspecting the company’s decision last month to buy Bevo Farms, a producer of vegetables and houseplants. And sentiment around legal cannabis will largely depend on regulators: as America’s senate backtracks on a bill to decriminalise cannabis, Germany—with a potential market estimated at $16.6bn—is mulling legalisation.

## Argentina’s economy grows amid woes

On Tuesday Argentina is expected to report that its economy expanded by more than 6% in the second quarter of the year. The war in Ukraine has pushed up prices for soy and wheat, both of which the country has in bountiful supply. But other woes are abundant in South America’s second-largest economy: annual inflation could reach 100% by the end of the year. The country owes the IMF more than $40bn, but has scarce foreign reserves. In July Argentina’s [economy minister resigned](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/07/07/argentinas-economy-minister-resigns-because-of-political-infighting), citing political infighting among his superiors. His replacement was sacked three weeks into the job.

But the latest incumbent, Sergio Massa, has offered more hope since taking over in August. An experienced operator, Mr Massa promises to reduce the fiscal deficit, as agreed with the [IMF](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/01/29/the-imf-cannot-solve-argentinas-dysfunction), and to stop the money-printing that has fuelled inflation. Yet with pressure from some in government to increase welfare spending, Mr Massa faces a difficult balancing act.

## 50 years on, “The Joy of Sex” endures

When Alex Comfort first published his famous sex manual in 1972, its success stemmed from its reassuring tone: “The Joy of Sex” counselled that there was nothing deviant about desire. At a time when [sex](https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2018/11/30/a-very-short-history-of-sexuality) was widely considered sinful in the Anglophone world, [“The Joy of Sex” ](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/09/20/the-joy-of-sex-is-a-book-for-the-ages)stood apart for its relaxed, approachable prose and its emphasis on pleasure. Mr Comfort wanted to do for sex what “The Joy of Cooking” had done for food: teach readers about the basics, and provide a “gourmet guide” for those seeking further satisfaction. (Try bondage, he suggested, a “wild sexual sensation”.)

Though groundbreaking for its time, parts of the book may now seem nauseating. “Don’t get yourself raped,” he advised his female audience. A revised edition has since omitted some offensive references, but the core of the book has endured. Good sex was not possible without love, Mr Comfort argued, and that meant “mutual tenderness, respect and consideration”. That is still a recipe worth learning.
