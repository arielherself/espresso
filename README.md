<strong>Germany’s </strong>defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said that the 14 [Leopard tanks](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2023/01/25/what-makes-germanys-leopard-2-tank-the-best-fit-for-ukraine) it has promised to <strong>Ukraine</strong> will arrive in “late March, early April”. <strong>America</strong> is also sending 31 <strong>Abrams tanks</strong>. President Joe Biden announced a $400m package that includes eight M88 recovery vehicles, which can tow the Abrams. Germany’s [move](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/01/25/nato-members-are-right-to-send-tanks-to-ukraine)—taken after much dithering—allows Poland and other countries to export their German-made Leopards. Ukraine is now hoping the West gives it fighter jets, but Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, insisted that there is no chance of that happening. Meanwhile, Russia launched a mass air raid on Ukraine during the morning rush hour.

<strong>America’s economy</strong> slowed slightly to an annual growth rate of 2.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022, down from 3.2% in the third quarter, according to early figures from the US Commerce Department. The world’s biggest economy beat market expectations despite rising interest rates eroding business activity—but a [recession](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/01/26/the-world-economys-inflation-problem-is-easing) in the second half of the year still looks likely.

Sayfullo Saipov, an Islamist extremist who [killed](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2017/11/02/new-york-is-attacked-again-but-remains-remarkably-safe) eight people driving a truck on a <strong>Manhattan</strong> bike path in 2017, was convicted of 28 federal charges. He could face the <strong>death penalty</strong>, a rare consideration in New York. America’s attorney-general issued a [moratorium](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2021/01/21/use-of-the-death-penalty-in-america-may-be-ending) on federal executions, but allowed prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case. 

<strong>Russia</strong> outlawed one of the largest independent Russian-language news websites, <strong>Meduza</strong>, as part of the government’s media crackdown. Prosecutors said the site, which has been critical of the war in Ukraine, was “undesirable” and a threat to the country’s security. Meduza was established [in Latvia](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/03/10/russians-are-trying-to-escape-online-censorship) in 2014; it was blocked by Russia in March but continued to post on Telegram, where it has more than 1.2m subscribers.

<strong>Israeli troops</strong> killed nine <strong>Palestinians</strong> and wounded multiple others during a [military raid](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/05/14/shireen-abu-aqleh-was-killed-covering-an-israeli-raid) on Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, according to Palestinian health officials. Israeli forces said they were targeting Islamic militants plotting “major” attacks. It is the deadliest such single incident in years. Over 170 Palestinians were killed in raids in 2022, as part of what Israel calls an anti-terrorism offensive.

<strong>France</strong> recalled its ambassador to <strong>Burkina Faso</strong> a day after agreeing to withdraw troops from the country. 400 French troops were fighting an ongoing [Islamist insurgency](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/01/for-the-second-time-this-year-soldiers-stage-a-coup-in-burkina-faso), but Burkina Faso’s government says it wants to defend itself. France has also fallen out with other African allies—after more than nine years in 2022 its [soldiers left neighbouring Mali](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/08/19/france-has-withdrawn-its-final-troops-from-mali) without having completed their mission.

Opium production in <strong>Myanmar</strong> jumped to a nine-year high, reversing a downward trend, according to the UN. Production has roughly doubled from the previous year, when [the military junta](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2023/01/12/myanmars-generals-are-deeply-superstitious) seized power, to nearly 795 tonnes in 2022. Opium poppy cultivation increased by a third, while the potential yield rose by 88%. Myanmar’s civil war and covid pandemic have put its [frail economy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/09/15/an-economically-illiterate-junta-is-running-myanmar-into-the-ground) in a tailspin.

## America’s economy stays strong (for now)

The American economy ended 2022 on a high note. Early figures published on Thursday showed that GDP in the final three months of the year expanded at an annualised rate of about 2.9%, slightly higher than economists&#x27; expectations. That marks America’s second straight quarter of robust growth, [defying predictions of a recession](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/the-american-economy-is-set-for-a-downturn-not-a-crisis)—at least for now. A big contribution from exports and a build-up of inventories were the main drivers of the performance.

Yet this could prove to be America’s last strong GDP reading for a while. The Federal Reserve’s [aggressive tightening](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/02/the-fed-delivers-another-jumbo-rate-rise-and-its-far-from-done) is beginning to make its impact felt. The housing market has gone cold, which will depress investment levels in the coming months. Higher interest rates are also crimping consumers’ ability to borrow, which in turn is weighing on retail sales. GDP data is, by its nature, backward-looking. Forward-looking indicators are much less rosy.

## What ubiquitous guns mean for America

On Thursday, President Joe Biden will host a reception at the White House for the lunar new year. The festivities may be more sombre than usual. On Saturday a gunman killed 11 people in a dance hall during new year celebrations in Monterey Park, a largely Chinese-American suburb of Los Angeles. Two days later another man murdered seven people—many of them immigrants—in Half Moon Bay, a city south of San Francisco.

California has stricter gun laws than other states: assault weapons are banned, background checks are required to purchase guns, and officials can confiscate them from people deemed dangerous. Such measures help—gun deaths in California are 37% below the national average—but cannot prevent all attacks in a country where [firearms are ubiquitous](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/05/25/why-america-should-make-it-harder-to-buy-guns). State officials are pushing for more restrictions, and Mr Biden has renewed calls for a national assault-weapons ban. But lawmakers will have one eye trained on the Supreme Court, which has recently interpreted the right to bear arms expansively.

## A controversial holiday in Australia

Aussies traditionally celebrate Australia Day, January 26th, with beers and barbecues. In recent years, however, thousands have protested against it. The holiday divides Australians because it marks the landing of the first British settlers in 1788. For Aboriginals—who make up 4% of Australia’s population—Australia Day marks the start of the murder and dispossession of their ancestors. Some call it “Invasion Day” and want to change the holiday’s date.

That now seems possible, even if it is some way off. The Labor government, led by Anthony Albanese, wants to [change the constitution](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/11/australias-leader-wants-to-include-aboriginals-in-the-constitution) to give Aboriginals a bigger say in policy-making. Mr Albanese has already scrapped rules that mandate the holding of citizenship ceremonies on January 26th and is allowing civil servants to take another day off. Some big companies are doing the same. Conservatives bristle, but polls show that almost half of young Australians support changing the date. Sooner or later, Aussies will surely have their patriotic barbecues on a different day.

## No war bounty for America’s armsmakers

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has boosted military budgets across the West: America authorised a record annual defence budget of $858bn in December. Strategic fears about China are contributing, too. Yet the [American defence industry](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/20/despite-ukraine-these-arent-boom-times-for-american-armsmakers) is not reporting bumper results. Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence company, beat market expectations this week for fourth-quarter revenues, but yearly sales were lower than in 2021. On Thursday Northrop Grumman, another big contractor, reported bettter-than-expected results in the final three months of 2022, bouncing back from three consecutive quarters of shrinking profits.

But armsmakers are struggling to fully capitalise on the bellicose mood. The [tight labour market](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2023/01/24/where-have-all-americas-workers-gone) has made it difficult to recruit staff. Brittle supply chains and rising prices have limited crucial weapons components, particularly the semiconductors needed for precision [anti-tank missiles](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/08/23/why-ukraines-supply-of-anti-tank-weapons-may-tail-off). At least manufacturers need not fear America’s new Congress: even the Republicans pushing to curtail the government’s budget very rarely speak of cuts to defence spending.

## Bollywood’s biggest star returns

The release of any film starring Shah Rukh Khan is a big event in India. To his fans, he is known as the King of Bollywood. But the build-up to “Pathaan”, which released this week, has been particularly feverish. The action thriller marks Mr Khan’s return to the big screen after a four-year hiatus (following several flops). It also comes as the Hindi-film industry [desperately seeks a box-office hit](https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2021/02/25/the-siege-of-bollywood) to draw back audiences who have drifted to streaming platforms and South Indian films.

But Mr Khan also has his detractors. Many Hindu nationalists [resent the Muslim actor’s](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2021/10/30/what-does-indias-government-have-against-bollywood) enduring popularity. Some want his new film banned over a musical number “Besharam Rang” (shameless colour), in which Mr Khan’s co-star dances briefly in a skimpy saffron bikini (the colour is closely associated with Hinduism). But the hand-wringing may have helped the film. The song has been viewed 240m times online, and early ticket sales suggest unprecedented public demand.
