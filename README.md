Several EU foreign ministers called for fresh sanctions against<strong> Iran</strong> over its transfer of “kamikaze” drones to <strong>Russia</strong>. Russian forces are believed to have used 28 Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones to attack Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, on Monday, killing at least four people. Separately, a Russian fighter plane crashed into a residential building in the southern Russian city of Yeysk after suffering engine failure, also four dead.

Jeremy Hunt, <strong>Britain’s</strong> new chancellor of the exchequer, reversed almost all the remaining tax measures made in his predecessor’s “[mini-budget](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically)” three weeks ago. The basic rate of tax will remain at 20% indefinitely and the scope of a cap on the price of energy will now be reviewed next April. These measures signal the end of the prime minister’s signature economic policies, leaving Liz Truss in a perilous political position.

America’s justice department recommended that<strong> Steve Bannon</strong> be ordered to serve six months in prison and pay a $200,000 fine when he is sentenced by a judge on Friday. In July the former adviser to Donald Trump was convicted of contempt of Congress for ignoring subpoenas from the [January 6th committee](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/06/10/congresss-capitol-riot-hearing-confirms-donald-trumps-complicity). “His noncompliance has been complete and unremitting”, prosecutors wrote.

<strong>Bank of America’s</strong> results showed a 8% fall in quarterly profits compared with the year before; a smaller than expected drop as rising interest rates offset sluggish investment banking activity. Higher rates are a boon for banks, who make money on the spread they can charge between the cost of borrowing funds and lending them out. At BoA this net interest income was up 24%.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

David Solomon, the head of <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, is set to announce a major restructuring that will consolidate the bank into three main divisions. The asset and wealth management businesses will combine, as will the trading and investment teams. The bank’s unprofitable consumer unit will be broken-up, creating a standalone subsection dealing with corporate partners. These changes mark the company’s third reorganisation in four years, and a retreat from Mr Solomon’s signature project of expanding into direct-to-consumer banking.

The<strong> Swedish parliament</strong> voted for Moderate Party leader <strong>Ulf Kristersson</strong> to become their next prime minister. He will lead a right-wing bloc supported by the Sweden Democrats, a [populist party](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/15/demonising-nationalist-parties-has-not-stemmed-their-rise-in-europe). While the far-right party will not have any seats in cabinet, they have negotiated major changes in government policy, including a cut to Sweden’s refugee quota. Their leader Jimmie Akesson declared this deal a “paradigm shift” on immigration.

<strong>Japan’s </strong>prime minister, Kishida Fumio, ordered an official inquiry into the <strong>Unification Church</strong>, a cult-like religious group. The group attracted [scrutiny](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/07/19/what-drove-yamagami-tetsuya-to-kill-abe-shinzo) after the assasination of former prime minister Abe Shinzo. The family of the man accused of killing him was linked to the church, and it was [later revealed](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/09/26/the-fallout-from-abe-shinzos-murder-could-unseat-his-successor) that almost half of Mr Abe’s and Mr Kishida’s Liberal Democratic Party had some contact with it as well.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 31, the number of days served by Britain’s shortest-serving chancellor, Iain Macleod—eight fewer than Kwasi Kwarteng, who was sacked last week.

## NATO’s not-so-routine nuclear drills

On Monday NATO begins its annual nuclear drills, Steadfast Noon. The exercises, hosted by Belgium and postponed from earlier this year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, include 14 of the alliance’s 30 members. There will be no live warheads, but the manoeuvres include jets that can carry nuclear bombs. NATO’s secretary general, [Jens Stoltenberg](https://te.arielherself.xyz/by-invitation/2022/02/09/jens-stoltenberg-explains-how-to-step-back-from-the-brink-of-european-conflict), has called the operation “routine training” designed to keep the deterrent “safe, secure and effective”.

But the war in Ukraine means that the drills will be far from business as usual. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has made[ transparent threats](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/21/vladimir-putin-vows-to-send-more-invaders-the-west-should-arm-ukraine-faster) to use nuclear weapons amid his faltering invasion. The head of GCHQ, Britain’s spy agency, said last week that there were no signs of an imminent attack, but fears of[ escalation are real](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/09/29/could-the-war-in-ukraine-go-nuclear). NATO expects that Russia will soon hold its own nuclear exercise, dubbed Grom.

The alliance is betting that conducting its nuclear drills helps keep its deterrent potent. Mr Stoltenberg says that avoiding escalation requires “firm, predictable behaviour”. Observers will hope he is right.

## Jeremy Hunt takes the wheel

A fortnight ago, [Jeremy Hunt](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2018/04/05/jeremy-hunt-the-great-survivor)’s career in high office appeared to be at an end. An affable and fastidious former foreign secretary, he had twice run to be leader of the Conservative Party, without success. Now he is the most powerful man in Britain. 

On Monday morning Mr Hunt undid almost all of the tax measures announced by his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng in his “mini-budget” on September 23rd. The basic rate of tax will remain at 20% indefinitely and the scope of a cap on the price of energy will now be reviewed next April. Measures which have already begun the process of legislation, including a cut to the National Insurance payroll tax, will remain.  
  
 Mr Hunt has been tasked with clawing back the trust of bond markets after the market meltdown that followed Mr Kwarteng’s “mini-budget”. With Mr Hunt in the driving seat, Ms Truss is now [prime minister in name only](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/10/14/liz-truss-has-lost-her-chancellor-signature-tax-cut-and-authority). Conservative MPs are clamouring to force her from office. Westminster this week will be a vipers’ nest.

## Chinese cars plug into European markets

Sceptical of splurging marketing budgets on fancy stands in vast exhibition centres, few of the world’s carmakers will congregate in Paris for the first motor show in the city since 2018, which opens on Monday. Flying the tricolore will be France’s Renault and Peugeot, the latter of which joins other brands owned by Stellantis. More notable will be the appearance of BYD and Great Wall Motors, two [Chinese brands](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/13/chinese-marques-try-to-make-inroads-into-western-markets) that will use the event to flaunt electric cars they hope will break into the European market.

China, home to the world’s biggest car industry, also churns out more[ electric vehicles](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/04/09/save-globalisation-buy-a-chinese-ev) than any other country. Several of its makers have Europe in their sights. Nio, a Tesla wannabe, recently showed off three electric models in Berlin that will soon be more widely available on the continent. Already nearly one in 20 EVs sold in Europe is Chinese. Europe’s carmakers, already struggling with the fallout from the pandemic and the transition to electrification, face one more problem.

## India’s oldest party seeks a revamp

On Monday members of the Congress, India’s main opposition party, will vote for a new president. For the first time in nearly 25 years the new boss will be someone outside of the Gandhi clan, which has long run the party as a [family business](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2021/11/27/for-indias-opposition-to-recover-the-gandhis-should-quit). The choice is between Shashi Tharoor, a smooth-talking diplomat-turned-politician, and Mallikarjun Kharge, an 80-year-old party veteran and Gandhi-family stooge.

Mr Tharoor believes that fresh, non-dynastic leadership can revitalise India’s grand old party. With a general election less than two years away, the Congress desperately needs it. In the past two elections the party has been swept aside by the ruling Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. In 2019 the BJP took nearly double the Congress’s share of the vote.

But Mr Tharoor’s hopes may be in vain. The build-up to the Congress’s leadership election has featured the same [ineptitude and in-fighting](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/10/06/indias-congress-party-seems-determined-to-prove-its-critics-right) that have dogged the party for years. More importantly, the Gandhi family is unlikely to cede control. Mr Kharge is expected to win comfortably.

## The six Booker hopefuls

The Booker prize briefly turns literature into hot news. The most coveted honour in English-language fiction, to be awarded on Monday night, makes six titles glow with the heat of incendiary headlines. In “Glory”, NoViolet Bulawayo’s talking animals stage a political parable of her [unhappy homeland](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2019/09/07/robert-mugabe-leaves-a-bitter-legacy), Zimbabwe. Percival Everett’s “The Trees” blends mystery, horror and elegy as it unearths [racist atrocities](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2019/11/14/memories-of-emmett-till) in the American South. Shehan Karunatilaka’s “[The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/08/18/shehan-karunatilaka-returns-with-another-thrilling-satire)”, an incandescent tragicomic story narrated by a ghost, torches corruption and injustice in Sri Lanka.

Quietly and succinctly—at 116 pages, hers is the shortest book ever shortlisted— Claire Keegan burns through rural [Ireland’s abusive secrets](https://te.arielherself.xyz/christmas-specials/2019/12/18/the-liberalisation-of-ireland) in “Small Things Like These”. Alan Garner, a veteran fabulist, unites northern English folklore with quantum physics in “Treacle Walker”; and “Oh William!’ is the third instalment in a lauded family saga by Elizabeth Strout, an American author. Her book is popular with bookworms and bookies alike. For sheer prose chutzpah, Mr Karunatilaka should take the gong. But “Glory” might live up to its name.
