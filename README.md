<strong>America</strong> said <strong>Russia</strong> is not complying with New Start, the two countries’ last remaining <strong>nuclear-arms</strong> control treaty. Russia has suspended weapons inspections and pulled out of consultations, officials from America’s state department said in a report to Congress. The compliance failures heighten concerns that the two powers will be [unable to negotiate](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/07/31/will-the-ukraine-war-ring-the-knell-for-nuclear-arms-control) an extension to New Start, which expires in 2026. Meanwhile, America is preparing to send more aid to Ukraine to help it repel Russia’s attacks. The package, reported to be worth more than $2bn, could include long-range rockets.

<strong>America </strong>and<strong> India</strong> launched several defence and technology initiatives to counter China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific. They will co-operate in several areas including artificial intelligence, semiconductors and weapons production. Many countries have adopted [similar Indo-Pacific strategies](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2023/01/04/reinventing-the-indo-pacific) in recent years. America is also hoping to wean India off its reliance on Russian weapons.

<strong>Factory activity</strong> in several <strong>Asian countries</strong> shrank in January amid [slowing growth](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2023/01/24/how-the-world-economy-could-avoid-recession) in America and Europe. Manufacturing indices in China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan all contracted. Chinese factories were hit by staff absences because of surging covid-19 infections. However, activity in South-East Asian countries, such as Indonesia and Thailand, picked up.

In <strong>France </strong>protesters paralysed public transport and closed schools in the second national demonstration against President Emmanuel Macron’s most recent attempt to reform <strong>pensions</strong>. Mr Macron wants to raise France’s [unusually low](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2023/01/31/why-is-the-french-pension-age-so-low) minimum retirement age from 62 to 64. But this has proved wildly unpopular: over a million people attended the previous protest on January 19th and 68% of French people disagree with the reform.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Exxon Mobil</strong> reported a record annual profit last year, of $55.7bn. The only firms that have outperformed the oil major—or are likely to—are Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft. It was the fourth-best performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 last year—up by about 80%. Exxon’s stellar year was fuelled by [surging energy prices](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/05/31/why-the-oil-price-is-spiking-again) caused by the war in Ukraine.

<strong>Snap’s</strong> fourth-quarter revenues, of $1.3bn, were more or less flat compared with the same period a year ago. Its share price fell by 13% in post-session trading. The social-media firm [reported a loss](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/31/what-went-wrong-with-snap-netflix-and-uber) of $288m. By contrast<strong> Spotify’s </strong>share price leapt by almost 13%. The audio-streaming service reported a quarterly loss of €231m ($251m) on revenues of €3.2bn, but a 20% increase in users, to 489m.

<strong>Premier League</strong> football clubs splurged a record £815m ($1bn) in the January<strong> transfer window</strong>, smashing the previous high of £430m set in 2018. Chelsea, the biggest spenders, doled out £323m. That was more than the combined outlay of clubs in Europe’s other major leagues. [Revenues of many European clubs](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2023/01/19/football-clubs-revenues-rebound-from-covid-especially-in-england) have yet to recover after the pandemic.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 11bn, the total number of wet wipes Britons dispose of each year. So many that they have begun to form islets in rivers. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2023/01/30/britains-newest-islets-are-made-of-wet-wipes).

## The IMF upgrades its growth forecasts

Since the IMF last forecast global growth the world economy has enjoyed good news. Headline [inflation has fallen](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/01/26/the-world-economys-inflation-problem-is-easing), reducing some of the pressure on central banks to deliver ever-tighter monetary policy. Europe is having a [warm winter,](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2023/01/11/the-energy-crisis-and-europes-astonishing-luck) easing its energy crisis. And China has [ditched](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/01/05/how-chinas-reopening-will-disrupt-the-world-economy) its destructive zero-covid policy. The result is that the fund now expects the world economy to grow by 2.9% in 2023—below the long-term average of 3.8%, but up by 0.2 percentage points on its previous projection in October.

The fund warns, however, of dangers ahead. Underlying inflation is still rising, fuelled by overheating [labour markets](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2023/01/24/where-have-all-americas-workers-gone). It will be harder to refill Europe’s gas storage for next winter without Russian inflows and with China hungry for energy. Financial stability risks “remain elevated”. And growth is not quickening everywhere. The fund has downgraded its growth forecast for Britain by almost a percentage point to -0.6%, making it the only major economy projected to shrink in 2023.

## Some relief for Adani

Last week Hindenburg Research, a small American investment firm, published [a report](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2023/01/27/a-short-seller-rattles-gautam-adanis-empire) calling the Adani Group, a big [Indian conglomerate](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/09/01/adani-v-ambani-the-battle-of-the-tycoons), “the largest con in corporate history”. Adani dismissed the report as a ploy by Hindenburg, which as a short-seller makes money when its targets’ share prices tank, to depress its share price ahead of a secondary-share offering, which ends on Tuesday. If it was, it worked. The market value of the group’s firms fell by nearly $70bn—even though it published a 413-page rebuttal.

The fallout could be more devastating yet. Life Insurance Corporation of India, a state insurer with 365bn rupees ($4.5bn) invested in Adani companies, is studying the issue. Opposition parties have called for a “serious investigation”, pointing to ties between the prime minister, Narendra Modi, and Gautam Adani, the group’s founder and boss. So far Mr Modi and his allies have been quiet. Some prospective investors, however, have not. The share offering, with which Adani hopes to raise $2.5bn, was fully subscribed on Tuesday.

## Saving the ​​Colorado river

Coursing through America’s arid southwest, the [Colorado river](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2021/08/21/the-american-west-is-drying-up) supplies 40m people in seven states with water and hydropower. But the region and river have suffered a two-decade [drought](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2021/06/15/is-the-american-west-in-a-megadrought), which has caused the water level to drop considerably. In 2021 the federal government declared the river’s first-ever water shortage. In August last year [triggered mandatory cuts](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/08/16/the-most-important-river-in-the-american-west-is-drying-up) to how much water can be used by several areas in the Colorado river basin.  
  
 To comply with federal goals, states will need to agree who should cut what to reduce their usage by 2m-4m acre-feet (4.9bn cubic metres) this year, around one third of the river’s annual flow. Tuesday marks a deadline, which has already been extended, for them to submit a plan. If they do not, the federal government will dictate how water use must be reduced. Historically, states have determined their own water rights. Changing that may be unpopular but it may be the only way to keep the river flowing.

## Meloni’s steady start

Giorgia Meloni’s right-wing Italian government completes its [first 100 days](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/01/26/after-a-steady-first-100-days-choppier-waters-await-giorgia-meloni) on Tuesday. Its record, so far, has been reassuring. It has been a steadfast ally to Ukraine while following a conservative, but not extreme, programme at home. The government successfully steered through parliament a budget for 2023. Her Brothers of Italy (FdI) party is polling at almost 30%, compared with a vote share of 26% in September’s general election.  
  
 But the smooth sailing may not last. The FdI’s gains have come at the expense of the Northern League and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia, coalition partners that may yet cause Ms Meloni problems, especially over plans for constitutional reform. During the next 100 days Italy should receive its third tranche of almost €200bn ($218bn) on offer from the EU’s post-pandemic recovery fund. But spending is way behind schedule, perhaps due to bureaucratic shortcomings. And while markets have been supportive, heavily-indebted Italy remains vulnerable to a bond market sell-off.

## Shetland modernises its marauders

Men dressed up as Vikings will march around Lerwick in Shetland—Scotland’s northernmost inhabited islands—on Tuesday, as they do every year. For “Up Helly Aa”, Europe’s biggest fire festival, a thousand “guizers” parade with torches and burn an imitation longship. This year women, previously relegated to serving food and drink as “hostesses”, will be allowed to carouse alongside them. 

The decision follows a long campaign by some locals to update the event, which contributes significantly to Shetland’s tourism revenue. Equality is slowly coming to the islands in other ways, too. In 2022 women were elected to senior positions on the islands’ council for the first time. Purists who might lament that the upgrade in women’s roles is a break with Shetland’s Norse traditions need not fret: Up Helly Aa was actually dreamt up by Victorian do-gooders as a way to distract young men from drinking away the long winter nights.
