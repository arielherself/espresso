<strong>America’s government</strong> hit its $31.4 trillion [“debt-ceiling”](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2021/09/21/what-is-americas-debt-ceiling), meaning it can no longer borrow money by issuing bonds. America’s treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, has asked lawmakers to “act promptly” to raise the cap. [Republicans](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/11/17/in-a-republican-house-investigations-and-fiscal-clashes-loom), who now control the House of Representatives, are unlikely to do so unless President Joe Biden agrees to cuts in federal spending—which he appears unwilling to do.

<strong>America</strong> reported lower-than-expected <strong>unemployment figures</strong>, with just 190,000 new applications for unemployment benefits in the week to January 14th, falling from 205,000 in the previous week. Despite rising interest rates, [layoffs in the tech industry](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/11/10/as-tech-lay-offs-spread-meta-sacks-11000-workers) and fears of a looming recession, America’s labour market remains strong. In December the unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, matching its lowest level in the past 50 years.

President Volodymyr Zelensky’s chief-of-staff, [Andriy Yermak](https://te.arielherself.xyz/by-invitation/2022/12/15/volodymyr-zelenskys-chief-of-staff-on-how-to-end-war-in-ukraine), called for Western countries to [send tanks](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/01/11/the-west-should-supply-tanks-to-ukraine) to <strong>Ukraine</strong> “as soon as possible”. The plea comes ahead of a summit on Friday of Western and NATO allies at the Ramstein air base in Germany. There <strong>America</strong> is expected to announce a package of military aid, worth around $2.5bn, including 100 Stryker combat vehicles.

In <strong>France</strong> hundreds of marches are being held to protest against a government plan to raise the minimum [retirement age](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/01/10/emmanuel-macron-unveils-his-pension-reforms) from 62 years to 64. Strikes have also caused disruption to schools, domestic transport networks, flights and a ferry service to Britain. A previous attempt by Emmanuel Macron, the president, to reform pensions in 2019 was [scrapped after protests](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2019/12/12/french-workers-strike-to-keep-their-lavish-pensions).

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

In a surprise announcement, <strong>Jacinda Ardern</strong>, New Zealand’s prime minister, said she would step down within the next three weeks. Ms Ardern was widely praised for her [handling](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2020/10/03/a-fairy-tale-election-result-beckons-for-new-zealands-prime-minister) of the pandemic and for her [response](https://te.arielherself.xyz/erasmus/2019/03/22/finding-a-new-equilibrium-after-christchurch-wont-be-easy) to a horrific terrorist attack on a Christchurch mosque in 2019. However her popularity has recently plummeted. In a tearful statement she said she did not have “enough in the tank” to continue leading the country. She was elected prime minister in 2017, aged just 37.

<strong>China’s</strong> health authority said that demand for critical care for <strong>covid-19 patients </strong>had peaked, with 40% fewer people in hospital on January 17th than on January 5th. For the first time [since 2019](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/02/03/chinese-new-year-is-disrupted-for-a-third-year) people may [travel freely](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2023/01/12/many-chinese-villagers-seem-ready-to-move-on-from-covid-19) during the holidays surrounding the lunar new year on Sunday, potentially increasing infections. Meanwhile, Hong Kong announced that it will scrap mandatory quarantine from January 30th.

The <strong>British Academy Film Awards</strong> announced this year’s nominations, with “All Quiet on the Western Front”, a war epic made by Netflix, scooping 14. Other frontrunners include [“The Banshees of Inisherin”](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/11/23/the-best-films-of-2022), a black comedy about two old drinking buddies on a rural Irish island, and [“Everything Everywhere All at Once”](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/09/01/the-rise-and-rise-of-a24-a-champion-of-storytelling-on-screen), a mind-bending fantasy. Notably, Steven Speilberg’s “The Fabelmans” received just one nomination.

## America’s debt-ceiling madness

On Thursday the American government hit its “[debt ceiling](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2021/09/21/what-is-americas-debt-ceiling)”—the upper limit on how much money it can borrow by issuing bonds. The ceiling, a political creation, can be lifted by a simple vote in Congress. That, however, will not happen anytime soon. 

Republicans, newly in control of the House of Representatives, demand big cuts to federal spending, including to public-health insurance and other social programmes. The Democrats, who control the Senate, refuse.

For now the Treasury is using special-accounting tactics to ensure that it has money to cover all obligations, from social-insurance outlays to bond payments. Analysts believe these manoeuvres will last until the third quarter, which ends in June. As that deadline nears, global markets will be on edge about the possibility of an American default. Precedent suggests that Congress will reach a last-minute compromise. But given the clout of Republican hardliners, such as those who [blocked the appointment ](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/01/04/what-the-kevin-mccarthy-saga-means-for-americas-congress)of their speaker, the dangers of an accident loom far larger than in the past.

## Protests against French pension reform

French commuters are dealing with major disruption on Thursday after every union in the country called for a day of protests, marches and strikes against the government’s plan to raise the [legal minimum pension age](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/01/10/emmanuel-macron-unveils-his-pension-reforms) from 62 to 64. Organisers hope to get 1m people out on the streets. Trains, metros, buses, airports and schools are all affected.

Thanks to a long lifespan and a low average retirement age, the French spend longer in [retirement](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/12/05/can-you-afford-to-retire) than pensioners in almost any other OECD country. They are in no mood to give up this privilege. A poll suggests that two-thirds are against raising the pension age to 64.

President Emmanuel Macron is not around to witness the disturbance, however. He is at a summit in Barcelona, where France and Spain will sign a bilateral treaty to strengthen their friendship. Some of the ministers accompanying him stand ready to return to Paris early, should things get out of hand.

## A new central station in Bangkok

South-East Asia’s largest train station opened on Thursday. Officially named Krung Thep Aphiwat (“glory of Bangkok”) Central Terminal, but known as Bang Sue Grand Central, the sleek, undulating terminus in the north of Thailand’s capital has 24 platforms and can handle 600,000 passengers a day. 

Until recently Thailand’s railways were notorious for ancient diesel engines and derailments. Bangkok’s previous central station building was completed in 1916. The government hopes investment in its railways will pay off in boosts to [tourism](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/02/03/south-east-asias-tourism-industry-is-hobbled-by-uncertainty) and reduced road congestion. The new station, which took over a decade to build and cost around $1bn, is part of an explosion of urban transport in Bangkok, as well as being a hub for national and international lines. Bang Sue will serve commuter, long-distance and, eventually, high-speed trains. It will also connect three airports and, later this decade, trains from Kunming in China will stop on route to Singapore.

## Erdogan’s pre-election spending

Turkish central bankers kept interest rates unchanged at 9% when they met on Thursday. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president, is determined to keep the economy growing, and credit flowing, in order to help his chances in elections due to be held on May 14th. 

Last year Mr Erdogan pressured the bank to slash interest rates from 14% to 9%. By October inflation had reached 85.5%, stinging the poor and lower-middle classes—Mr Erdogan’s core voters—the hardest. Inflation has since fallen, though only to 64.3%, and the president’s poll numbers are improving. Foreign reserves are being topped up with cash from Russia and Gulf states but the central bank is rapidly spending it to keep the depreciating lira afloat.

In December the government raised the minimum wage by 55%, its third large increase in 2022<strong>.</strong> It also in effect lowered the retirement age, allowing 2m extra Turks to claim their pensions. The opposition sees blatant bids for votes.

## Ronaldo and Messi meet in Saudi Arabia

On Thursday Cristiano Ronaldo, a [brilliant](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/11/17/lionel-messi-and-cristiano-ronaldo-have-forged-modern-football) but fading Portuguese footballer, will play his first match in Saudi Arabia since moving there last year. Mr Ronaldo will captain players from his new club, Al-Nassr, in a friendly against Paris St-Germain. The French team includes his [great rival](https://te.arielherself.xyz/game-theory/2015/03/24/the-once-and-future-king), Lionel Messi, who led Argentina to victory in the World Cup in Qatar. 

Mr Ronaldo and Mr Messi are both closely linked with football in the Gulf. PSG is owned by Qatar’s state investment fund, and Mr Messi is a “tourism ambassador” for Saudi Arabia (whose team [beat Argentina](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/23/what-saudi-arabias-football-victory-means-for-the-middle-east) in Qatar). 

The Saudi government wants to host the World Cup, with Greece and Egypt, in 2030. But the choice of Qatar by football’s governing body was [tarnished](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/11/10/the-world-cup-is-tarnished-should-fans-enjoy-it-anyway) by corruption. The host had a record of abusing human rights and is so hot that the tournament was held in November and December. Saudi Arabia could pose some of the same problems. FIFA may decide that a different bid is an easier bet.
