Police in <strong>Brazil </strong>arrested around 1,200 people involved in the [storming of government buildings](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2023/01/09/supporters-of-jair-bolsonaro-mount-an-insurrection-in-brazil) in the capital, Brasília, on Sunday. The supreme court has ordered that tented camps of <em>bolsonaristas</em>—supporters of <strong>Jair Bolsonaro</strong>, a former president, who were behind the riots—be dismantled. President [Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/12/31/brazils-new-president-faces-a-fiscal-crunch-and-a-fickle-congress) blamed Mr Bolsonaro for “encouraging” the mob and condemned the police for acting too slowly. Mr Bolsonaro, who is currently in Florida, denied the accusation and condemned the violence.

<strong>China</strong> conducted its second round of military exercises around <strong>Taiwan</strong> in less than a month. Taiwan’s government said that four Chinese warships and 57 planes had passed near the island. Around half the aircraft breached Taiwan’s ​​air-defence identification zone. The show of force comes as a delegation of German politicians arrived in Taiwan, which [China calls its own](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2021/05/01/the-most-dangerous-place-on-earth).

<strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> reportedly plans to sack about 3,200 employees this week as it seeks to cut costs amid uncertainty in the capital markets. Bloomberg reported that more than a third of the lay-offs will come from the [investment bank’s](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/10/18/goldman-sachss-disastrous-main-street-gamble) trading and banking units. It would be the biggest purge since the global financial crisis in 2008.

<strong>AstraZeneca</strong>, an Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical giant, agreed to buy <strong>CinCor Pharma</strong>, an American biotech company for $1.8bn. The acquisition will boost AstraZeneca’s development of heart and kidney drugs, its second most-lucrative after its cancer treatments. CinCor faced a sell-off in November after a trial of baxdrostat, a drug designed to lower blood pressure, fell short of expectations.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

Volodymyr Zelensky, <strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, said that Ukrainian troops were “repelling constant Russian attempts to advance” on Bakhmut, a city in the east. Earlier Ukraine denied Russia’s claim that its strike on a dormitory in Kramatorsk, another eastern city, had killed at least 600 Ukrainian soldiers. A spokesperson for the Ukrainian army said only civilian infrastructure had been damaged.

<strong>Israel’s </strong>new far-right minister for national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, declared that the <strong>Palestinian flag </strong>was to be barred from public display within Israeli territory. The security forces already enjoyed the right to take it down during police actions; Mr Ben-Gvir went further by saying that even [waving the flag](https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2021/05/19/the-illusion-of-citizenship-has-gone-israels-arabs-look-to-the-future) should count as an “act in support of terrorism” and “incitement against Israel”.

A shortage of <strong>onions in the Philippines</strong> has sent their price to eye-watering heights, at more than 600 pesos ($10.88) per kilogram, or three times that of chicken. The country plans to import 22,000 tonnes of the staple to ease pressure on inflation, which reached a 14-year high of 8.1% in December. Of that, [onions](https://te.arielherself.xyz/special-report/2019/10/10/why-onions-and-pigs-can-give-economists-a-headache) accounted for 0.3 percentage points.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 56%, the percentage of people in Latin America who identify as Catholic, down from 80% in 1995. [Read the full story.](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2023/01/02/the-death-of-pope-benedict-removes-a-problem-for-liberal-catholics)

## The North American Leaders’ Summit

On Monday the presidents of America and Mexico and the prime minister of Canada will meet in Mexico City. Talks between Joe Biden, Andrés Manuel López Obrador and Justin Trudeau will focus on regional integration, especially how to take advantage of “nearshoring”—the trend for companies to bring production closer to home. North America already accounts for around a third of global GDP, but there is the potential for growth.

But for every positive agenda item there is a tricky counterpart. America and Canada are concerned about Mexican energy policies that favour its national companies and are being disputed under [USMCA](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2018/10/04/canada-joins-north-americas-revised-trade-deal), the regional free-trade agreement. America wants Mexico to crack down on drugs coming north, while Mexico has asked America to curb guns flowing the other way. 

Still, announcements before the summit—from Mexico of a capture of a drug baron and new immigration proposals from America that may stop so many migrants crossing through Mexico—suggest the “three amigos” want to keep it as friendly as possible.

## Bolsonaristas run wild in Brasília

Brazil’s capital was [thrust into chaos](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2023/01/09/supporters-of-jair-bolsonaro-mount-an-insurrection-in-brazil) on Sunday as thousands of supporters of a former president, [Jair Bolsonaro](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/11/23/jair-bolsonaros-challenge-to-brazils-election-was-rejected), invaded their country’s Congress, the presidential palace and the Supreme Court. The rampage bore striking similarities to the [storming of America’s Capitol](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/12/23/the-house-delivers-its-800-page-report-on-the-january-6th-riot) on January 6th 2021 by followers of Donald Trump. The insurrectionists broke windows and damaged furniture; in the Senate, they climbed onto the stage and slid down it as if it were a slide. 

The current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, declared a federal security intervention in the district of Brasília, and condemned the police for acting too slowly. Some officers were filmed chatting with protesters and taking selfies rather than intervening. Police eventually retook control of the three buildings, arrested more than 1,000 protesters and seized 40 buses that had been used to transport them. Now the government must clean up the damage—and the police forces too, which will take much longer.

## Europe holds on to its workers

There is one big bright spot in [Europe’s economic malaise](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/24/europe-faces-an-enduring-crisis-of-energy-and-geopolitics): the labour market. Unemployment is at record lows, despite the energy and inflation crunch that is hitting households and businesses. Labour market data from [the EU](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2023/01/05/fifty-years-ago-the-eu-cracked-the-secret-of-its-current-success), released on Monday, showed that employment has remained strong.

Businesses’ and consumers’ view of the economy is still more negative than the long-term average. However, many businesses still say they expect to hire more workers. Since this current crisis is expected to be short-lived, that seems sensible. But it is also because demographic change is about to hit the economy, hard. 

The share of the EU population who will soon retire (aged 60-64 years) is 6.5%, more than a percentage point higher than the share of youngsters entering the labour market (aged 15-19) at 5.2%, sapping the economy of working-age adults. In such a tight labour market recruiting and retaining workers will be a growing challenge.

## Britain’s cost-of-living crisis

The political turmoil may have eased, but Britain is still a [country in crisis](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/12/15/britains-economic-record-since-2007-ranks-near-the-bottom-among-peer-countries). A new report by the Resolution Foundation, a think-tank, makes gloomy reading.

Food prices continue to rise at record rates, as real wages are falling. Although inflation and energy prices should ease this year, the latter will be offset by a drop in government support. Rising interest rates will continue to hurt those with mortgages, and those who rent from mortgage-holders. The report finds that, after housing costs are accounted for, the disposable income of a typical British working family is set to fall by £2,100 ($2,554) in 2023.

The economy looks brighter for older, richer households, whose savings will be boosted by rising rates. But they may have other worries. A [crisis in the National Health Service](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/britains-nhs-faces-huge-challenges-in-2023), exacerbated by a winter spike in covid-19 and flu, is contributing to levels of excess deaths higher than all but the worst weeks of the pandemic.

## The secret to a happy life

What makes for a happy, fulfilling life? In an upcoming book Robert Waldinger and Marc Schulz, directors of the Harvard Study of Adult Development, which for more than 80 years has conducted a scientific study of adult life and happiness, answer this question with a mixture of gentle anecdote and statistical rigour.  
  
 With more than 80 years of surveys, brain scans and blood tests at their disposal—to identify the factors that influence happiness—the authors are a cross between data-savvy psychologists and Stoic philosophers. The pair are keen on graphs but also on sage maxims: attention is the most valuable possession since wandering minds are unhappy, for example. As for their fundamental question of what makes a happy life, the short answer is “good relationships”, whether defined by love or less ethereal feelings. The good news is that it is never too late to form them.
