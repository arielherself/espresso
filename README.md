There were remarkable scenes of survivors, including a mother and her baby, being pulled from the rubble of collapsed buildings in <strong>Turkey</strong>, five days after devastating earthquakes struck. Even so, the [death toll](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2023/02/06/massive-earthquakes-in-turkey-and-northern-syria-kill-thousands) from the disaster there and in neighbouring <strong>Syria</strong> passed 24,000. America said it would suspend some sanctions on Syria for 180 days, to help ease the supply of aid to the war-torn country.

The <strong>Pentagon </strong>shot down an object flying at high altitude (12,000 metres) over Alaska’s airspace. The downed object was “roughly the size of a small car”. No indication was given about its owner or whether it was a spy balloon. Meanwhile America blacklisted five Chinese companies and a research institute connected to a suspected balloon-surveillance programme.

<strong>France’s </strong>government braced itself for a fourth day of <strong>protests </strong>against plans to raise the [pension age](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2023/01/31/why-is-the-french-pension-age-so-low) from 62 to 64. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to demonstrate; in January, more than 1m took part in strikes. Despite spending, on average, longer in retirement than people in almost any country in the OECD, most French people oppose President Emmanuel Macron’s plans.

Natalia Gavrilita, <strong>Moldova’s</strong> pro-Western prime minister, resigned. Ms Gavrilita, who was elected in 2021, has seen her popularity plummet as Moldova struggles to cope with an influx of refugees from neighbouring Ukraine. The country has also had some of its energy supplies cut by Russia, which is [angry](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/moldova-is-trying-to-stay-out-of-russias-war-with-ukraine/21809093) at its plan to join the EU. Dorin Recean, a security adviser, will be the new PM.

The <strong>FBI </strong>found one classified document in a consensual search of the Indiana home of <strong>Mike Pence</strong>, America’s former vice-president. The search came several weeks after his aides found additional classified papers there. The FBI has [also searched](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2023/01/13/the-presidential-mislaying-of-classified-documents-is-infectious) the private homes of President Joe Biden and—with a search warrant—his predecessor, Donald Trump, for classified documents. 

<strong>Russia’s </strong>deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, said that the country would cut its oil output by around 500,000 barrels a day in response to [Western sanctions](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/02/01/why-the-wests-oil-sanctions-on-russia-are-proving-to-be-underwhelming). On Sunday the EU banned the [seaborne import](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2023/01/29/how-russia-dodges-oil-sanctions-on-an-industrial-scale) of Russian diesel, having already done so for crude oil. The G7 has also introduced a price cap. Oil prices rose on Mr Novak’s announcement. 

Japan’s prime minister, Kishida Fumio, is reportedly set to appoint<strong> Ueda Kazuo</strong>, an academic, to replace Kuroda Haruhiko as governor of the [Bank of Japan](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/02/02/the-bank-of-japan-should-stop-defending-its-cap-on-bond-yields). The change comes as the central bank prepares to tighten monetary policy for the first time since 2007. The unexpected choice of Mr Ueda, an academic and doveish former member of the bank’s policy board, has increased uncertainty around what the bank might do next.

<strong>Word of the week: </strong><em>dekasegi ryugaku</em>, a Japanese term that means “earning money while studying overseas”. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2023/02/09/japanese-workers-are-seeking-higher-wages-overseas).

## A tense anniversary for Iran’s Islamic Republic

On Saturday Iranians mark 44 years since the country overthrew its secular monarchy. It has been an unnerving few months for the theocratic regime that replaced it: protests over the death of[ Mahsa Amini](https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2022/09/28/im-the-same-as-mahsa-and-i-want-my-freedom-anger-at-irans-regime-spills-onto-the-streets), a young woman arrested for wearing her headscarf “improperly”, posed the biggest threat to its authority in years. 

By locking up nearly 20,000 people and sentencing dozens to death the clerics have[ dampened dissent](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2023/01/12/protests-have-subsided-in-iran-but-clerics-cannot-yet-proclaim-victory). University campuses, which were hubs of protest, became heavily policed. As part of an annual pardoning, the regime has reportedly offered amnesty or reduced prison sentences for “tens of thousands” (though the terms would seem to exclude most political prisoners).

Iran’s economy, however, is a mess. Inflation has soared. The government subsidises petrol, meaning a litre last month cost the equivalent of five American cents, but this is unsustainable. When prices inevitably go up Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, may face renewed resistance.

## Starlink’s indispensable role in Ukraine

Ukrainian troops have used the Starlink satellite-internet service [for everything](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2023/01/05/how-elon-musks-satellites-have-saved-ukraine-and-changed-warfare) from artillery spotting and command-and-control to flying military drones. But earlier this week Gwynne Shotwell, the president of SpaceX, which provides the portable antennas, announced that the firm is restricting military uses of its technology. Ms Shotwell said that the technology “was never intended to be weaponised”, and that SpaceX had taken steps to prevent Ukraine from using it to control drones. Her comments puzzled critics: in December SpaceX revealed the existence of “Starshield”, a version of Starlink aimed squarely at governmental and military customers. 

This development has worsened already strained relations between Ukraine and the tech firm. SpaceX has reportedly prevented its service from working in Crimea, where Ukraine has conducted numerous raids. Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian government adviser, said the company should choose which side it is on. But besides such displays of public displeasure, Ukraine has few other options. For now, no other satellite-internet firm can match Starlink’s scale.

## Donatello, a father of the Renaissance

Michelangelo’s chiselled, five-metre-high David, carved in the early 1500s, may be the world’s most recognisable sculpture. Yet that work owes a debt to another Italian master, Donato di Niccolo di Betto Bardi, better known as Donatello. His bronze David—lithe, enigmatic and less than two metres tall—was the first free-standing nude statue since antiquity, predating Michelangelo’s by about 60 years. 

On Saturday a breathtaking exhibition of Donatello’s statues, busts and carvings opens at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among its delights are his shallow bas-reliefs, noteworthy for their one-point perspective and illusions of depth. His figures, meanwhile, are delicately rendered and anatomically precise. Little wonder he is called a father of the Renaissance, cited as an influence on Michelangelo, [Raphael](https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2020/05/31/raphaels-genius-and-the-future-of-museums-on-display-in-rome) and other successors. Few museums outside Italy own Donatello’s work, making the show a rare treat.

## Male stripping and entrepreneurship

Early in many films, in what is known as the “inciting incident”, a character must make a momentous choice. Their decision puts the plot in motion. In “Magic Mike’s Last Dance”, released in America and Britain on Friday, the protagonist’s dilemma is simple: do I gyrate for this rich woman in my underwear or not?

Mike (Channing Tatum) obliges, and is whisked off to London by his client to set up an all-male strip show. The characters insist that it is a noble and ancient art form—although all that thrusting and grinding will make one’s testicles “chafed as shit”, Mike warns his new recruits.

The film is a meta-commentary on itself. The first two “Magic Mike” films so titillated viewers—the first one made $167m from a $7m budget—that Mr Tatum decided to turn the premise into a live show. Launched in 2017, it is still being performed in Las Vegas and London. Sex, it seems, still sells.

## Weekend profile: Gustavo Dudamel, star maestro

Gustavo Dudamel is easily excited—unusually so in the [serious world](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/11/17/the-classical-music-world-is-grappling-with-accessibility) of classical music. “Everything was too loud and everything was too fast, and I loved it,” remembered Sir Simon Rattle, an illustrious conductor, of his introduction to Mr Dudamel, then a [young prodigy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2013/12/23/gustavo-dudamels-next-mountain). Now aged 42, Mr Dudamel has mastered the tempo without sacrificing the passion. On Tuesday it was announced that he will jump from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which he has led since 2009, to the New York Philharmonic in 2026. 

Born in Venezuela, Mr Dudamel got his start in the country’s famous free music education programme, El Sistema, playing the violin. When his own conductor was late to rehearsal one day, he picked up the baton and gave it a whirl. His conductor invited him to be his assistant; Mr Dudamel was about 12. He soon began directing a Venezuelan orchestra and won an international conducting competition in Germany at the age of 23. 

Today the curly-haired Mr Dudamel is one of the world’s most recognisable maestros. He has brought verve to the Los Angeles Philharmonic; the Paris Opera, where he is music director; and the animated film “Trolls 2: World Tour” (for which he voiced the character of a conductor). He has led Venezuela’s Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra in a rousing version of “Mambo”, from Leonard Bernstein’s “West Side Story”, a number of times. One performance has 1.7m views on YouTube. 

Mr Dudamel’s appointment in New York should restore some cachet to the ensemble, which, in its glory days in the mid-20th century, was led by Bernstein. Today it faces a challenging financial future: elderly concertgoers have been reluctant to return even as the pandemic subsides. Mr Dudamel’s spirited conducting and renown promise to attract crowds and wealthy donors.

In Los Angeles, he always made a point of bowing to the cheap seats behind the orchestra. He encourages clapping between sets and rejects stilted dress codes. It is the music, not its trappings, that so excites him.
