## <p align="center">Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter</p>

<p align="center">Origin: <a href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-in-brief">https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-in-brief</a><hr>

<strong>OPEC+</strong>, the group of petroleum-exporting countries including <strong>Saudi Arabia </strong>and <strong>Russia</strong>, agreed to [slash their output quota](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/10/05/opec-defies-joe-biden-with-a-big-output-cut) for oil by 2m barrels per day, equivalent to 2% global supply, to boost prices in anticipation of shrinking demand. It is the biggest cut since 2020. The White House called the decision “shortsighted” and accused the cartel of “aligning with Russia”. Meanwhile, EU ambassadors agreed to a <strong>price cap </strong>on Russian oil to punish Mr Putin for raising [nuclear threats](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/09/29/could-the-war-in-ukraine-go-nuclear) in his war with Ukraine. The bloc has been trying to reduce its reliance on Russian energy.

Volodymyr Zelensky, <strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, said more villages have been [liberated](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/03/as-ukraine-smashes-through-more-russian-lines-russians-wonder-whom-to-blame) in Kherson, the southern region partially occupied by <strong>Russian</strong> forces. On Wednesday Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, ratified the annexation of four Ukrainian regions, including Kherson, and vowed to “stabilise” the situation. When asked about Russian forces retreating in these regions, a spokesman for the Kremlin insisted that Russia would recapture any territory it lost.

<strong>Annie Ernaux</strong>, a French author known for her intensely [personal works](https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2021/09/13/a-poignant-abortion-drama-prevails-at-the-venice-film-festival), won the <strong>Nobel prize for literature</strong>. The Swedish Academy cited her “courage and clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements and collective restraints of personal memory”.

A former police officer killed at least 38 people, including 22 children, in a <strong>gun attack</strong> at a day-care centre in north-east <strong>Thailand</strong>, according to police. Reports suggest the gunman, who was armed with a shotgun, pistol and knife, killed himself and his family after the attack. Thailand’s prime minister, [Prayut Chan-ocha](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/06/16/thailands-military-ruler-is-on-the-back-foot), called the attack “horrifying”.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>North Korea </strong>flew 12 war planes near the border with South Korea, possibly as part of “air-to-surface firing drills”, South Korean officials said. Earlier, North Korea fired two more <strong>ballistic missiles </strong>off its east coast, the sixth such launch in less than a fortnight. North Korean officials called the blitz “counter-action measures” in response to American and South Korean joint military drills.

The third-place finisher in the [first round](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/10/03/brazils-presidential-election-will-go-to-a-run-off) of <strong>Brazil’s presidential election</strong> endorsed Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a leftist former president who took 48% of the vote. Simone Tebet, a centre-right senator, won 4% in Sunday’s poll. She said Jair Bolsonaro, the hard-right incumbent who got 43%, had brought “hate and strife” to Brazil. He will face Lula in a run-off on October 30th.

A jury in San Francisco convicted <strong>Uber’s</strong> former <strong>cyber-security</strong> chief of obstructing justice, for his efforts to hide from federal regulators a cyber-attack at the ride-hailing firm in 2016. Joseph Sullivan’s trial marked a rare criminal prosecution of a cyber-security executive for failing to report a breach. He faces up to eight years in prison on two charges.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>72, the number of ministers Peru’s president, Pedro Castillo, has gone through in just 14 months in office. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/09/29/peru-has-an-incompetent-president-and-a-discredited-congress).

## Could the Ukraine war turn nuclear?

The further Ukraine forces advance, the higher the risk that Russia will respond with [nuclear weapons](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/09/29/could-the-war-in-ukraine-go-nuclear). So America’s admonitions against doing so are becoming harsher. In September senior American officials warned Russia of “catastrophic” and “horrific” consequences if it went nuclear. Some whisper that America might then have to respond militarily, probably with conventional rather than nuclear weapons.

For months American officials said they detected no change in Russia’s nuclear posture. Now, less reassuringly, they see no change “that would cause us to alter our posture”. One recently said there was no sign of the “imminent” use of nukes. All this leaves open the possibility that America sees something stirring in Russia’s [nuclear establishment](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/14/do-russias-military-setbacks-increase-the-risk-of-nuclear-conflict), but is not reacting to it. One analyst has spotted movement in a unit that stores and transports Russian nuclear warheads. An Italian newspaper reported that Russia may soon test a nuclear-capable torpedo. Other officials insist these are false alarms. But the jitters are growing.

## Chasing Arizona’s political centre

Statewide elections in Arizona, where a third of voters claim no party affiliation, have recently been won by razor-thin margins. Yet Mark Kelly, the Democratic incumbent seeking re-election in November’s Senate race, comfortably leads his Republican rival. Independents seem unconvinced by Blake Masters, a venture capitalist whose racist dog-whistling during the primary secured him Donald Trump’s endorsement. So Mr Masters will try to soften his image, and broaden his appeal, when he debates Mr Kelly on Thursday.

Mr Kelly, by contrast, understands how to woo the political centre. Recognising that Democrats’ [perceived weakness on border security](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/10/04/the-biden-administration-is-quietly-completing-bits-of-donald-trumps-wall) could cost him votes, he takes a tough line on immigration. He supports building out the wall along Arizona’s border with Mexico and has co-sponsored a bill to help recruit and retain more border-patrol agents. That defensive posture should serve him well: <em>The Economist</em>’s [forecasting model](https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/us-midterms-2022/forecast/senate/arizona) gives him a 92% probability of winning on November 8th.

## A new European talking-shop

The leaders of 44 European countries are [gathering in Prague](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/06/meet-the-brand-new-european-political-community) on Thursday for the first meeting of the “European Political Community” (EPC). The format, floated by Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, allows for a [looser continental grouping](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/05/26/reheated-plans-for-a-multi-tiered-europe-revive-familiar-suspicions) of the EU’s 27 members alongside 17 outer-circle countries: aspiring members (Serbia, Ukraine), happy outsiders (Norway, Switzerland) or the recently departed (just Britain).

That is a tricky crowd to manage. The summit will feature different discussion streams to keep apart pairs of countries best not left in the same room, such as Greece and Turkey. But the EPC has received an early endorsement from [Liz Truss](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/07/can-liz-truss-fix-britain), Britain’s new prime minister, who will attend despite her country’s fluctuating relationship with the continent. EU leaders will stay on after the meeting ends to discuss tightening sanctions against Russia, after EU ambassadors approved a long-awaited deal for an oil-price cap on Wednesday. A closer-knit Europe, then, both in format and in substance.

## Disease and political turmoil flood Pakistan

Pakistan’s [devastating floods](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/09/15/devastating-floods-like-pakistans-will-be-more-common-in-a-warming-world) may be receding, but their costs are compounding. This week the UN raised its aid appeal for the country to $816m, up from $160m. The revision was prompted by fears of hunger and a surge in water-borne diseases. More than 140,000 cases of malaria were reported in its southern Sindh province in the first three weeks of September. Swathes of farmland remain submerged.

Pakistan’s government appears ill-equipped to cope. The climate minister, Sherry Rehman, has admitted that government coffers are running dry. The botched response is leaving officials red-faced. On Monday Shehbaz Sharif, the prime minister, refused to start using a government dashboard monitoring flood relief, saying it was shoddily designed. The opposition, led by Imran Khan, a former prime minister, is adding to Mr Sharif’s problems. Mr Khan has called on his party’s officials to assemble millions of supporters to descend on the capital this week to rally for fresh elections.

## “The Woman King”: a female-led African epic

Marvel Studios’s “Black Panther” proved that Hollywood could sell an action movie with an African setting and a predominantly black cast. “[The Woman King](https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2018/04/05/africas-past-is-inspiring-some-of-its-most-interesting-fiction-today)”, which is already out in American cinemas and released in Britain this week, goes one step further. Gina Prince-Bythewood, an American director, has made a rip-roaring historical epic, set in the prosperous west African kingdom of Dahomey (now part of Benin) in the 1800s, and populated it largely with black women.

Viola Davis, who won an Oscar for “Fences” in 2017, stars as General Nanisca, the leader of an all-female military regiment which defends Dahomey from neighbouring warlords. (The regiment actually existed; Nanisca didn’t.) Most of the key behind-the-camera roles are taken by women, too. While “The Woman King” is perhaps too forgiving of Dahomey’s part in the international [slave trade](https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2018/05/12/the-story-of-one-of-the-last-slaves-transported-to-america), otherwise it is inspirational: an historical epic that makes history.
