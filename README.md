 **Ukraine** and **Russia** signed a deal on Friday in Istanbul to resume **grain exports** from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. Brokered by the UN and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s president, the agreement should [unblock about 18m tonnes of Ukrainian grain](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/21/odessas-port-may-soon-be-reopened) awaiting export. Russia’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports has sent global food prices surging and exacerbated world hunger.

 **Herbert Diess** was ousted as chief executive of Volkswagen, following clashes with the company’s works council, which represents its employees. Mr Diess had tried to re-imagine VW as an electric-car maker, and to impose steep cost cuts. He will be replaced by Oliver Blume, CEO of Volkswagen’s Porsche brand.

 **Steve Bannon** was convicted of two charges of contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the House committee [investigating the Capitol riot](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/06/08/americas-probe-into-the-capitol-riot-is-needed-before-its-too-late) on January 6th 2021. Mr Bannon, a former adviser to Donald Trump, faces between 30 days and one year in prison, as well as fines up to $100,000, on each count. He will be sentenced in October.

The Biden administration authorised another **weapons** delivery to **Ukraine,** worth $270m. An American official said that hundreds of Russian soldiers are dying each day in the war; earlier the CIA estimated that 15,000 had been killed so far. Separately, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, told the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> that he would not countenance any [ceasefire](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/05/26/when-and-how-might-the-war-in-ukraine-end) that let Russia retain territory it had taken.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

Gavin Newsom, **California’s** governor, approved legislation authorising private citizens to sue people who violate the state’s **gun laws** . Individuals will be able to seek damages starting at $10,000 from illegal-firearms dealers. The enforcement mechanism mimics one devised in Texas to [target abortion providers](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2021/09/11/texass-bounty-hunting-abortion-law-could-remain-on-the-books-for-a-long-time). The Supreme Court let Texas’s law take effect; Mr Newsom dared the court to block California’s.

 **Euro-zone business activity** went into reverse in July for the first time since February 2021. S&amp;P Global’s flash composite purchasing managers’ index, which measures both service sector and manufacturing companies in the euro zone, dropped to a 17-month low of 49.4 in July, a fall from 52 in June. Economists had expected a slight decline to 51, but the drop below 50, which indicates contraction, was unexpected.

Riot police removed protesters from the area around the president’s office in Colombo, **Sri Lanka** ’s capital, hours after [Ranil Wickremesinghe](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/07/21/sri-lanka-picks-a-new-president-to-replace-the-one-that-fled) was sworn in as president. Demonstrators have camped out there for months amid an economic crisis. There are fears that the show of force will reignite unrest. Meanwhile Dinesh Gunawardena, a senior lawmaker, was sworn in as the new prime minister.

 **Fact of the day:** three, the number of days each year that the average European has experienced temperatures above 38°C over the past five years.

## Trump plays kingmaker in Arizona

Donald Trump considers Blake Masters, a venture capitalist, to be “a great modern-day thinker!” On Friday the former president will [host a rally](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/07/21/the-january-6th-committee-has-hobbled-donald-trump) in Arizona alongside Mr Masters, who hopes to secure the Republican nomination for the upcoming Senate contest in the November mid-term elections. Together they will set out their plans to “save America”, as Friday’s rally is called.

Republicans aim to take the Senate at the mid-terms, and Arizona is one of the few competitive seats up for grabs. With Mr Trump’s backing, Mr Masters has a good chance of winning the GOP primary on August 2nd. Four-fifths of Republican candidates endorsed by Mr Trump in open primary contests have won their party’s nomination. But Mr Masters may fare less well in the general election. He recently claimed black people are responsible for gun violence and obliquely endorsed the so-called “[great replacement theory](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/05/16/what-is-the-great-replacement-right-wing-conspiracy-theory)”, warning that Democrats were aiming to “change the demographics of our country”. Polling suggests Mr Masters would lose to Mark Kelly, the Democratic incumbent, in November. Mr Trump may once again be leading his party astray.

## Russia’s long economic war

Any good general understands the importance of morale in a [protracted conflict](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/06/30/does-a-protracted-conflict-favour-russia-or-ukraine). So does Russia’s central bank. After the invasion of Ukraine in February, the bank acted decisively to show it was in control, doubling interest rates to 20% to save the rouble. As the currency stabilised, since then it has brought rates back down to 9.5%, in four large cuts. On Friday the bank slashed rates once again, by a larger-than-expected 1.5 percentage points.

While much of the world is [raising rates](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/07/18/how-american-banks-are-responding-to-rising-interest-rates) amid soaring prices, Russia can get away with easing. That is because after the initial shock of sanctions, high energy prices have buoyed [the economy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/06/10/russias-economy-appears-to-be-back-on-track). The rouble has strengthened against the dollar, helped by a ban on taking money out of the country. 

Inflation is slowing, too. That, though, is partly because Russians are buying less as Western goods disappear from the shelves. Eventually the stun-gunned economy will become less productive, real incomes will fall, and Russia’s central bankers will have to work harder to rally the troops.

## Twitter’s limbo earnings

Twitter’s results on Friday were characteristically gloomy. The company reported a drop in revenue from a year earlier and a $66m profit last year swung to a $270m loss. Yet investors still have bigger things to worry about. They will be focused on the social-media platform’s messy legal dispute with Elon Musk, the billionaire who tried to buy the firm before changing his mind.

Twitter’s product, user numbers and revenues have [long been disappointing](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/07/11/with-or-without-elon-musk-twitter-is-overdue-a-shake-up). But Mr Musk’s expression of interest in buying the firm in April plunged Twitter into chaos. Staff revolted at the idea of working for a plutocrat. The promise of a $44bn payout for shareholders kept things moving. But earlier this month Mr Musk rescinded his offer.

Twitter is now in the unenviable position of trying to force a reluctant buyer to seal the deal. Its lawsuit against Mr Musk is off to a good start: despite his attempts to delay the trial until next year, a judge has ordered a hearing for October. In arguing against the delay Twitter’s lawyers said that the protracted uncertainty “inflicts harm on Twitter every hour of every day”.

## A Tory summer roadshow

Friday marks the first day of summer recess for Britain’s parliament. It returns on September 5th, the day the country will also learn the name of their new prime minister.

On Wednesday Conservative MPs finished whittling down a longlist of contenders to replace Boris Johnson as the [leader of their party](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/07/20/rishi-sunak-and-liz-truss-will-battle-to-be-britains-next-prime-minister) to two: Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, and Liz Truss, the foreign secretary. Both claim to be Thatcherites, but they are split on fiscal policy. She wants big tax cuts now, whereas he insists they must wait until inflation is tamed. [They differ in style](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/07/21/the-choice-between-rishi-sunak-and-liz-truss), too. Ms Truss is not a fluent public speaker while Mr Sunak is polished, albeit sometimes prickly. Their campaigns have kicked into gear: on Thursday, the candidates tried to win over Conservative councillors at a private event in London.

It is now up to the Conservative Party’s roughly 180,000 members to pick a winner. In an attempt to woo them Mr Sunak and Ms Truss will now spend the summer traipsing up and down the country for 12 hustings. The tour will kick off in Leeds—Ms Truss’ hometown—on July 28th. She is currently the favourite, and that might give her another advantage.

## “Nope” is a maybe

Jordan Peele, the writer and director of “Us” and “Get Out”—which earned him an Oscar for best original screenplay—has made another comedy-drama with a very short title: “Nope”, released in America on Friday.

Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer star as siblings who spot a flying saucer. Desperate for money, they set about becoming the first people to take an irrefutable photograph of an alien spaceship. Despite that simple premise the film is the most wide-ranging of Mr Peele’s oeuvre. “Nope” is sprinkled with interludes concerning the Wild West, animal training, child stars, social media and the erasure of black people from Hollywood history—all of which are shot beautifully by cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, of “Interstellar” and “Dunkirk”.

The result is intriguing, if sometimes rambling. Mr Peele struggles to weave everything together. But he is the rare Hollywood filmmaker who has too many ideas, rather than not enough.
