The <strong>Democrats</strong> retained control of the <strong>Senate</strong> after Catherine Cortez Masto was elected for a Nevada seat. That gives the party 50 seats in the upper house, with only Georgia, which has gone to a run-off, still to declare. Ms Cortez Mastro beat Adam Laxalt, a Donald Trump-endorsed Republican, emphasising what a [torrid midterms](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/10/after-the-midterms-america-and-its-democracy-look-stronger) the former president’s picks have endured.

The result followed that in <strong>Arizona</strong>, in which Mark Kelly, the Democratic incumbent, beat Blake Masters, another Trump endorsee. The Republicans, however, still look favourites to flip the House of Representatives, although with a smaller majority than they had originally hoped for. With some vote-counts proceeding at a glacial pace, the full results for the lower chamber may not be known for days.

<strong>Israel’s</strong> president, Isaac Herzog, gave <strong>Binyamin Netanyahu</strong>, a former prime minister, a mandate to form a new government. In an election on November 1st a pro-Netanyahu bloc won 64 out of 120 seats in the Knesset. Mr Natanyahu’s [government](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/10/the-changing-nature-of-israeli-politics) is expected to include far-right and religious parties including the Jewish Power party led by [Itamar Ben-Gvir](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/11/03/who-is-itamar-ben-gvir-israels-kingmaker), an extremist long excluded from mainstream politics.

Turkey’s vice-president, Fuat Oktay, said an explosion in <strong>Istanbul</strong>, which killed six people and injured more than 50, was thought to have been caused by a female suicide bomber. Videos show flames and a loud bang on Istiklal Avenue, a shopping street which is popular with locals and tourists.

<strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in his daily address that authorities in the city of <strong>Kherson</strong> had discovered thousands of mines and shells left by <strong>Russian</strong> troops, who withdrew [on Friday](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/11/russia-claims-to-have-completed-its-withdrawal-from-kherson). Much of the city’s critical infrastructure was also destroyed and supplies of bread and medicine are running out. Russia announced that Genichesk, a town 180km away on the Sea of Azov, would become the temporary administrative capital of Kherson province.

Vladimir Putin, the president of <strong>Russia</strong>, and Ebrahim Raisi, his <strong>Iranian </strong>counterpart, held a phone call to discuss political, trade and economic co-operation between their countries. At an earlier meeting, on Wednesday, Iranian and Russian security officials shared measures to combat “Western interference” in their internal affairs. Both countries are facing [discontent](https://te.arielherself.xyz/films/2022/11/08/is-iran-on-the-edge-of-a-revolution) at home and are subject to Western sanctions.

<strong>Janet Yellen</strong>, America’s treasury secretary, indicated she would quiz the head of China’s national bank about whether China plans to loosen its zero-covid policy and how it would deal with its property-market crisis. Ms Yellen is due to meet <strong>Yi Gang</strong> at the G20 summit in Bali on Monday. China recorded nearly 15,000 new covid infections on Saturday—a hefty caseload by its recent standards.

## Bali’s battery bonanza gets under way

In the days before the G20 summit of global leaders kicks off on Tuesday, Indonesia, the host country, has a rare chance to market its business opportunities to the world. The “B20” summit, organised by the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, gets under way in Bali on Sunday.

Despite Indonesia’s huge population, its economy has been overshadowed by growth stars like China and Vietnam. But the country contains 21m tons of nickel, more than a fifth of the world’s supply. The metal is a crucial component of the batteries required for electric vehicles.

The government wants to find backers for industry rather than simply to export raw nickel. LG and Hyundai, which are Korean electronics companies, and CATL, a Chinese battery giant, have already made large investments in battery production. The next company Indonesian officials want to lure is Tesla. Conversations between the government and Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive (and Twitter’s new owner), are under way, But it is not yet clear whether the top tweeter can be tempted to invest some of Tesla’s billions in the archipelago.

## Slovenia is likely to elect its first female president

Barring a political earthquake Slovenes will elect Natasa Pirc Musar as their first female president on Sunday. Ms Pirc Musar, a centre-left candidate, came second in the first round of the poll on October 23rd, behind Anze Logar, a candidate of the right. Mr Logar is a close associate of Janez Jansa, the Trump-admiring former prime minister who still wields great clout. According to pollsters, Mr Logar has failed to win over many beyond Mr Jansa’s supporters, whereas Ms Pirc Musar should pick up most of the centre-left vote, which was split in the first round. 

Borut Pahor, the outgoing president, stood by as Mr Jansa became increasingly autocratic before he lost an election last April to Robert Golob, a far more liberal politician. The Slovenian president has limited powers, but an active one can be influential by holding the government to account. Ms Pirc Musar, a lawyer who ran as an independent, aims to reinvigorate the office.

## How beavers improve water quality

Before Europeans arrived, 10% of North America was submerged under fresh water. That is what 400m beavers—the dam-building population back then—will do to a continent. Today, climate change is making North America hotter and drier. Droughts cause contaminants to build up and degrade water quality. But new research in <em>Nature Communications</em>, a journal, reveals how nature’s own hydrologic engineers are coming to the rescue.

Ecologists found that beavers’ prolific construction counteracts the damage done by more extreme seasons. Their dams raise the water level upstream, flooding the surrounding riparian zone. This zone acts as a filter, purifying fresh water before it re-enters the main waterway downstream. Water tests reveal that a beaver dam removes one contaminant, nitrate, even more efficiently than unnaturally heavy rainfall. When humans alter their environment, nature often has a way of providing a counterbalance. The ever-industrious beaver is exactly that.

## Pakistan falls short at a cricket world cup

What a rotten year it has been for Pakistan. From [devastating floods](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/30/pakistan-has-been-hit-by-its-worst-floods-in-recent-memory) to a [crumbling economy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/07/28/pakistan-may-be-able-to-avoid-a-full-blown-economic-crisis) to the [attempted assassination](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/11/03/imran-khan-pakistans-ex-prime-minister-survives-an-attempt-on-his-life) of a former prime minister, Imran Khan, little has gone right.

Add to that defeat to England in the final of cricket’s T20 world cup in Melbourne on Sunday. It is glib, of course, to compare an athletic failure with those other disasters. But to a nation so obsessed with the sport, victory would have provided a welcome chance to celebrate. 

It was not to be. Despite an under-par batting display, the country’s fearsome battery of bowlers made England sweat for every run in front of an 80,000-strong crowd—nearly all of them, judging by the din, supporting Pakistan. Before the game Mr Khan, himself one of the country’s greatest ever cricketers, told the team that all he expected of them was to fight to the end. That, they certainly did.

## Weekend profile: Alaa Abd el-Fattah, Egypt’s prisoner of conscience

In 2011 [Alaa Abd el-Fattah](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/11/09/who-is-alaa-abd-el-fattah) turned 30 in a Cairo jail. He spent his 40th birthday behind bars, too. In fact, the human-rights activist has marked many of life’s milestones from inside a cell: his son’s birth, his father’s death. Again in custody, he is Egypt’s most high-profile [political prisoner](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/07/18/egypt-locks-up-terrorists-but-wont-say-which-terror-group-they-belong-to)—and a source of international embarrassment to its thuggish government.

Egypt had hoped to use COP27, the UN climate conference taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh, to polish its image. But Mr Abd el-Fattah, who recently escalated a months-long hunger strike by refusing water, is making that impossible. America’s president, Joe Biden, raised Mr Abd el-Fattah’s case with his Egyptian counterpart on Friday. Many other leaders and luminaries have called for his release.

Mr Abd el-Fattah was born to Egyptian intellectuals with an activist bent. Imprisonment prevented his father from attending the birth of his daughter, the beginning of a dark family tradition. Mr Abd el-Fattah’s first taste of protest came in 2005, when Egyptians decried election-rigging by the government of Hosni Mubarak, the dictator who ruled from 1981 to 2011. By 2011, when the Arab spring swept the Middle East, Mr Abd el-Fattah had become a leader of Egypt’s uprising. After General Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi helped topple a democratically elected government in 2013 he was arrested again, for allegedly organising against a new law banning protests. He has since spent most of his time in prison.

Mr Abd el-Fattah’s confrontation with the Egyptian regime may now be reaching a climax. In December he received a five-year prison sentence for “undermining national security”. He has been on hunger strike for more than 200 days and has refused water since last weekend. On Thursday his sister said authorities had started a “medical intervention”. The government is happy to let him die, she insisted, but not “while the world is watching”. All the more reason to pay attention.
