As military drills around <strong>Taiwan</strong> entered their last scheduled day on Sunday, China announced further exercises in the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea. During its most provocative wargames in decades China [fired missiles](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/08/04/china-sends-missiles-flying-over-taiwan) over Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, and sent warships across the median line. The island’s government also accused China of simulating an invasion. On August 5th China halted talks with America on several topics following the [visit](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/03/nancy-pelosi-has-left-taiwan-the-real-crisis-may-be-just-beginning) of Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of America’s House of Representatives, to Taiwan earlier in the week.

<strong>Israeli</strong> air strikes on the <strong>Gaza Strip</strong> killed 24 people, including six children, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Several members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militant group—including two of its leaders, Tayseer al-Jaabari and Khaled Mansour—were among the dead. Israel arrested 19 PIJ members and warned that its operation could last for a week. Hundreds of rockets have been fired at Israel from Gaza since Friday, according to an Israeli official, although there have been no casualties.

<strong>Democrats</strong> in America’s <strong>Senate </strong>voted along party lines to open debate on their signature climate, tax and health-care legislation. The bill could pass the chamber as soon as Sunday, with the House of Representatives expected to take it up next week. The law would [reduce emissions](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/07/28/democratic-hopes-for-a-big-spending-bill-are-revived), raise corporate taxes and enable the government to [negotiate lower drug prices](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2021/11/20/democrats-have-a-plan-to-lower-drug-costs-without-hurting-innovation) on behalf of over-65s.

A foreign-flagged ship arrived in <strong>Ukraine</strong> to be loaded up with <strong>grain</strong> for the first time since Russia invaded. Its presence in Odessa is a result of the [UN-brokered deal](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/01/the-first-grain-ship-leaves-odessa-under-a-un-brokered-deal) to resume grain exports. Officials hope to receive at least three and five ships a day within two weeks, and to export 3m tonnes of grain a month from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Russia</strong> and <strong>Ukraine</strong> blamed each other for shelling at the Zaporizhzhia <strong>nuclear</strong> <strong>plant</strong> in southern Ukraine. The UN’s nuclear watchdog said artillery exchange near the facility amounted to “playing with fire”, and called for the “utmost restraint”. Shelling on Friday prompted Ukrainian technicians at the power station to disconnect one of its six reactors. Europe’s largest nuclear plant, [Zaporizhzhia](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/03/04/europes-largest-nuclear-plant-shuts-down-after-a-russian-attack) was captured by Russian forces in March.

Eli Lilly, an American drugmaker that is among <strong>Indiana’s </strong>largest employers, said that a near-total <strong>abortion ban</strong> passed by the state on Friday will force it to shift hiring elsewhere. Cummins, an engine manufacturer with headquarters in Indiana, said it would select “welcoming and inclusive environments” when deciding where to add jobs. The law takes effect on September 15th.

Warren Buffett’s company, <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>, reported a loss of nearly $44bn in the second quarter of 2022. The value of its investments sank by $53bn, with big drops in the share price of three of its biggest investments: American Express, Apple and Bank of America. Berkshire Hathaway’s operating earnings (Mr Buffett’s preferred measure, which excludes the undulations of share prices) rose to $9.3bn. Profits also rose at many of the 90 or so companies that the firm owns outright.

<strong>Word of the week:</strong> <em>Ganbei</em>, a Chinese term meaning “drink up”. The word is often used when people try to bring up life under China’s covid-19 lockdowns, according to one psychologist.

## A resurgence of violence in Gaza

On Friday Israel launched a series of strikes on Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip. It is the first major spate of violence in the beleaguered coastal enclave since an 11-day conflict in May 2021. At least 24 people in Gaza have been killed. In retaliation, the militants have fired hundreds of mortar shells towards Israel, according to the Israeli armed forces. Many have been intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome missile-defence system; there have been no Israeli casualties so far.

Israel claims it struck pre-emptively. It is targeting Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a small outfit backed by Iran. Hamas, a much bigger Islamic movement which rules Gaza, has stayed out of the fighting thus far. That is reason to hope that the flurry of attacks may cease within days. But that may not come to pass. Gaza has been under siege by Israel and Egypt since 2007, when Hamas took control in a coup. Its history shows that escalations can be rapid, and ceasefires tenuous.

## Anglicanism reveals its deep divisions

Sunday marks the end of the Lambeth Conference, a decennial meeting of Anglican bishops in Canterbury and London that is part Bible study, part plenary discussion. The bishops, who shepherd 85m worshippers worldwide, spent 12 days discussing the direction of their church in the 21st century. But they leave the conference with conflicting ideas about the next ten years of the church—especially on gay rights.

A draft motion called on bishops to reaffirm Resolution 1.10, a controversial text from the 1998 Lambeth Conference that rejected “homosexual practice as incompatible with scripture.” Lambeth motions are not binding, but carry sway within the church. This year’s proposal was eventually softened. But the Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches, which represents around 75% of the faithful and focuses on parts of the world (such as Africa) where the denomination’s reach is growing, released its own text in support of Resolution 1.10. Like the much larger [Roman Catholic](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/07/14/catholic-reformers-want-big-changes-to-a-church-marred-by-sex-abuse) church, Anglicans face a gaping divide between reformers and traditionalists.

## All eyes on Taiwan’s performing arts

As China holds [massive live-fire exercises around Taiwan](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/08/04/china-sends-missiles-flying-over-taiwan), the island’s capital will open the new Taipei Performing Arts Centre on Sunday. The futuristic complex, designed by star Dutch architects, is set amid one of the city’s busiest night markets. Among other things it will give Taipei sorely needed theatre space, especially as two of the centre’s stages can be merged into a 2,300-seat “super theatre”, as well as breathing room for avant-garde works, which have previously been confined to open or industrial spaces. 

Rem Koolhaas and David Gianotten, the architects of the centre, tell <em>The Economist</em> that Taiwan’s 24m people see theatre as especially relevant to their lives. The island’s troubled history and blend of eastern and western influences spark creative dynamics, they argue. The centre’s inaugural season of 142 performances will reflect that. It will include both classical acts, such as Wei Hai-min, a superstar of Peking opera, a style of performance popular around China, as well as more adventurous shows, such as a new work for Dance Forum Taipei, a contemporary Taiwanese dance company, by Marina Mascarell, a renowned Spanish choreographer.

## A new airline takes off in India

Tycoons have always been lured by the airline business. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, a billionaire Indian investor, is the latest example. On Sunday Mr Jhunjhunwala’s venture, Akasa (“sky”) Air, takes off with a flight between Mumbai and Ahmedabad. The airline’s goal is to become “India’s greenest, most dependable and most affordable airline”. To get there, it plans to procure 20 jets by the end of 2023. Cabin crew will don bright-orange uniforms made from recycled fabric and branded sneakers, a first for an Indian airline. 

But merely becoming profitable will be the biggest challenge. Competition among low-cost airlines in India is fierce. With lockdowns lifted, passenger demand has soared. But so have fuel costs. Caps on fares have also squeezed margins. Staff are disgruntled with wages, and airlines are struggling to hire more workers. Customers are also fed up: 80% of Indian passengers in a recent survey said that airline service in the country is terrible. Akasa faces a turbulent start.

## Weekend profile: Gustavo Petro, a former guerrilla and Colombia’s next president

Latin America is known for leftist revolutionaries, from Che Guevara to Hugo Chávez. Yet a leftist ruler was once unthinkable in Colombia. For 52 years the government was at war with a Marxist guerrilla movement called the [FARC](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/07/07/some-ex-farc-guerrillas-have-become-tourist-guides-in-colombia). By 2016, when the armed conflict ended, it had become the longest in the Western hemisphere. But on Sunday Gustavo Petro [assumes the presidency](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/06/20/how-gustavo-petro-a-former-guerrilla-might-govern-colombia) of Colombia.

As a 17-year-old Mr Petro joined the April 19th Movement, an urban guerrilla group known as the M-19. A low-level functionary, in 1985 he was in prison for allegedly storing weapons when the M-19 stormed Colombia’s Supreme Court. The arrival of the army resulted in a shootout, in which about half of the court’s judges were killed in crossfire, along with nearly 100 other people (Mr Petro appears to have had no involvement in the event).

After M-19 demobilised in 1990, Mr Petro entered politics. He became famous as a congressman for exposing links between politicians and right-wing paramilitary groups, and for calling out corruption. But he was less successful as mayor of Bogotá, Colombia’s capital, a job he held from 2012 to 2015. Mr Petro developed a reputation as a dictatorial boss and was briefly suspended after mismanaging the municipal restructuring of a private rubbish-collection service.

Today Mr Petro still harbours some of his youthful idealism. He has promised to provide all unemployed Colombians—11% of the labour force—with a state job, and to make public higher education free. He wants to prohibit new licences for oil and gas exploration, though extractive industries make up around half of Colombia’s exports. Yet Mr Petro’s revolutionary spirit has been somewhat tempered. He picked José Antonio Ocampo, a moderate who is sceptical about offering state jobs to the unemployed, as his finance minister. Mr Ocampo will serve alongside several other centrist ministers.

And since the election in June Mr Petro has focused on building support among the established parties he once denounced. He has even met his arch-nemesis, Álvaro Uribe, a powerful right-wing former president. Most of Colombia’s big parties have promised to back Mr Petro. That may give him the parliamentary majority he needs to pass reforms, including a tax bill that will be his first major test in government. The rebel has become the peacemaker.
