**American retail sales** rebounded strongly in June, easing some fears about a coming recession. Commerce-department data showed that retail sales rose 1% last month, better than the 0.8% gain forecast by economists. Wall Street’s S&amp;P 500 share index rose almost 2%, though it still closed slightly below where it started the week. 

 **America’s** president, Joe Biden, offered a fist bump to Muhammad bin Salman, **Saudi Arabia’s** crown prince, upon their meeting in Jeddah. Mr Biden once vowed to make the kingdom a “pariah” after [Jamal Khashoggi](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/02/26/the-cia-blames-mbs-for-the-murder-of-jamal-khashoggi), a journalist, was kidnapped and murdered by the Saudi government in 2018. The two leaders were expected to discuss oil supply and regional security. Mr Biden also hailed a decision by the Saudis to open their airspace to all civilian carriers—including flights from Israel.

Mr Biden vowed to use executive action to cut **greenhouse-gas emissions** after climate-change legislation stalled in America’s Senate. Joe Manchin, a Democratic senator for West Virginia and frequent foil to the Biden administration, said on Thursday that he would not support the inclusion of clean-energy incentives in a [social-spending bill](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/12/19/joe-manchin-kills-the-build-back-better-act-joe-bidens-ambitious-legislative-package). Mr Biden urged the Senate to pass the bill, even without the climate bits, to reform [prescription-drugs pricing](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/11/20/democrats-have-a-plan-to-lower-drug-costs-without-hurting-innovation).

Officials across **Europe** issued **health warnings** as temperatures are expected to soar over the next few days, surpassing 40℃ in several places. Britain issued its first-ever “extreme heat” warning. Thousands of people have already been evacuated from homes to escape wildfires in France, Portugal and Spain.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

The **World Health Organisation** reported the “largest sustained decline” in the administering of **childhood vaccines** for 30 years. According to official data, the number of youngsters receiving three doses of DTP3, which vaccinates against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, fell by five percentage points between 2019 and 2021. The WHO blamed disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic for some of the decline.

An autopsy revealed that **Jayland Walker** , a black man killed by police in **Ohio** last month, was struck by gunfire at least 46 times. Mr Walker had fled police when a reportedly routine traffic stop went wrong. Hundreds of people mourned at his funeral this week in Akron, where regular protests are ongoing despite an indefinite curfew.

 **Jim Thorpe** , a Native American of the Sac and Fox nation, was named the sole gold medallist of the decathlon and pentathlon for the **Olympic games** —in 1912. <em>Indian Country Today</em> reported that the International Olympic Committee restored the full honours that it stripped from Thorpe in 1913 on the grounds that a brief stint as a paid baseball player [disqualified him from amateur competition](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/07/20/why-did-the-olympics-ditch-their-amateur-athlete-requirement).

## Realpolitik in Arabia

After the rapture of Joe Biden’s pilgrimage to [Israel](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/07/12/what-does-the-middle-east-offer-america)—land of biblical prophets, democracy and tech—comes penitence in Saudi Arabia. America’s president once vowed to make the country “a pariah”. Now he must beseech it to pump more oil to bring down global prices.

Mr Biden has some fig-leaves. One is that his self-mortification will help Israel, by pushing the Saudis towards normalisation and isolating Iran. A second is that he is not really visiting Saudi Arabia on Friday, but attending a summit of Arab countries in Jeddah. A third is that the risk of covid means he will not not be shaking hands with anyone, least of all Muhammad bin Salman, the crown prince.

Alas, the Saudis will not go much further in embracing Israel until it makes peace with the Palestinians. And they remain aligned with Russia on oil policy. As for avoiding physical contact, the tactile Mr Biden already abandoned fist-bumps in Israel. The president’s discomfort in Saudi will be plain to see.

## Counting the cost of covid in China

Cases of covid-19 have edged up in China this month, making everyone nervous about future [lockdowns](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/06/14/beijing-and-shanghai-are-still-trying-to-get-a-grip-on-covid-19). Some residents of Shanghai were briefly confined to their buildings in recent days, an unwelcome reprise of their [torment](https://www.economist.com/1843/2022/04/26/locked-down-in-shanghai-ive-caught-a-glimpse-of-our-techno-dystopian-future) in April and May, when the city imposed a hastily executed and harshly enforced lockdown. The [economic damage](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/06/09/it-will-take-time-for-chinas-consumers-to-recover-from-lockdown) such measures can inflict was plain to see in GDP figures released on Friday.

China’s economy grew by only 0.4% in the second quarter, compared with a year earlier. (Compared with the previous quarter, it shrank by 2.6%.) The government is lining up over 7trn yuan ($1trn) of financing for a recovery effort in the remainder of the year, according to Morgan Stanley, a bank. But every time the economy tries to bounce back, the virus stages a recovery of its own.

## An extraordinary meeting in Russia

Russia’s parliament mostly exists to rubber-stamp decisions made by the president, Vladimir Putin. His party, United Russia, controls 325 of the 450 seats. So the fact that members of the Duma were told to return from their summer holidays early for an extraordinary meeting on Friday could spell trouble for Ukraine.  
  
 The parliamentary leader of United Russia said at least 60 items are on the agenda. One of them is to confirm the promotion of Denis Manturov, the trade and industry minister, to deputy prime minister. Mr Manturov will have a mandate to revive Russia’s industrial capacity. This could signal increased economic mobilisation for the war. On July 5th the Duma passed a bill compelling Russian businesses to aid the military effort if necessary. Two days later Mr Putin suggested to the chamber’s leaders that what he calls Russia’s “special military operation” in Ukraine has yet to start “in earnest”. Ukraine and the West will hope that amounts to little more than bluster.

## A rocket under Ukraine’s defences

Ukraine’s armed forces are eagerly awaiting further deliveries of a weapon which might tilt the war in their favour. America has already donated eight High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS). Britain is supplying some too. 

Each HIMARS launcher fires GPS-guided missiles up to 84km. And they are making an immediate impact. Around 20 Russian ammunition dumps on Ukrainian soil have gone boom since the first rockets arrived in late June. So have barracks and command posts. Ukrainian commanders are delighted. Russia might adapt by dispersing and disguising its headquarters and depots. But this could make it trickier to get artillery ammunition to the frontlines.

And things could get worse for the Russians. America has not—yet—sent M77 anti-artillery rounds, which can disperse 8,000 bomblets in fewer than 60 seconds. Nor has it provided the longest-range munitions, known as ATACMS, which can be fired 300km. That would put every single Russian soldier in Ukraine in the crosshairs.

## Medallion women, and men, in Oregon

A clean sweep by a national team in the 100m sprint, the highlight of the World Athletics Championships, is almost unheard of. But at this year’s competition, which begins in Oregon on Friday, it could happen in both the men’s and the women’s races.

Three female Jamaican sprinters, Elaine Thompson-Herah, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson, filled the podium at the Tokyo Olympics last summer. And they have run the five fastest times in the world so far this year.

In the men’s competition, Team USA has four contenders. Fred Kerley won silver in Tokyo and is the only man to have run under 9.8 seconds this year. Trayvon Bromell, who was favourite in Tokyo before crashing out in the semi-finals, has the second fastest time this year. Marvin Bracy and Christian Coleman, the defending 100m champion, are also in the running. And Lamont Marcell Jacobs, the Italian who beat them all at the Olympics, has been struggling with injuries ever since.
