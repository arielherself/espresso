America’s <strong>House of Representatives</strong> approved legislation that mandates federal recognition of <strong>same-sex marriages</strong>. Lawmakers from both parties voted in favour, bringing the result to 258-169. The bill had already been approved by the House in July, but was revised in the Senate to address Republican concerns that it would damage religious freedom, bringing it back to the House for another vote. President Joe Biden will now need to sign the legislation into law.

America’s Federal Trade Commission sued to block Microsoft from [buying](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/11/29/microsoft-activision-blizzard-and-the-future-of-gaming) <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong>, a video-game studio. The trustbuster [fears](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/12/01/trustbusters-should-let-microsoft-buy-activision-blizzard) that Microsoft will “harm competition” by making Activision games, such as “Call of Duty”, exclusively available on the Xbox, Microsoft’s console. Microsoft insists the deal would expand competition. Its $69bn offer for Activision would be its biggest-ever acquisition. 

Russia exchanged American basketball star <strong>Brittney</strong> <strong>Griner</strong> for <strong>Viktor Bout</strong>, a notorious arms dealer, in a prisoner swap reportedly approved by President Joe Biden. [Ms Griner](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/08/05/how-do-prisoner-swaps-work) was arrested in Moscow in February for possessing cannabis oil and spent time in a Russian penal colony. [Mr Bout](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/12/08/who-is-viktor-bout), dubbed the “merchant of death”, spent 12 years in an American jail for conspiring to support terrorists and kill Americans.

<strong>Beijing</strong> is fighting its first significant <strong>covid</strong> outbreak after the Chinese government eased pandemic restrictions in a retreat from its zero-covid strategy. Surging cases are putting pressure on China’s health-care system, which has limited resources. Reports emerged on Thursday that hospitals in Beijing are facing shortages of fever medication and rapid antigen tests. The outbreak could spread further next month, as millions of [Chinese could take the disease with them](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/12/07/china-is-loosening-its-covid-restrictions-at-great-risk) when they return to their hometowns to celebrate the lunar new year.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>President Xi Jinping</strong> announced a “new era” in [China’s relationship with the Gulf ](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/07/the-gulf-looks-to-china)states as his country and <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> agreed a series of strategic deals in Riyadh. Mr Xi met Muhammad Bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, before signing off on 34 investments in sectors including technology and energy. The two countries’ leaders will meet every two years.

<strong>Iran</strong> has executed the first prisoner known to be convicted for crimes related to [the current nationwide protests](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/18/irans-protests-spread-as-a-notorious-prison-burns), according to state media reports. Mohsen Shekari, described as a “rioter” by officials, was executed for allegedly injuring a security guard with a machete. On Monday Iran’s Revolutionary Guards called on the judiciary to issue swift judgments against those accused of “crimes against the security of the nation and Islam”.

The EU’s top court ruled that <strong>Google</strong> must remove data from its search engine results if users can prove it is “manifestly inaccurate”. The case before the Court of Justice of the European Union concerned two executives who wanted [Google](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2020/07/30/google-has-outgrown-its-corporate-culture) to remove search results linking them to criticism of their group’s investment model. Google had initially refused to remove the content.

## Disney tries to make streaming pay

By one measure Disney is a big success in [streaming](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/disney-netflix-apple-is-anyone-winning-the-streaming-wars/21807591). In just three years its Disney+ service has signed up 164m members. The company has 236m active subscriptions to Disney+ and its other streaming platforms, Hulu and ESPN+. That is even more than Netflix, until recently the market leader.

The only snag is that the business bleeds money. Last quarter Disney lost $1.5bn on streaming, more than twice as much as in the same quarter last year. That hastened the sacking of its [chief executive](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/11/23/what-disney-can-learn-from-elton-john), Bob Chapek, on November 20th.

On Thursday Disney puts into practice its new plan for [restoring profitability](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/21/disney-brings-back-a-star-of-the-past-but-its-real-problem-is-the-script). Disney+ in America will be punctuated by advertising for the first time. Viewers will have to pay $10.99 a month, 38% more than the current ad-free subscription price, to avoid ads. They may moan, but with Netflix launching ads last month there is no escape: streamers are determined to make the business pay.

## Times of trouble for the news

Sixty years ago on Thursday, hundreds of printers stopped operating their machines at the <em>New York Times</em> and went on strike. The number of strikers eventually swelled to 17,000, including reporters, photoengravers and elevator operators from seven daily papers in New York. The walkout lasted 114 days and killed four papers.

On Thursday a similar coalition of 1,100 <em>Times</em> employees began a 24-hour stoppage in the hopes of securing higher wages. It comes at a [difficult time](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/04/16/startups-aim-to-reinvigorate-local-news-in-america) for American media organisations, many of which are shedding staff in anticipation of an [economic downturn](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/the-american-economy-is-set-for-a-downturn-not-a-crisis)—though the <em>Times</em> continues to report substantial profits.

The <em>Times</em>, which has more paying digital subscribers than any other English-language paper in the world, has not sought a deal to avert the strike. The strikers will not slay the Gray Lady, but could fire up other disgruntled workers in the troubled industry.

## Wirecard’s former bosses go on trial

Two-and-a-half years ago [Wirecard](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2020/06/25/how-wirecard-fooled-most-of-the-people-all-of-the-time) collapsed into bankruptcy after admitting that the €1.9bn ($2bn) the company was meant to have stored away in offshore escrow accounts “probably” did “not exist”. On Thursday Markus Braun, the payment-processing firm’s Austrian former chief executive, and two other leaders will begin to stand trial at a court in Munich. Several key suspects will not be present. Jan Marsalek, the firm’s COO, is on the run.

The trial for fraud at a company once seen as a star of Germany’s tech sector is expected to last more than a year. After an investigation that lasted more than 20 months, prosecutors allege that Mr Braun and his accomplices stole more than €255m of Wirecard funds, mainly through fake loans, and doctored accounts to dupe banks and other creditors. (He has denied any knowledge of manipulated accounts.) They are charged with fraud, accounting irregularities and embezzlement on a large scale. Just reading out all the charges will take around five hours.

## A cloudy forecast for Japan’s economy

The [world’s third-largest economy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/07/14/the-legacy-of-abe-shinzo-will-shape-japans-economy-for-years) is not doing well. Revised GDP figures released on Thursday showed that Japan’s economy shrank by an annualised 0.8% in the third quarter of 2022. Economists had predicted an expansion, but a surge in coronavirus infections over the summer and higher inflation, caused partly by a decline in the value of the yen, took a toll on the economy. 

But there may be sunshine ahead. A government stimulus package should soon make a difference, and the lifting of covid-related travel curbs is expected to bring back tourists. It remains to be seen, however, if that will be enough to offset other problems, including tumbling real wages and depressed business confidence. Even if domestic demand recovers, Japan’s economy will be hurt by a [global recession](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/why-a-global-recession-is-inevitable-in-2023).

## Harry and Meghan take on the firm, again

Life in Britain’s royal family is a “dirty game”, says Prince Harry. But it seems that he and his wife, Meghan Markle, cannot help but play it. More accusations were aired on Thursday with the release of “Harry &amp; Meghan”, a Netflix documentary series.

In the six-episode series, the couple raise the stakes of their [public-relations war](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2021/03/08/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-take-on-the-firm) with Britain’s royal family, accusing the palace of leaking and planting stories in the media. They also allege that the firm mistreated Ms Markle because of her race. The trailer had already caused a furore, with some alleging that it portrays the couple as being more harangued by the paparazzi than they actually were.

Still, the couple hope to win hearts and minds. That quest will be helped by a recent controversy about Prince William’s godmother, who resigned from royal duties after news that she had repeatedly asked a black British guest where she was “really” from.
