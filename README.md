<strong>Russia’s </strong>ministry of defence said its forces had captured <strong>Soledar</strong> after months of hurling regular troops and mercenaries at the eastern Ukrainian town. Ukraine’s spokesperson for its troops in the east, however, said that [fighting continued](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2023/01/11/the-west-should-supply-tanks-to-ukraine) and accused Russia of “dispersing information noise”. A Russian success would mark the country’s first victory in half a year and pave the way to cut off the [nearby city of Bakhmut](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/12/06/russia-is-hurling-troops-at-the-tiny-ukrainian-town-of-bakhmut).

<strong>America’s</strong> treasury secretary warned that the government will be unable to service its <strong>debt</strong> by June unless Congress raises the statutory <strong>borrowing limit</strong>. Janet Yellen said that, starting on Thursday, the government will have to start repurposing funds to pay its bills. Raising the [debt ceiling](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2021/09/25/americas-debt-ceiling-is-a-disaster-though-fiscal-rules-can-help) from $31.4trn is needed to avoid a sovereign default. With Republican fiscal hawks [newly empowered in Congress](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2023/01/09/what-is-the-house-freedom-caucus), brinkmanship awaits.

<strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>, America’s largest bank by assets, reported that profit in the fourth quarter of 2022 grew by 6% year on year, to $11bn. That [owed much to higher interest rates](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/07/18/how-american-banks-are-responding-to-rising-interest-rates) and an increase of 48% in net interest income (the gap between lending revenues and borrowing costs). But the bank set aside $1.4bn in anticipation of credit losses and predicted a “mild recession” ahead.

The Biden administration will seek congressional approval to sell <strong>F-16 fighter jets</strong> to <strong>Turkey</strong>, according to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. The $20bn sale, of 40 aircraft, will be conditional on Turkey ratifying [Sweden and Finland’s bids](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/06/28/turkey-lifts-its-block-on-letting-sweden-and-finland-join-nato) to join NATO. Turkey recently put its Russian-made S-400 missile system in storage; in 2019 America had [cancelled a separate aircraft sale](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2019/07/26/turkeys-row-with-america-over-russian-military-hardware) to Turkey in protest over that purchase.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Brazil’s</strong> justice minister said the federal police would request that America extradite his predecessor, Anderson Torres, on Monday if Mr Torres fails to turn himself in. Mr Torres was in charge of public security during the [Brasília riots](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2023/01/12/a-copycat-insurrection-in-brazil-and-its-troubling-aftermath) on January 8th, though he was in Florida at the time and remains there. He has been stripped of that job; there is an order out for his arrest.

A New York City judge has fined [two companies](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/12/07/two-trump-organisation-companies-are-found-guilty-of-tax-fraud) belonging to <strong>Donald Trump </strong>a total of $1.6m for committing 17 felonies, including tax fraud. The businesses were convicted last month of paying their top executives with untaxed perks such as apartments and Mercedes-Benz cars. Mr Trump himself was not on trial.

<strong>Britain’s economy</strong> unexpectedly grew by 0.1% from October to November as pubs and restaurants filled up with people watching the World Cup. The figures suggest that Britain could narrowly [avoid recession](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/08/12/what-is-a-recession), defined as two quarters of contracting GDP, at the end of 2022. But strikes continue to weigh down the economy, which is still smaller than it was before the covid-19 pandemic.

## America and Japan buddy up in defence

On Friday Kishida Fumio, Japan’s prime minister, visits the White House. His meeting with Joe Biden bookends a whirlwind tour of countries, including France, Italy, Britain and Canada, as Japan prepares to host a G7 summit in Hiroshima in May. In Washington, climate and trade issues, especially American curbs on semiconductor exports to China, will be on the agenda. But the two leaders will also focus on [security](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/09/15/war-in-ukraine-has-bolstered-japans-support-for-a-stronger-army). On Wednesday their governments announced a commitment to strengthen their bilateral security alliance, faced with an increasingly assertive China. 

This move comes at a time of upheaval for Japan’s security policy. Under a plan released in December, the country will nearly double its defence spending and acquire new weapons systems, including long-range missiles. The Biden administration has praised the initiative, seeing Japan’s build-up as essential to deterring Chinese aggression. And thus a means to ensure the [security of the Indo-Pacific](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2023/01/04/reinventing-the-indo-pacific).

## The calm before the storm for America’s banks

On the surface, the ripples look calm enough. Four of America’s biggest lenders—Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo—report fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on Friday. The expectation is that they, along with [Goldman Sachs](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/10/18/goldman-sachss-disastrous-main-street-gamble) and Morgan Stanley who report next week, will make a similar level of profit as they did in the second or third quarters of 2022.

Yet those gentle undulations hide a frantic churn in bank-business revenues. Net interest income—the money banks collect on loans, less the money they pay out on deposits—is soaring as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Meanwhile, the risk of a slowing economy may force borrowers to default, so banks are setting aside loan-loss provisions. The shock of much higher interest rates has killed off dealmaking activity, while leading to banner years for trading desks. These pressures are expected to balance out for now. But choppier waters may lie ahead.

## Germany’s economy slightly rebounds

On Friday Germany’s statistics agency announced that the country’s economy expanded by 1.9% in 2022. This was more than analysts expected, but slower than the increase of 2.6% recorded last year, one of the most difficult for the German economy in recent history. Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine radically reduced Russian deliveries of natural gas to Germany; in 2021 Russia accounted for over half of German gas imports. A rapid increase in energy prices, as well as post-pandemic challenges like supply-chain bottlenecks, posed a serious threat to Germany’s manufacturing-heavy economic model.

Yet so far the economy has weathered the storm thanks to the government’s fiscal support and milder weather that has kept energy prices down. Even so, in early 2023 Germany is expected to slip into recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth. But it is expected to be mild, as is the downturn in the rest of the euro zone.

## How to change Indian palates

For Hindus, the middle of January is an auspicious time. Makar Sankranti, a festival that marks the end of the winter solstice—known as “Pongal” in south India—falls this weekend. For millions of Indian farmers it is an occasion to celebrate harvests past while praying for more bountiful ones to come. 

Rice and wheat are India’s traditional staples. But [India’s government](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/02/05/indias-government-and-its-greens-disagree-on-what-counts-as-forest) is hoping to change that. It pushed the UN to declare 2023 the International Year of Millets. At home, it is organising events to increase consumption and production of cereals. 

Their reasoning is sound. Millets, a name given to a range of small-grained cereals, require far less water than rice and wheat. They also provide more protein and fibre. Yet they remain largely unfashionable with the Indian population. Per-person consumption of millets has fallen in recent decades, as urbanisation changed consumer tastes. The government may struggle to convert Indian palates.

## A new film tackles race and gender in France

“Saint Omer”, France’s entry for this year’s Oscars, is released in America on Friday. To describe it simply as a courtroom drama is to overlook the subtle study of motherhood, race, separation and belonging at the centre of this first feature film by Alice Diop, a French director born to Senegalese parents in the suburbs of Paris. 

The movie follows the trial of Laurence Coly (Guslagie Malanda), a Senegalese woman studying in Paris. She admits to leaving her baby daughter on a beach in northern France to be carried away by the tide and is accused of murder. The story unfolds through the eyes of Rama (Kayije Kagame), a writer whose parents also come from Senegal. The trial awakens in Rama the pain of her own maternal relationship as well as her bi-cultural anxiety, peeling back layers of racial and cultural prejudice. 

Ms Diop has already won gongs at the [Venice Film Festival](https://te.arielherself.xyz/prospero/2017/09/05/why-it-is-significant-that-venice-film-festival-put-vr-on-the-bill) for “Saint Omer”, which is based on a true story. It is an artful account of the immigrant experience in France. And of motherhood everywhere.
