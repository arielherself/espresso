## <p align="center">Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter</p>

Thousands of people in Shanghai staged a demonstration against <strong>China’s</strong> draconian anti-covid measures; some reportedly called for the removal of President Xi Jinping. Sporadic anti-lockdown protests also broke out in Beijing, the capital. A fire that killed ten people in Urumqi, the capital of the western province of Xinjiang, has focused people’s anger. Demonstrators there blamed covid [restrictions](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/11/24/chinas-response-to-a-surge-in-covid-19-cases-is-muddled) for slowing the response of emergency services. 

Heavy snowfall is forecast to begin on Sunday in and around <strong>Kyiv</strong>, Ukraine’s capital, where millions of people still have only limited access to electricity, water and heat. Below-freezing temperatures are expected for several days. Russian missile strikes have damaged energy infrastructure in much of the country, causing widespread [blackouts](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/23/in-ukraine-living-as-normal-is-an-act-of-defiance). Volodymyr Zelensky, the president, asked <strong>Ukrainians</strong> to “save power and consume it rationally”. 

Supporters of <strong>Imran Khan</strong>, Pakistan’s ousted president, rallied in Rawalpindi, on the outskirts of the capital, Islamabad. It was Mr Khan’s first show of strength since he survived an [assassination attempt](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/11/03/imran-khan-pakistans-ex-prime-minister-survives-an-attempt-on-his-life) earlier this month. The former cricket star called off a planned march into Islamabad, for fear of causing havoc, he said.

<strong>Tsai Ing-wen</strong>, the [president of Taiwan](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2020/01/02/taiwans-china-sceptic-president-tsai-ing-wen-may-win-again), resigned as head of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party after a dismal set of results for her party in local elections. Ms Tsai had tried to frame the elections as a way for voters to rebuke Chinese aggression. Taiwan’s opposition party, the Kuomintang, had focused on the government’s handling of covid-19. Ms Tsai will remain as president until Taiwan holds elections in 2024.

America’s government gave <strong>Chevron</strong> a licence to produce crude oil in <strong>Venezuela</strong>, three years after imposing sanctions that forbade the energy giant from operating in the country. The deal follows talks between [Venezuela’s president](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/08/18/venezuelas-dictator-is-less-isolated-than-he-once-was), Nicolás Maduro, and opposition groups which are designed to unfreeze some of the autocratic state’s overseas assets.

Yoweri Museveni, <strong>Uganda’s</strong> president, extended the quarantine of two districts in Central Uganda to try and stop the spread of <strong>Ebola</strong>. Mubende and Kassanda are regarded as the epicentre of an outbreak of the disease that was declared on September 20th—they will now remain locked down until December 17th. The strain of Ebola circulating in Uganda is rare and has no proven [vaccine](https://te.arielherself.xyz/science-and-technology/2015/08/08/cluster-bombing). 

<strong>Football World Cup: </strong>On Sunday Germany face a fearsome <strong>Spanish </strong>side which already walloped Costa Rica 7-0. Having lost to <strong>Japan </strong>in their first game, <strong>Germany </strong>are desperate to beat Spain. The team has a recent record of flopping out early in [major tournaments](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/11/18/some-of-footballs-greatest-players-never-appeared-in-a-world-cup). Meanwhile on Saturday <strong>France </strong>became the first nation to qualify for the round of 16, after beating <strong>Denmark</strong>.

<strong>Word of the Week: </strong><em>Iskra, </em>meaning “spark”, the name of the paper Vladimir Lenin once edited from London. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/22/how-offshore-journalists-challenge-vladimir-putins-empire-of-lies).

## Russian fertiliser sets sail for Africa

Many poor countries rely on Russian [fertiliser](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/05/31/why-fertiliser-prices-are-soaring) to boost their harvests. But more than 400,000 tonnes of the stuff are currently stuck in European warehouses. Although fertilisers are exempt from sanctions, banks and insurance companies are wary of backing trade in Russian goods, lest they accidently get slapped with fines or criminal charges. 

That is a pain for Russia, which was enticed to back a deal to allow grain to leave Ukraine’s Black Sea ports with promises of help for its fertiliser trade. Russian companies have offered to donate stocks to African countries but have struggled to pay for the freight. So the UN has stepped in. This weekend a ship chartered by its World Food Programme is en route from the Netherlands to Malawi, bearing 20,000 tonnes of Russian fertiliser. It is in everyone’s interests to shovel fertiliser along again.

## A call of duty for American regulators

America’s Federal Trade Commission is preparing to decide whether to oppose Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, a video-game developer that the software firm agreed to [buy for $69bn](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/why-microsoft-is-splashing-69bn-on-video-games/21807242) in January. [Microsoft](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2021/04/15/the-method-in-microsofts-merger-madness), which makes the Xbox console, would get Activision’s library of games, including “Candy Crush”, a mobile hit, and the murderously popular “Call of Duty” franchise. [Sony](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/02/04/how-sony-can-make-a-comeback-in-the-console-wars), in particular, worries that Microsoft might take Activision titles away from its rival PlayStation console.

Microsoft has promised to keep “Call of Duty” on the PlayStation for a decade. It has pointed out to the FTC, and 15 other competition watchdogs examining the deal, that its Xbox lags behind both Nintendo and Sony in the console market, and that it has little presence in mobile. But trustbusters, who in recent years have placed big tech in their sights, worry about Microsoft’s leading position in subscription and [cloud-based gaming](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2019/06/15/video-gaming-enters-the-cloud). Those are tiny industries for now, but regulators are in a trigger-happy mood.

## The World Cup of Tennis fights for relevance

Tennis may be the world’s most popular individual sport, but it also has a rich history of team competitions. The Davis Cup, a tournament for national men’s teams launched in 1900, claims to be the world’s longest-running international team sports event. But it is struggling for relevance. Senior players and fans prefer the four [grand slams](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/07/08/tennis-is-becoming-a-more-homogeneous-game), the sport’s most prestigious, and lucrative, tournaments. 

In 2018 the International Tennis Federation, the sport’s governing body, entered a 25-year partnership worth $3bn with Kosmos, an investment group, to revamp the Davis Cup. The event was squeezed into just a week in a single city (this year, Malaga in Spain). It was rebranded as the “World Cup of Tennis”. Whether this is attracting new fans is still unclear, though viewing numbers for the final, between Canada and Australia, on Sunday will offer some indication. But competition for eyeballs will be stiff: that same day Canada will face Croatia at the football World Cup in Qatar.

## Wireless earphones double as hearing aids

Hearing loss is the third most common chronic health condition among Americans, yet three-quarters of those affected do not use hearing aids. Many people go without so as not to “feel old”, though the aids can also be expensive and inconvenient to acquire. But research in the journal <em>iScience</em> has shown that ordinary wireless earphones can be used as hearing aids. 

Audiologists compared Apple’s market-leading AirPods Pro with two professional hearing aids. AirPods’ “Live Listen” tool (popular with birdwatchers and eavesdroppers), which receives and amplifies audio from an iPhone’s microphone, enabled them to function as makeshift hearing aids. In listening tests with hearing-impaired volunteers, AirPods Pro performed as well as a basic hearing aid and almost matched a premium one. This proves that earbuds could act as stopgaps for people awaiting assessment at a fraction of the cost. And for those hung up on “feeling old”, what could be trendier than nicking a near-ubiquitous accessory among teenagers?

## Hervé Renard, manager of the Saudi football team

At the World Cup in Qatar, Saudi [fans](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/17/qatars-neighbours-hope-for-a-world-cup-tourism-boom) are outnumbered only by Americans and those of the hosts. Proximity to Qatar certainly helps, but no one should doubt the Saudis’ passion for the game. Yet their national team had little to show for it on the sport’s biggest stage—until this week. On Tuesday the Green Falcons, as they are known, [shocked](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/23/what-saudi-arabias-football-victory-means-for-the-middle-east) Argentina, among the pre-tournament favourites.

King Salman gave workers the day off in celebration, just one sign of the commitment the country’s rulers have shown to the sport. In 2021 the Saudi Public Investment Fund, chaired by Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, bought Newcastle United, a team in England’s [Premier League](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/08/04/an-unusual-season-for-english-footballs-premier-league). PIF money has also poured into Saudi Arabia’s domestic league, which attracts tens of thousands of spectators. And Saudi officials are plotting an audacious bid to host the World Cup in 2030.

For all that, the Saudis’ most astute decision may prove to be the appointment, in 2019, of Hervé Renard as manager of the national team. Against Argentina, commentators found his tactic of holding a high defensive line naive, but it proved overpowering on the pitch. Mr Renard’s inspirational pep talk at half-time, when Saudi Arabia were trailing, was also instrumental, according to one player.

The victory felt like the culmination of Mr Renard’s own journey. In 1999 he began coaching SC Draguignan, a small team in the south of France, after his unremarkable playing career had been cut short by injury. To make ends meet, he worked as a cleaner between training sessions, something he later described as the “best schooling” he ever had. Other coaching stints, in Asia and [Africa](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/24/how-do-budding-african-footballers-make-it-to-the-top), followed. In 2012 he led unfancied Zambia to their first African Cup of Nations win. Three years later he took the trophy again, this time with Ivory Coast. 

Mr Renard’s decision to take the Saudi job earned him plenty of criticism, given the country’s poor human-rights record. He insists such matters have “improved a lot,” and that he accepted the role for sporting reasons, not the significant money on offer. On Saturday his team lost to Poland. But the Saudis may yet secure a first appearance in the World Cup’s knockout stages since 1994 with a win against Mexico on November 30th. Should they pull it off, that would strengthen Mr Renard’s claim that Saudi Arabia truly is a “country of football”.
