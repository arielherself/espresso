The 20th <strong>Communist Party congress </strong>opened in Beijing, with Xi Jinping pledging to “reunify” China by bringing Taiwan under the mainland’s control. He said China would “take all necessary measures” to quell “separatist movements”, by force if necessary. Mr Xi also defended his increasingly painful zero-covid policy, calling measures to contain the virus an “all-out people’s war”. Despite a convention that Communist Party leaders serve a maximum of two five-year terms, [the congress](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/10/13/the-communist-party-congress-will-highlight-xi-jinpings-power) is expected to bestow Mr Xi a third.

Britain’s new chancellor of the exchequer, <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong>, said that the government’s growth push had gone “too far, too fast”. In a further attempt to calm jittery bond markets, [Kwasi Kwarteng](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/14/kwasi-kwartengs-tenure-as-britains-chancellor-wasnt-the-shortest)’s replacement said that he would raise taxes and cut public spending. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the <strong>Bank of England</strong>, said that interest rates would have to rise further than expected in light of high inflation.

<strong>Ukraine’s </strong>prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said the country has “maintained energy stability” amid fears of <strong>blackouts</strong> sparked by [Russian strikes](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/13/russias-terror-strikes-fail-to-do-much-damage-to-ukraine). Mr Shmyhal said that in the first three days of last week Russia had launched 130 missiles and drones targeting key infrastructure to “intimidate” civilians and “paralyse” the energy industry. Ukrainians had cut their electricity consumption by one-tenth to avoid outages, he added.

A fire at Evin prison, a facility used to lock up many of <strong>Iran’s</strong> dissidents, killed at least four people and injured 61, according to state media. The fire followed a clash between security forces and inmates—including some arrested during [ongoing nationwide protests](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/12/despite-lethal-repression-irans-protests-continue), which erupted after the death of a 22-year-old woman detained by the morality police for showing too much hair.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Tunisia</strong> struck a preliminary agreement with the IMF, committing to reforms in exchange for a $1.9bn loan. The indebted [North African economy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/15/from-tea-to-cars-egypt-and-tunisia-struggle-to-pay-for-imports) lacks food and fuel, and has been wracked by protests. But the government has dragged its feet on cuts to subsidies and public-sector wages. If the IMF’s board ratifies the deal, it could pave the way for other donors.

A pair of gunmen killed at least 11 people at a military training ground in south-western <strong>Russia</strong>. Fifteen others were wounded. Officials called it a “terrorist attack”. The perpetrators, who were both shot dead, were nationals of an unnamed former Soviet nation. The incident highlights growing anger at Vladimir Putin’s mobilisation of Russians for his [war in Ukraine](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/13/russias-terror-strikes-fail-to-do-much-damage-to-ukraine).

<strong>Uganda</strong> imposed a three-week lockdown in two districts of its central region to contain breakouts of <strong>Ebola</strong>. Movement in and out of Mubende and Kassanda will be restricted, and dusk-till-dawn curfews have been imposed. Since Uganda’s first [recorded death](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2020/05/01/covid-19-has-become-one-of-the-biggest-killers-of-2020) almost a month ago, the hemorrhagic fever, for which there is no cure, has infected 58 people and killed 19.

## Weekend Profile: Mohammed Rostami Gachi, Iran’s brutal enforcer

It was his rapid promotion that surprised many. Just a few months into his post as the police chief of Talesh, an Iranian provincial backwater, Mohammed Rostami Gachi was promoted to head the Islamic Republic’s [morality police](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/26/who-are-irans-hated-morality-police) 400km away in the capital, Tehran. Previous Iranian governments had never thought much of him. But the incoming administration of Ebrahim Raisi in 2021 admired Mr Gachi’s hardline beliefs. Shortly after taking the job he declared his intention to enforce the mandatory veil for women, which had fallen loose under the pragmatist presidency of Hassan Rouhani. “Those who stubbornly remove the <em>hijab </em>are criminals,” Mr Gachi told Iran’s press.

Over the following months, he reactivated the morality police. Their men in dark green uniforms and women in black <em>chadors</em> scoured the streets hunting for infringements of [sharia](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2021/09/08/what-is-sharia-law). They broke up bands jamming in cafes. They hauled girls caught for “bad” <em>hijabs</em> away in their windowless vans and took them to facilities for “re-education”. Sometimes they [gave them a beating](https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2022/09/28/im-the-same-as-mahsa-and-i-want-my-freedom-anger-at-irans-regime-spills-onto-the-streets). And then, on September 13th, Mr Gachi’s men carted away 22-year-old Mahsa Amini to her [death](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/22/why-iranian-women-are-burning-their-hijabs) three days later for improperly wearing the veil.

The [popular](https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2022/10/12/are-they-watching-our-homes-are-they-in-our-phones-a-diary-of-fear-in-tehran) protests that this sparked had, in truth, been [some time in the making](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/12/despite-lethal-repression-irans-protests-continue). Under Mr Rouhani, Iran breathed more easily with an unwritten contract: leave the clerics to wield power and let society live as it wants. The Islamic republic shrank into an Islamic government. Mr Raisi’s determination to turn the clock back and apply sharia to an ever-more secular population tipped resentment into civil disobedience. Even before Ms Amini was killed, female students were spilling out of their segregated campus canteens into male ones. Women on buses and the metro disregarded even their token nod to a head covering. 

The mullahs’ crackdown might have been easier to digest had they practised the moral strictures they preached. But while people’s incomes declined, mullahs’ sons ostentatiously combed Tehran’s highways in their Ferraris. And some questioned Mr Gachi’s standards of enforcement when it came to his own. His brother accumulated businesses in their hometown of Kermanshah. 

As protests against Ms Amini’s death spread—costing, so far, more than 200 lives—Mr Gachi’s patrols disappeared from the streets. Western governments have imposed sanctions against him and his morality police for “spreading a culture of violence and excessive force”. For Mr Gachi, they were just spreading Islam.

## Global hunger on the rise

On Sunday millions of people around the world gather at marches, marathons and concerts to observe the UN’s World Food Day. But the mood is sour. [Global grain prices](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/05/19/the-coming-food-catastrophe), which fell over the summer, have climbed back to where they were soon after Russia invaded Ukraine. A stronger dollar, and weak economic growth, have squeezed household and government budgets. The World Food Programme reckons a record 345m people are facing acute [food insecurity](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/03/09/progress-to-eradicate-global-hunger-is-stalling), up from 193m in 2021.

A longer-term difficulty is that food supply may fall far short of demand. The bumper crop—including Russia’s record wheat harvest—that stopped this year from becoming a catastrophe, is unlikely to be repeated. Farmers skimping on expensive fertilisers may also dampen yields. A UN-brokered deal under which Russia has allowed grain exports from Ukrainian ports expires in November, and its extension is uncertain. The seeds of disaster are being sown.

## Putin sparks new energy into CND

The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, a British lobby group, was formed in the early years of the cold war. Its emblem has become a visual byword for peace. The CND’s membership peaked at 110,000, in 1985, and has since fallen to around 30,000. But Kate Hudson, its general secretary, says its ranks are now growing again as [Vladimir Putin’s war](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/06/02/a-new-nuclear-era) makes a new generation concerned about [nuclear threats](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/09/29/could-the-war-in-ukraine-go-nuclear).

On Sunday the CND will march on Menwith Hill, a British and American intelligence base in Yorkshire. Such gatherings are a staple of the movement. In the 1980s campaigners fought to remove American cruise missiles from RAF Greenham Common in Berkshire. Now the CND is protesting against the return of NATO nukes to an American base at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk. Members believe that the risk of [nuclear war](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2015/03/07/the-unkicked-addiction) is higher than it has ever been.

## LeBron James’s ultimate slam dunk

When [Kareem Abdul-Jabbar](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2017/12/19/kareem-abdul-jabbar-a-brooding-sportsman-sage) retired from the NBA in 1989, he held the record for the highest number of points scored in a career. Mr Abdul-Jabbar racked up 38,387 points across 20 seasons, 14 of them at the Los Angeles Lakers. But, barring injury or an inexplicable drop in form, his record will soon be broken. As of Sunday, the start of the 2022-23 season, [LeBron James](https://te.arielherself.xyz/game-theory/2016/06/20/wait-your-turn-steph-lebron-james-proves-he-is-still-the-king), who also plays for the Lakers, is only 1,325 points behind.

Todd Whitehead of Synergy Sports, a basketball analytics company, has calculated the cumulative chance of Mr James breaking Mr Abdul-Jabbar’s record in each regular-season match, based on his participation and scoring rates over the past three seasons. His percentage chances reach double digits on February 23rd, when the Lakers host the Golden State Warriors. His odds then rise quickly: to 35% against the Minnesota Timberwolves on March 3rd, and to 50% against the Memphis Grizzlies four days later. By the end of the season in April, it’s virtually a slam dunk. Arise, King James.

## A showcase of Xi Jinping’s power

The five-yearly congress of China’s Communist Party opened today. Not since the time of Mao Zedong has a congress been so clearly aimed at emphasising the [power of a single leader](https://te.arielherself.xyz/special-report/2022/10/10/china-wants-to-change-or-break-a-world-order-set-by-others). The week-long session, [meticulously stage-managed](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/10/13/an-obsession-with-control-is-making-china-weaker-but-more-dangerous), will make the case that only [Xi Jinping](https://te.arielherself.xyz/theprincepod) can lead China towards its goal of “great rejuvenation”.

Mr Xi kicked things off with a two-hour speech. He portrayed his “[zero-covid policy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/10/13/china-shows-few-signs-of-loosening-its-zero-covid-policy)” as an achievement, a signal that draconian restrictions would continue, even as the [economy sputters](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/08/18/chinas-economy-is-beset-by-problems). He reiterated his desire for peaceful unification with [Taiwan](https://te.arielherself.xyz/special-report/2022/10/10/china-has-chilling-plans-for-governing-taiwan), but did not rule out the use of force. “The helmsman”, as Mr Xi is sometimes called, warned of “high winds, choppy waters and even dangerous storms” ahead.

By convention Mr Xi, having served two five-year terms, should retire. But there is no doubt he will remain party chief when the new Politburo is revealed on the day after the congress. And don’t expect to see an obvious successor in the mix.
