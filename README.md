The Republican Party narrowly regained control of America’s <strong>House of Representatives</strong>. Eight days after the [midterm elections](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/10/after-the-midterms-america-and-its-democracy-look-stronger), the party clinched its 218th (and decisive) seat, to the Democrats’ 210. Regardless of how the remaining seven races fall, their margin is far slimmer than they had hoped for—and the worst midterm performance by a party out of power in 20 years. Nevertheless, it will allow them to stall much of President Joe Biden’s agenda.

<strong>Mitch McConnell</strong> was re-elected leader of the Republicans in America’s Democrat-controlled <strong>Senate</strong>. He beat Rick Scott, who was backed by Donald Trump. It was the first challenge that Mr McConnell, who has led his party in the Senate since 2007, has faced, marking the latest instance of [Republican infighting](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/11/10/a-republican-victory-will-be-much-smaller-than-democrats-feared).

The UN secretary general, António Guterres, confirmed that an agreement to allow <strong>Ukraine</strong> to export <strong>grain</strong> by sea, despite an ongoing Russian blockade, would be extended by 120 days. Mr Guterres also said that work was being done to allow Russia to export food and fertiliser. On October 29th Russia announced that it was [abandoning the deal](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/30/putin-suspends-a-deal-to-allow-grain-exports-from-ukraine).

<strong>Myanmar’s </strong>state media said that the ruling junta released almost 6,000 of the more than 16,000 people it has arrested since seizing power in a coup in February 2021. Among the freed are a former British diplomat and three other foreign nationals. Despite the show of grace, the regime’s war against pro-democracy fighters and ethnic militias [continues](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/14/where-might-conflict-flare-up-in-2023), while the [economy lies in ruins](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/09/15/an-economically-illiterate-junta-is-running-myanmar-into-the-ground).

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Elon Musk</strong> promised to reduce his time at <strong>Twitter </strong>and eventually install a new boss at the social network. Shares in Tesla, Mr Musk’s electric-vehicle firm, have recently slipped amid investors’ unease over the time he is [devoting to Twitter](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/11/07/elon-musks-challenge-to-management-thinking), which he acquired for $44bn last month. Earlier Mr Musk sent an ultimatum to Twitter’s employees: commit to a new “hardcore” working environment or leave.

<strong>Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</strong>, Brazil’s [incoming president](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/11/03/lulas-foreign-policy-ambitions-will-be-tempered-by-circumstances), was greeted enthusiastically at <strong>COP27</strong>, the UN climate summit in Egypt. Lula told delegates that “Brazil is back” and promised to fight deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. Germany and Norway have signalled that they are willing to help revive the “Amazon Fund”, a coalition working to protect the area.

<strong>Xi Jinping</strong> dressed down Canada’s prime minister, <strong>Justin Trudeau</strong>, in a <em>sotto voce</em> exchange at the G20 summit in Bali. China’s president said it was “not appropriate” that details of their recent dialogue, during which Canada accused China of interfering with its elections and other domestic affairs, were leaked. An uncomfortable Mr Trudeau explained that Canada believes “in free and open and frank dialogue”.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 1.6bn, the number of international tourist trips forecast to take place in 2023, still fewer than in 2019. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/14/ten-trends-to-watch-in-the-coming-year).

## Britain’s autumn budget

On Thursday Britain’s latest chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, will deliver his first [autumn statement](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/10/the-best-ways-to-fix-britains-budget). Designed to reassure investors, its contents will make voters squeal. 

The backdrop is Britain’s deteriorating economic outlook, rising interest rates and a sharp increase in the bill to service the government’s debt. To achieve [forecasts](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/11/10/the-obr-will-be-the-arbiter-of-britains-autumn-budget) that by 2027-28 the debt-to-GDP ratio will be falling, the government is expected to announce spending cuts and tax rises worth nearly £55bn ($65.4bn) annually, or around 2.5% of GDP

Much of the total will come from squeezing spending on public services. That is unwelcome news for those already concerned about [cracks](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/11/10/the-night-watchman-welfare-state) in health services and elsewhere. Current budgets are being eaten away by rising costs. [Strikes](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/11/03/britain-faces-a-wave-of-industrial-action-this-winter) over wages are looming, too. Household finances are already [stretched.](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/11/03/britains-next-recession-may-have-already-begun) Two months ago Mr Hunt’s predecessor recklessly promised tax cuts. Now tax increases are on the cards, though they may only happen slowly as thresholds are frozen. Mr Hunt will argue that his fiscal medicine is necessary. But it will not go down easily.

## A new leader for America’s Catholics

On Thursday American bishops meet in Baltimore as the plenary assembly of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops wraps up. Earlier this week the bishops elected Timothy Broglio, the archbishop for the armed forces, as their national president. He will be an important voice for the church, notably in the battle over [abortion](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/11/11/where-abortion-was-on-the-ballot-americans-voted-to-protect-it) in America.

Archbishop Broglio was not the most ardent pro-life campaigner on the ballot. But the bishops’ hard line on abortion is unlikely to change under his leadership. He supported a religious exemption for covid-19 vaccines, on the grounds that some jabs were developed using cells derived from aborted foetal tissue. His new deputy, Archbishop William Lori, has chaired the conference’s committee on pro-life activities.

The conference is out of step with many American Catholics. According to Pew Research Centre, a think-tank, more than half believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. 

## Burberry’s buoyant six months

Though high-street clothing retailers have struggled in 2022, it has been a good year to [tailor the rich](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/06/fashion-gets-a-modern-makeover). With their customers less at the mercy of inflation, many luxury fashion brands have enjoyed bumper profits. On Thursday Burberry, a classic British brand, reported a strong £1.3bn ($1.6bn) in sales for the first half of their financial year, with profit higher than the same period in 2019, before the pandemic.

On the same day Burberry’s chief executive, Jonathan Akeroyd, unveiled his plan to compete with European rivals, by increasing sales of accessories. He is also emphasising the brand’s Britishness—previously he replaced former creative director Riccardo Tisci, an Italian, with Daniel Lee, a Yorkshireman.

The brand’s future, however, lies closer to Beijing than Bradford. Burberry made £1.3bn last year from Asia, almost half its total. But sales in China, its biggest Asian market, have been hurt by the country’s zero-covid policy. Some analysts predict that China’s luxury market will recover in 2023; Mr Akeroyd will be hoping they are right.

## Indonesia’s economy is ready to boom

Like much of the world, Indonesia is battling inflation. In October prices rose by 5.7% year on year, well above the Bank Indonesia’s target of 2-4%. So on Thursday policymakers increased interest rates for the fourth consecutive month, by half a percentage point to 5.25%. Indonesia’s [economic prospects](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/11/14/indonesia-is-poised-for-a-boom-politics-permitting), however, are bright.  
  
 The economy grew at an annual rate of 5.7% in real terms in the quarter ending in September, the fastest pace in over a year. Foreign investment has poured into the country’s metals-processing sector, which draws on abundant deposits of nickel and other metals. Exports are booming as demand for other natural resources, such as [palm oil](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/04/02/indonesia-the-worlds-biggest-producer-has-a-palm-oil-crisis), has risen. 

Joko Widodo, Indonesia’s president, has managed the economy well, keeping government debt low and reintroducing a deficit cap. But that also presents a challenge. Jokowi, as he is known, must step down at the end of his second term, in 2024. His successor may not guide the economy as well as he has.

## The Latin Grammy Awards

It has been a bumper year for [Latin music](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2017/09/21/streaming-has-pushed-latin-music-into-the-mainstream). In March Anitta became the first Brazilian singer to top [Spotify’s global song chart](https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/graphic-detail/2022/01/29/what-spotify-data-show-about-the-decline-of-english). Bad Bunny, a Puerto Rican who was the most-streamed artist on Spotify in 2020 and 2021, has smashed records again in 2022. When his album “Un Verano Sin Ti” (“A Summer Without You”) was released on May 6th, Bad Bunny became then the most-streamed artist on a single day ever. 

On Thursday, at the Latin Grammy Awards in Las Vegas, the acts will probably win industry plaudits, too. Bad Bunny leads with ten nominations; Anitta’s hit single “Envolver” (“Involved”) is up for record of the year. Others with a good chance of success include Camilo, a Colombian singer-songwriter; and Edgar Barrera, a Mexican musician. Latin music is also gaining more recognition at international awards shows: “Un Verano” is shortlisted for album of the year at America’s Grammys in February 2023, a first for a Spanish-language record.
