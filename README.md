 **America’s** president, Joe Biden, said his country would [not cede the Middle East](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/07/12/what-does-the-middle-east-offer-america) to China or Russia, during a summit in the Saudi city of Jeddah. “The United States is not going anywhere,” he told the heads of nine Arab states. Yet Mr Biden failed to secure a commitment from **Saudi Arabia** to increase energy output in coming weeks to tamp down rising prices. The summit also dashed American hopes for a regional security axis, that would include Israel, to counter Iranian threats.

 **Wildfires** tore through southwestern Europe and north Africa as temperature soared above 45℃ in several places. In the French department of Gironde about 14,000 people have been forced to leave their homes and 1,200 firefighters are battling the flames. More than 3,000 people have also been evacuated from their homes in Spain’s province of Malaga, a popular holiday destination. [Temperatures are expected to rise further still](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/04/16/in-chilly-parts-of-europe-heatwaves-strengthen-environmentalism) over the next few days; Britain has issued its first-ever “extreme heat” warning.

 **Iran** has imposed sanctions on 61 Americans, accusing them of backing an exiled dissent group that wants to end the country’s clerical regime. The latest blacklist includes officials who served under President Donald Trump, including secretary of state Mike Pompeo, attorney Rudy Giuliani and former White House national security adviser John Bolton. While the sanctions are mostly symbolic—they allow authorities to seize any Iran-based assets owned by the 61—they come as America’s efforts [to revive the 2015 nuclear pact](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/nuclear-talks-with-iran-enter-the-endgame/21807592) falter.

 **Russia** ’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, ordered units to ramp up attacks in order to pre-empt Ukrainian [strikes on occupied areas](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/06/30/does-a-protracted-conflict-favour-russia-or-ukraine). **Ukraine** accused Russia of terrorising civilians by firing long-range missiles at crowded residential blocks, [industrial plants](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/14/the-war-is-forcing-ukraines-energy-planners-to-be-creative), schools and shops. Russia said the target of its cruise-missile strike on Vinnytsia on Thursday was a meeting between officials and foreign arms suppliers.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

Mexico said it had arrested **Rafael Caro Quintero** , a founding member of the powerful Guadalajara Cartel, during a military operation in the north-western state of Sinaloa. The drugs lord is on [America’s most-wanted list](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2013/08/17/ghosts-of-the-past) for the kidnapping and murder of an American anti-narcotics agent in 1985. Officials said they would seek the fugitive’s immediate extradition.

 **Sri Lanka** ’s parliament convened to begin the process of electing a new president to replace Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was ousted after [mass protests](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/09/sri-lankas-president-resigns-in-the-face-of-massive-protests) and this week [fled to Singapore](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/13/sri-lankas-president-flees-leaving-the-country-in-chaos) from where he submitted his resignation letter. On Tuesday it will accept nominations for his successor. The acting president, Ranil Wickremesinghe, wants the job, as does the leader of the opposition, Sajith Premadasa.

A televised debate between the five candidates to [succeed Boris Johnson](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/07/12/the-conservative-party-after-boris-johnson) as leader of the Conservative Party and **Britain’s prime minister** entailed tetchy squabbles over how to finance public spending, and the rivals’ credentials. **Rishi Sunak** , who won the first two rounds of voting, was criticised for raising taxes when he was [chancellor of the exchequer](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/03/19/does-rishi-sunak-have-the-stomach-for-what-he-must-swallow), as was **Penny Mordaunt** , the [bookmakers’ favourite](https://www.economist.com/interactive/2022/07/12/the-race-to-become-britains-next-pm), for her record as equalities minister.

## Sunday night Tory-vision

The five remaining [contenders](https://www.economist.com/interactive/2022/07/12/the-race-to-become-britains-next-pm) vying to [succeed Boris Johnson](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/07/12/the-conservative-party-after-boris-johnson) as leader of Britain’s Conservative Party—and with it, prime minister of the country—will face each other in a televised debate on Sunday evening. The contenders are [Liz Truss](https://www.economist.com/britain/2021/04/08/liz-truss-and-the-power-of-perkiness), the foreign secretary; [Rishi Sunak](https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/11/26/rishi-sunak-thatcherite-at-heart), a former chancellor; [Tom Tugendhat](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2022/07/13/tom-tugendhat-on-his-ten-year-plan-for-britains-growth), the chairman of the foreign affairs committee; [Penny Mordaunt](https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/05/09/penny-mordaunt-is-on-manoeuvres), a trade minister; and [Kemi Badenoch](https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/10/03/the-tories-launch-a-culture-war), a former local-government minister. The first debate was held on Friday, and the last one will take place on Tuesday.

The candidates should expect to be grilled on Britain’s battle with inflation, the war in Ukraine and how they can restore trust to British politics after Mr Johnson’s scandal-hit tenure. Although all Britons can tune in to see their future leader, most will be [powerless to vote](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/07/14/britains-prime-minister-becomes-a-rotten-presidency). That right belongs only to Conservative MPs, who this week will whittle down the contenders to a final two, and then around 180,000 members of the party who will be balloted to choose a winner over summer.

## India’s banks get out of a funk

HDFC Bank, India’s biggest private lender, reports its results for the quarter ending in June on Saturday, opening the country’s banking-sector earnings season. HDFC posted profits of $1.1bn, an increase of 19% over the same period last year. The bank hopes that profits will double over the next five years as it reaps the benefits of [acquiring a housing-finance unit](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/04/09/hdfc-banks-merger-marks-a-milestone-for-india) in April. In the rest of the sector, net profits of the 12 biggest banks are forecast to have grown by 47% year-on-year.

Such bullishness suggests that India’s banks are getting their act together after years of struggling with loans to businesses not being repaid. India’s central bank, which has been clamping down on lax lenders, estimates that bad loans are now 5.9% of the total, a six-year low. And India’s government is reportedly considering culling the number of state-owned banks—which tend to perform especially badly—from 12 to about four.

## Bacteria-produced jet fuel

Aviation requires fuel that is energy-dense—powerful, but also light. Without a sufficiently powerful and affordable synthetic alternative, flying will continue to rely on fossil fuels. But researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, in California, may have [a solution](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/07/13/modified-bacterial-fungicides-may-propel-the-planes-of-the-future). 

In a new paper published in <em>Joule</em>, a journal, the researchers describe how to tweak the enzymes in bacteria to create an artificial metabolic pathway that starts with sugar and ends with polycyclopropanated (POP) fuels. The researchers used the bacteria’s natural metabolism to create cyclopropane rings, one of the most energy-rich structures found in hydrocarbons. Many of the POP fuels had energy densities greater than 40 megajoules per litre, which is more potent than most widely used aviation fuels. 

But to become commercially viable this biofuel must be scaled up in a cost-effective manner. Shifting subsidies from fossil fuels to green ones would be one way to get the product off the ground.

## The rather unpersuasive “Persuasion”

Updating Jane Austen can be a recipe for cinematic magic. “Clueless”, which in 1995 shifted “Emma” to a Beverly Hills high school, is the wittiest Austen adaptation of all. “Persuasion”, released on Netflix on July 15th, is less persuasive. 

The film is set in the early 1800s, and it plods around the usual picturesque locations: Bath, Lyme Regis, various stately homes. But the director, Carrie Cracknell, and the screenwriters, Alice Victoria Winslow and Ron Bass, have modernised Austen’s novel in other ways, perhaps inspired by [“Bridgerton”](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/03/06/in-a-new-breed-of-stories-the-past-is-a-playground-not-a-corset), Netflix’s hit Regency costume drama, or British comedies such as “Bridget Jones’s Diary” and “Fleabag”. The multicultural cast of “Persuasion” is prone to anachronistic dialogue such as “self-care” or “out of his league”. Anne Elliot (Dakota Johnson) swigs wine from a bottle, sobs in the bath and addresses waspish remarks to the camera. But her conspiratorial comments and sly winks make her obnoxiously smug. Her beloved old flame, the tongue-tied Captain Wentworth (Cosmo Jarvis), might have been better off without her.

## Weekend profile: Penny Mordaunt, Britain’s next prime minister?

Penny Mordaunt has emerged as the [bookies’ favourite](https://www.economist.com/interactive/2022/07/12/the-race-to-become-britains-next-pm) to succeed Boris Johnson as leader of the Conservative Party, and thus as Britain’s prime minister. Last week she finished second in the first two ballots of Conservative MPs, who next week will whittle down the five remaining candidates to a final pair. The party’s 100,000-or-so members will then have the final say, with the winner to be announced in early September. If Ms Mordaunt makes it that far, she stands a good chance of triumphing. Separate surveys conducted by ConservativeHome, a grassroots website, and YouGov, a pollster, found that she is the favourite among party members. Yet Ms Mordaunt is unknown outside Westminster. What do the Tories see in her?

Ms Mordaunt was born in 1973. Her mother died when she was 15, and her father, a former paratrooper, fell ill the following year, leaving her to care for her younger brother until her father remarried. She worked as a magician’s assistant to help fund her philosophy studies at the University of Reading. When she joined the leadership race, Ms Mordaunt said her “love and pride” of Britain was kindled as a nine-year-old in Portsmouth, as she watched the navy set sail for [war in the Falklands](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/04/02/the-falklands-war-resonates-40-years-on). Her naval interest seems preordained: she was named after <em>HMS Penelope</em>, a cruiser. She serves as a navy reservist, and was elected as the Conservative MP for Portsmouth North in 2010. 

Ms Mordaunt’s supporters say her rise reflects the party’s appetite for change after the scandal and decadence of Mr Johnson’s tenure. They describe her as hard-working and dutiful, provincial rather than metropolitan. She supported Brexit, but is not fervent about the divorce. In “Greater: Britain After the Storm”, a book she co-authored last year, she offers an affectionate portrait of modern Britain as a good-humoured land of the NHS, pubs and the Human Rights Act. Her policies tend to focus on local communities rather than grand national ideas. One of her ideas is for MPs to be given pots of money to distribute to good causes in their constituencies. She would like to see a bigger role for charities, and for the volunteers who rallied during covid-19 to be put to work permanently.

The video that announced her candidacy was subject to much mockery in Westminster. It featured rolling shots of Britain, set to “I Vow to Thee My Country”, a patriotic ditty. Party members were not so sniffy. Ms Mordaunt’s ideological ambiguity has made her an attractive default candidate for MPs who dislike Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor and current frontrunner, and Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, her main rival for that second place. Yet even her supporters admit she is untested, and that the success of her notional premiership would depend on whether she would be prepared to appoint strong rivals to big posts, or rely on yes-men—as Mr Johnson did.
