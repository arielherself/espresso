The **European Commission** said it does not expect Russia’s Gazprom to restart gas supplies through the **Nord Stream 1** pipeline as scheduled on Thursday. The pipeline was closed last week for maintenance, though some suspect Russia is wielding it as a [political tool](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter) in retaliation for EU sanctions. Gazprom earlier declared <em>force majeure</em> to European buyers, warning that it could not fulfil its supply obligations.

 **China’s** government warned it would take “forceful measures” if **Nancy Pelosi** , speaker of America’s House of Representatives, visits **Taiwan** . The <em>Financial Times</em> reported that Ms Pelosi plans to visit the island, which China claims, next month. Ms Pelosi would be the most senior American lawmaker to visit Taiwan since Newt Gingrich travelled to the island as speaker in 1997.

 **China** reported almost 700 new cases of **covid-19** on Monday, its highest tally in nearly two months. Most cases were recorded in the southern region of Guangxi and the north-western province of Gansu. Lockdowns have been imposed in both places. In Shanghai, the financial capital, officials launched a campaign to test around 20m people to [prevent another lockdown](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/16/in-stamping-out-covid-china-has-stomped-on-confidence).

Sajith Premadasa, **Sri Lanka** ’s opposition leader, withdrew from the race to replace Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the disgraced former president who [fled the country](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/13/sri-lankas-president-flees-leaving-the-country-in-chaos) amid widespread protests. Mr Premadasa pledged his support for Dullas Alahapperuma, a candidate from a breakaway group of the ruling party. Mr Alahapperuma will challenge Ranil Wickremesinghe, the acting president, and Anura Dissanayake, a leftist leader, in a vote in parliament which takes place on Wednesday.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

Chuck Schumer, America’s Senate majority leader, said he would call a vote on a $52bn package of subsidies to **chipmakers** as soon as Tuesday. Two years in the making, the legislation was prompted by fears that China’s semiconductor industry has [raced ahead](https://www.economist.com/business/america-has-a-plan-to-throttle-chinese-chipmakers/21808959) of America’s. Senators are expected to vote on a pared-down version of the bill, which scraps other provisions related to American competitiveness.

The London listing of **Arm** , a British chip designer, was delayed amid Britain’s political instability, according to the <em>Financial Times</em>. SoftBank, the company’s Japanese owner, had been lobbied by British politicians to list Arm, one of Britain’s few tech [success stories](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/06/22/why-everyone-wants-arm), in London. Though SoftBank had considered a dual-listing in London and New York, the resignation of Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, reportedly prompted a change of plan.

Swedish-born pop artist **Claes Oldenburg** , known for turning everyday objects into monumental sculptures, died in Manhattan. The 93-year-old artist’s subjects included a baseball bat, an apple core and a [clothespeg](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2016/12/24/a-celebration-of-the-oddly-modern-oddly-mystical-clothespeg). In 2009 his sculpture “Typewriter Eraser” sold for $2.2m at auction in New York. 

 **Fact of the day:** £30.5bn, the opening market capitalisation of Haleon, the largest new entrant on the London Stock Exchange since 2011. [Read the full article](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/07/18/haleons-listing-shows-the-woes-of-the-london-stock-exchange).

## Europe’s deadly heat

On Tuesday temperatures in Britain hit a record-breaking 40°C. Things are even worse elsewhere in Europe, where a severe heatwave has sparked enormous wildfires in Greece, Portugal and Spain; hundreds are thought to have died. Midwestern and Southern parts of America are enduring a historically hot summer, too. And last week cities in eastern and southern China sweltered through unusually high temperatures.

Heatwaves are becoming more frequent, and worse, because of climate change. They are also more likely to happen simultaneously across countries. This could be because it is hotter everywhere: with each fraction of a degree of global warming, temperature spikes become more extreme. Or it might be because climate change is altering the jet stream—the name given to air currents that snake through the upper atmosphere—though the link is not yet clear. Either way, millions if not billions of people are struggling with higher temperatures that they are not prepared for. Many [thousands will die](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/07/03/the-danger-posed-by-heatwaves-deserves-to-be-taken-more-seriously).

## Putin and Erdogan in Iran

The presidents of Russia and Turkey are in Iran on Tuesday to discuss the war in Syria. All three countries are involved in the conflict, and all want it to end. Russia’s Vladimir Putin and Iran’s Ebrahim Raisi, backers of the Syrian government, will offer each other firm support. The role of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey’s leader, is more complicated: Turkey backs opposition forces in Syria, although it has often sought Russia’s consent to launch armed offensives against Kurdish insurgents based in the country’s north. But Mr Erdogan is currently planning another such operation, and this time Russia and Iran want him to stop. At a separate meeting Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, warned Mr Erdogan not to launch the offensive. 

The leaders may also discuss [Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis), where their relationship is equally tangled. Turkey has sold drones to Ukraine, while Iran reportedly plans to help arm Russia. And Mr Erdogan hopes to help avert a global [food crisis](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/05/19/the-coming-food-catastrophe) by creating a safe naval corridor for grain exports through the Black Sea; Russia has been blockading Ukraine’s ports. In Tehran the Turkish president hopes to persuade Mr Putin to agree to a deal. For this tense trio, though, that will not be easy.

## Seeking answers in Aspen

America’s security and foreign-policy elite gathers in Colorado on Tuesday for the Aspen Security Forum, a four-day talkfest about the gloomy state of a fast-changing world. Attendees include Jake Sullivan, Joe Biden’s national security advisor, and William Burns, the head of the CIA. Much has changed since their virtual meeting last year, when the Taliban did not yet rule [Afghanistan](https://www.economist.com/afghanistan), Russia had not yet invaded [Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis) and [inflation](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/07/13/american-inflation-tops-forecasts-yet-again-adding-to-recession-risks) had not yet rocketed.

These new challenges provoke many questions, but few clear answers. Can America help beat back Russia’s invasion? Can it hold the line against China in Asia? Can its economy thrive amid the disruptions of war, covid and high energy prices? Indeed, can America revitalise its own democracy given polarisation at home? Defeating Russia could provide new confidence. But a [long war](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/06/30/how-to-win-ukraines-long-war) looms in Ukraine, and after the mid-term elections in November, America’s Congress may tire of[ providing](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/17/is-america-growing-weary-of-the-long-war-in-ukraine) tens of billions of dollars’ worth of arms and aid. The Aspen crowd has its work cut out.

## Netflix’s big cliffhanger

The last instalment of Netflix’s earnings, in April, [shocked shareholders](https://www.economist.com/business/netflix-sheds-subscribers-and-170bn-in-market-value/21808847). Not only had the company lost 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter, but bosses warned it was likely to shed 2m more in the second, around 1% of total subscribers. That news sparked a share-price crash and left investors on the edge of their seats. On Tuesday the cliffhanger will end as the company reports its second-quarter earnings—and investors will learn just how many subscribers have left.

Netflix is working on a revival plan, including a subscription tier with adverts, which it thinks could boost revenues. Hoping to increase the number of subscribers, bosses are trying to crack down on the sharing of passwords. But as inflation grows and consumers cut back on spending, Netflix faces an uphill battle. It will have to make its own spending cuts too. That makes the release of “The Gray Man” this week rather awkward. With a budget of $200m, it is Netflix’s most expensive film yet.

## Bye-bye to the mystery of “American Pie”

When Don McLean’s ubiquitous folk anthem, “American Pie”, starts to play, fans know they are in for nearly nine minutes of cryptic references to rock ’n roll history, the Vietnam war and America itself. The song, which hit number one in 1972, captured several generations: it has over 500m plays on Spotify. To celebrate its 50th anniversary, a documentary released on Paramount+ on Tuesday explores the song’s influence—and its mysterious lyrics.

In “The Day the Music Died” Mr McLean, who has long been cagey about the meanings in the lyrics, recalls he wrote all its verses in just one hour. That might explain why, disappointingly, the lyrics are revealed to be less interesting than fans might like. The “Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost” refers to the actual Holy Trinity; not, as some have speculated, John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King junior. Bob Dylan is not “the jester” and Elvis is not “the king”. Listeners searching for meaning will come up as dry as Mr McLean’s levee.
