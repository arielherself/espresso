A Russian missile killed two people in <strong>Poland</strong>, the country’s foreign ministry said. The explosion at a grain store in Przewodow, near the border with Ukraine, came amid a wave of Russian strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure. Moscow denied responsibility for the incident, which would mark the first time in the war that Russian weapons have struck a [NATO country](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/poland-will-play-an-outsized-role-in-western-efforts-to-assist-ukraine/21808064). Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, called an urgent meeting of the national-security council, while the foreign ministry summoned the Russian ambassador.

Russian <strong>long-range missiles</strong> struck targets across Ukraine including <strong>Kyiv</strong>, the capital, damaging more crucial energy infrastructure. At least half of the city is without electricity according to the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko. Elsewhere, the Russian army withdrew further from towns on the eastern side of the Dnieper river, opposite the city of [Kherson](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/14/kherson-celebrates-liberation-and-a-visit-from-volodymyr-zelensky), the southern provincial capital it abandoned last week.

G20 countries announced a $20bn fund to help <strong>Indonesia</strong> use less <strong>coal</strong>. In return, [Indonesia](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/11/14/indonesia-is-poised-for-a-boom-politics-permitting) promised that its power-sector CO2 emissions will peak at 290m tonnes by 2030, seven years earlier than previously forecast. The package of grants and concessional loans, from public and private sources, is modelled on an $8.5bn deal struck with [South Africa](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/01/22/south-africa-the-worlds-coal-junkie-tries-to-quit) last year.

<strong>Kevin McCarthy</strong> won the Republican party’s nomination for speaker of <strong>America’s House of Representatives</strong>, beating Andy Biggs, a devotee of Donald Trump, by 188 to 31. The Republicans look likely to wrest control of the House from the Democrats, albeit with a slim majority and deep internal schisms. Despite [losses in key races](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/10/after-the-midterms-america-and-its-democracy-look-stronger), the hardline bloc is large enough to stop Mr McCarthy reaching the 218 votes he needs to officially become speaker in a House-wide contest in January.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, Volodymyr Zelensky, thumbed his nose at Russia by addressing the “leaders of the G19” at the G20 summit in Indonesia. In a video address Mr Zelensky called for <strong>Russia’s</strong> “aggressive” war against his country to “end justly”. A draft resolution is circulating at the conference, which [opened on Tuesday](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/11/13/the-dynamics-of-distrust-around-the-g20-summit), stating that “most members strongly condemn” the war in Ukraine. Russia says “politicisation” of the summit is unfair.

<strong>Walmart</strong>, a jumbo American supermarket chain, reported strong third-quarter revenues of $153bn, a rise of 8.7% compared with the same period last year. The company’s stocks rose by more than 7%. The firm also agreed to pay $3.1bn to American states and cities, which accuse the retailer of contributing to the opioid crisis by failing to regulate prescriptions, although it has not admitted liability.

<strong>Alaa Abd el-Fattah</strong>, Egypt’s most high-profile [political prisoner](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/11/09/who-is-alaa-abd-el-fattah), ended the hunger strike he started in April, according to his family. [Mr Abd el-Fattah](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/11/09/who-is-alaa-abd-el-fattah), a British-Egyptian activist who protested against the Egyptian government, began refusing water on November 6th, to coincide with the COP27 summit. His case has drawn attention to <strong>Egypt’s</strong> human-rights record, with campaigners, celebrities and world leaders calling for his release.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 10.4bn, the size at which the global population is expected to peak, sometime between 2080 and 2100. [Read the full story.](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/11/11/the-worlds-population-has-reached-8bn-dont-panic)

## Donald Trump (probably) runs again

“I will very, very, very probably do it again,” said Donald Trump this month at a rally in Sioux City, Iowa. On Tuesday Mr Trump will make his intention to run for president in 2024 official. At least, very, very, very probably.

America’s former president may be motivated by more than politics. Returning to the White House could protect him from some of the [legal cases](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/05/how-much-legal-jeopardy-is-donald-trump-in) that are mounting against him. Originally he wanted to announce his bid on the eve of the midterms, but Republican leaders talked him down. Given the underwhelming performance of Trump-endorsed candidates, advisers have reportedly encouraged him to delay again.  
  
 Mr Trump may see an advantage in entering the field ahead of [Ron DeSantis](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/11/10/ron-desantis-and-other-winners), the governor of Florida, and Mike Pence, his former vice-president. Boosted by the Democrats’ [better than expected](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/11/13/the-democrats-keep-control-of-the-senate) results, President Joe Biden wants [another run](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/14/donald-trump-and-joe-biden-both-want-to-run-again), too. A contest between Mr Biden and Mr Trump would be a grudge match almost nobody wants.

## Jokowi plays statesman at the G20

Its Indonesian host, [President Joko Widodo](https://te.arielherself.xyz/jokowi-interview), calls this G20 summit, which began on Tuesday, the “most difficult” yet. Motivated by domestic issues, Jokowi (as he is known) has rarely cared for the global stage. But dialogue is his new mantra.

Jokowi tried hard to get Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, and Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, to join him at the luxury hotel in Bali. Mr Putin stayed away, but Mr Zelensky spoke by video to what he pointedly called, to exclude Russia, the “G19”. A leaked draft of a statement agreed by G20 diplomats condemned Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, and the economic dislocation it has caused, in stronger terms than many in the West expected. 

Elsewhere, little progress is expected around issues of global governance. And despite Jokowi’s efforts to create a genial atmosphere, the worsening relationship between [China and America](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/11/13/the-dynamics-of-distrust-around-the-g20-summit) is the elephant in the ballroom. A meeting between their presidents, Xi Jinping and Joe Biden, on Monday, was reassuring. But their list of gripes is extensive.

## The world’s eight billionth person

On Tuesday the world reaches a [milestone](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/11/11/the-worlds-population-has-reached-8bn-dont-panic). The global population, according to UN projections, will reach 8bn. Twelve years have passed since the world passed the [7bn milestone](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2011/10/22/now-we-are-seven-billion), and 6bn was passed 12 years before that. 

The rate of growth has fallen. This year the population is forecast to have risen by just 0.8%, the slowest rate since the 1950s and a third of the peak in 1963. Women are choosing to have fewer children and between now and 2050, the UN thinks, 61 countries will see their populations fall by at least 1%.

The global population is like a train: slam the brakes on and it stops, but only eventually. According to the UN, it will take 15 years to add the next billion people, and 21 years to reach the billion after that. The world is coming to an inflection point: the momentum of growth that has prevailed since the 1950s is being replaced by stability and stasis.

## Binyamin Netanyahu’s path to power

On Tuesday the 120 politicians elected on [November 1st](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/02/netanyahu-seems-on-track-to-be-israels-next-prime-minister) as members of Israel’s parliament will meet for the first time in Jerusalem. For now Binyamin Netanyahu, a former prime minister, is still the leader of the opposition.  
  
 Mr Netanyahu has been endorsed by a majority of the Knesset’s incoming members. On Sunday he received a mandate from Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, to form a new government. But his route back to the prime minister’s office is not simple. First he must sign coalition agreements with the assortment of [far-right](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/11/03/who-is-itamar-ben-gvir-israels-kingmaker) and religious parties who comprise his majority. They have a long list of [demands](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/10/the-changing-nature-of-israeli-politics), including legislation that would weaken the Supreme Court and funding for Jewish schools. Hardliners also want to control important ministries including defence, public security, education and finance. Many Israelis would [balk](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/10/israels-centrists-should-back-binyamin-netanyahu) at that. Having fought so hard to win a majority, Mr Netanyahu may struggle to control it.

## Walmart rides the inflation rollercoaster

Walmart, the American supermarket giant, spooked investors earlier this year with a series of profit warnings as rising fuel and food prices led consumers to cut back spending on other items. That forced Walmart to sell excess stock at a discount, crimping its margins. Markets sensed a bad omen for the wider economy.

Since then the firm has staged a robust recovery. In a quarterly results update on Tuesday the firm said its inventory glut was largely behind it and revised its sales forecast for the year upward. Inflation in America is coming down, easing pressure on customers’ wallets, but remains high enough that wealthier shoppers are still turning to Walmart for bargains. The Beast of Bentonville is also [toughening up with suppliers](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2021/11/20/walmart-gets-its-bite-back) and pushing back on price rises. A good quarter for Walmart, in other words, does not necessarily mean a good quarter for everyone else.
