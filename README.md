<strong>Ukrainian</strong> officials urged residents of <strong>Kherson</strong> to evacuate as Russian forces escalated their attack on the [southern city](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/11/15/the-battle-for-kherson-in-maps), which was liberated in November having been occupied by the Russians since the start of the war. Russian shelling of the city has intensified in recent days, causing hundreds to flee. Many of the strikes appear to have been aimed at civilian targets, such as a maternity hospital hit on Tuesday night.

<strong>America </strong>announced that travellers from <strong>China </strong>will have to produce a negative covid-19 test on arrival, as of January 5th. Earlier this week China’s government announced that it would end[ mandatory quarantine](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/12/07/china-is-loosening-its-covid-restrictions-at-great-risk) for inbound travellers in January, causing record numbers of Chinese to prepare to go overseas. Italy, India, Japan, Malaysia and South Korea have already announced similar measures.

<strong>ExxonMobil</strong> is suing the <strong>European Union</strong> over the bloc’s [new windfall tax](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/09/15/how-the-eu-intends-to-collect-windfall-profits-from-energy-firms) on oil companies. The lawsuit, filed by the oil major’s Dutch and German subsidiaries on Wednesday, argues that the Council of the EU does not have the legal authority to impose the tax—which is aimed at the extra profits fossil-fuel firms are enjoying because of high energy prices—because it is normally a power of sovereign countries.

<strong>Kosovo </strong>shut its main border crossing with <strong>Serbia </strong>amid [renewed tension between the two countries](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/12/20/kosovo-and-serbia-are-on-the-verge-of-conflict-again) over Kosovo’s status as an independent nation. Protesters gathered on the Serbian side of the border in support of ethnic Serbs inside Kosovo, who staged mass walk-outs of state institutions last month. Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vucic, put the military on its highest alert level; America and the EU called for “maximum restraint”.

<strong>Pope Francis </strong>asked for prayers for his predecessor, <strong>Pope Benedict XVI</strong>, whom he said was “very sick”. The signs are that Benedict, who is 95, is close to the end. In 2013 Benedict became the first pontiff to resign in 600 years. Styling himself as “pope emeritus”, he has lived in the Vatican ever since, serving as a conservative counterpoint to the more liberal [Francis](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/12/20/pope-francis-has-failed-to-be-a-spiritual-mediator-in-ukraine).

<strong>Binyamin Netanyahu</strong>, the incoming prime minister of <strong>Israel</strong>, finalised deals to form a coalition, according to the parties involved. Mr Netanyahu is now expected to swear in his [new government](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/10/a-netanyahu-government-may-raise-the-temperature-in-a-boiling-west-bank)—one of the most right-wing in Israeli history—on Thursday. On Tuesday the country’s parliament passed controversial legislation which will allow Mr Netanyahu’s allies to take up important government positions.

A Supreme Court judge in <strong>Brazil </strong>issued a ban on carrying firearms in Brasilia, the capital, ahead of the presidential inauguration of [Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/lulas-second-term-as-brazils-president-will-be-difficult). The order prohibits registered gun owners from carrying firearms until January 2nd—the day after the inauguration. Political violence has surged in Brazil since leftist Lula defeated far-right incumbent Jair Bolsonaro in October’s presidential election.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 47,496, the number of nursing vacancies in Britain’s NHS, currently gripped by strikes. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/12/19/british-nurses-launch-unprecedented-strikes).

## 2023 in preview: Will Taiwan be the Ukraine of Asia?

<em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will shape Asia?</em>

In 1949, at the end of China’s civil war, the defeated Nationalist regime was chased to Taiwan by Mao Zedong’s Communists. Since then every leader of the Communist Party has vowed to unify Taiwan with mainland China, but none as strongly as Xi Jinping, China’s current president. Some American generals think that China will invade in the next decade, perhaps within the next few years. In 2022 tensions flared when Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of America’s House of Representatives, travelled to the self-governing island. President Joe Biden has promised to come to Taiwan’s aid in the event of an attack. In a further effort to deter a Chinese attack, on December 27th Taiwan announced it will extend its compulsory military service from four months to a year.

But the [war in Ukraine](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/will-taiwan-be-the-ukraine-of-asia) may affect the calculus on all sides. America hopes the conflict will convince Taiwan to show greater willingness to defend itself. Russia’s struggles in Ukraine will give China’s leaders pause. If an invasion of Taiwan turned into a similar quagmire it would have disastrous consequences for the Communist Party.

## 2023 in preview: Asian housing markets are looking precarious

<em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will shape Asia?</em>

In the capital cities of South Korea and Taiwan, average house prices are now 19 times and 16 times local incomes respectively. Those levels are even higher than the most expensive in the West. But the forces that drove housing booms in East Asia—rock-bottom global interest rates and strong Chinese growth—are [rapidly abating](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/asian-housing-markets-are-looking-precarious). As in America, inflation is rising, along with interest rates.

There are other threats, too. Surging energy prices have eliminated the previously healthy current-account surpluses in South Korea and Taiwan. Deficits now make those countries more dependent on flows of international capital, which are fickle. Capital flight can cause property prices to plunge.

Japan provides a worrying example. In 1989-90 property prices began to slump. That drove frugality by corporations and consumers, which all but halted Japan’s economic growth. The similarities that are emerging among Japan’s neighbours should be a source of apprehension.

## 2023 in preview: Has China reached the peak of its powers?

<em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will shape Asia?</em>

At the Communist Party’s five-yearly congress in October, Xi Jinping secured a third term as party chief. He also warned the 2,300 delegates in Beijing to be ready to withstand “dangerous storms” ahead.

China is [weaker than it might otherwise be](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/has-china-reached-the-peak-of-its-powers), thanks to Mr Xi. For example, he failed to prepare the public to live with covid-19 by stockpiling drugs and more widely administering vaccines and booster shots. Yet this month [he ditched](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/12/06/china-is-dismantling-its-zero-covid-machine) most covid controls, leading to a wave of sickness that risks overwhelming the health system.

The sagging economy and demographic challenges also worry the party. For years the share of old people has been rising, while the workforce contracts. Some think that all this means China is at the peak of its powers. A slower-growing China will have fewer resources with which to challenge the West. But a weak China could be more dangerous. If it still wants to reshape the world—or seize Taiwan—some observers fear that China will act soon, while it can.

## 2023 in preview: India will become the world’s most populous country

<em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will shape Asia?</em>

In 2023 (on or around April 14th, guesses the UN) India will seize China’s crown as the[ world’s most populous country](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/14/india-will-become-the-worlds-most-populous-country-in-2023). The crown itself has little value, but it is a signal of things that matter. China’s population is poised for a steep decline; India’s will continue to grow for decades. 

The growth in India’s working-age population should help its economy narrow the gap with China’s, which is six times larger. But to get the full benefit of its demographic advantage India will have to boost the productivity of its youthful people. Less than half of adult Indians are in the workforce, compared with two-thirds in China. Chinese aged 25 and older have on average 1.5 years more schooling than Indians of the same age. China is not about to fade into insignificance. But it will have to contend with India as an emerging superpower on its doorstep.
