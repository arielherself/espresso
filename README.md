<strong>Hungary’s</strong> prime minister, Viktor Orban, said his country’s parliament will ratify Finland and Sweden’s accession to <strong>NATO</strong> early next year, a move that would leave only Turkey yet to approve the Nordic countries’ membership. Meanwhile, Ukraine continued to reckon with the consequences of Russia’s strikes on its infrastructure, which caused mass [blackouts](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/23/in-ukraine-living-as-normal-is-an-act-of-defiance). The head of Ukraine’s nuclear agency, Energoatom, said the strikes risked “catastrophe” after the Zaporizhia nuclear plant was again disconnected from the national grid. Earlier <strong>Ukraine’s </strong>president, Volodymyr Zelensky, accused <strong>Russia </strong>of “crimes against humanity”, while addressing the UN Security Council. 

The king of <strong>Malaysia </strong>chose <strong>Anwar Ibrahim </strong>to become the country’s prime minister, after an election on November 19th resulted in a [hung parliament](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/11/21/a-hung-parliament-in-malaysia-augurs-more-bad-government-and-instability). Malaysians waited five days for a new leadership to emerge, as the incumbent coalition failed to make an alliance with its rising challengers. Mr Anwar waited for much, [much longer](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2020/10/03/anwar-ibrahim-is-in-a-familiar-place-close-to-leading-malaysia). The 75-year-old has led Malaysia’s opposition as a liberal-democratic reformer for most of his career, including years spent [in prison](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2015/02/12/malaysias-dark-side).

The <strong>European Commission’s</strong> proposals for a <strong>cap on gas prices</strong> met a frosty response at a meeting of EU energy ministers, who will gather in December to agree on a plan. The EC’s proposal included capping prices only when they exceeded €275 ($284) per megawatt-hour, and if [European prices](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/11/24/the-costs-and-consequences-of-europes-energy-crisis-are-growing) diverged from those of global LNG. Poland’s climate minister, Anna Moskwa, called the plan a “kind of joke”. 

The <strong>UN</strong>’s Human Rights Council launched an investigation into [<strong>Iran</strong>’s lethal crackdown](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/12/despite-lethal-repression-irans-protests-continue) on the protests that have engulfed the country since mid-September. The council voted to establish an international fact-finding mission to probe allegations of what the UN’s human-rights chief called “unnecessary and disproportionate use of force”. An estimated 400 Iranians have been killed, and some 15,000 arrested, amid protests sparked by the death in custody of [Mahsa Amini](https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2022/09/28/im-the-same-as-mahsa-and-i-want-my-freedom-anger-at-irans-regime-spills-onto-the-streets), who was arrested for not “properly” wearing her hijab.

<strong>Twitter</strong> shut its office in Brussels, sparking fears among EU officials that the social-media platform will not follow EU rules on [<strong>moderating online speech</strong>](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/04/30/free-speech-idealism-will-clash-with-laws-and-reality), as the fallout from Elon Musk’s takeover continues. Before he bought Twitter Mr Musk suggested he wanted to [reduce](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/04/30/elon-musk-wants-to-re-engineer-the-public-square) its moderation rules in order to create a digital “public sphere” that enshrines free speech.

The judge presiding over <strong>Brazil’s </strong>electoral court slapped down a [legal challenge](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/11/23/jair-bolsonaros-challenge-to-brazils-election-was-rejected) filed by Jair Bolsonaro against the outcome of [the election that unseated him](https://te.arielherself.xyz/films/2022/10/31/lula-wins-the-brazilian-election) as president. On Wednesday, just a day after the challenge was filed, the judge affirmed the victory of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and for good measure imposed a $4.3m fine on Mr Bolsonaro’s side, for litigating in bad faith.

<strong>Russia’s </strong>parliament passed a law that broadens the scope of an existing ban on promoting “LGBT propaganda” to children. The ban will now pertain to information disseminated to anyone, regardless of age. Russia’s LGBT communities have [long suffered persecution](https://te.arielherself.xyz/prospero/2020/07/09/welcome-to-chechnya-uses-deepfake-technology-to-protect-its-subjects) from the authorities, who cast the new legislation as a defence of traditional values in contrast with Western decadence. 

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>$63bn, the amount that firms have raised from IPOs on Chinese exchanges this year, compared with $21bn in New York. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/22/xi-jinpings-big-bang-for-chinese-stockmarkets).

## Opening Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago documents

Since August [Donald Trump](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/11/16/donald-trump-declares-that-he-will-make-america-great-again-again) has sought to thwart a government [probe](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/08/10/the-raid-on-mar-a-lago-could-shake-americas-foundations) into classified documents that the FBI seized from his home in Florida. The former president’s lawyers had early success in persuading a district-court judge to restrict investigators’ access to the documents and appoint an independent reviewer, known as a “special master”, to screen them for material protected by executive privilege.

But on appeal the case has trended against Mr Trump. Following a hearing on Tuesday at the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals—where judges were sceptical that courts should “interfere with the executive branch’s ongoing investigation” in a criminal matter—the skirmishing seems likely to end in the justice department’s favour. A ruling giving investigators access to the documents could come at any time after Thanksgiving.

Last week [Merrick Garland](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/08/17/merrick-garland-is-not-naive-about-political-violence), the attorney-general, [named Jack Smith as special counsel](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/05/how-much-legal-jeopardy-is-donald-trump-in) to take on both the Mar-a-Lago documents and Mr Trump’s role in the January 6th insurrection. A quick ruling could sweep a major obstacle from Mr Smith’s path.

## The EU squabbles over an energy price cap

Another month, another packed agenda for EU energy ministers as they meet on Thursday. A warm autumn has offered some respite from dizzying wholesale energy prices. But policymakers are already [bracing](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/01/how-to-prevent-europes-energy-crunch-spiralling-into-an-economic-crisis) for a difficult 2023.

The main topic of discussion is a cap on the price of gas used to generate electricity, proposed by the European Commission on Tuesday. Opponents, notably gas-dependent Germany, fear that such a cap may lead suppliers to reduce shipments to Europe, thus intensifying the energy crisis. But advocates of a cap are not thrilled with the commission’s proposal either. The ceiling is set at a lofty €275 ($284) per megawatt-hour, and would apply only when European wholesale prices diverge from those of global liquefied natural gas (as they did over the summer). Another proposal on the table is to speed up the rollout of renewable energy to reduce Europe’s dependence on gas. That is less controversial, and probably a lot more [effective](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/09/27/the-wrong-way-to-solve-europes-energy-crisis).

## A fundraising tour for Cuba’s president

On Thursday Cuba’s Communist president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, will land in [China](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2019/09/14/what-a-new-chinese-restaurant-in-havana-says-about-cuba) to ask its president, Xi Jinping, for economic help. His rare trip abroad—which also took him to Algeria, Russia and Turkey—is a sign of desperation. The gradual deterioration of Cuba’s economy under six decades of dictatorship has been exacerbated by tighter American sanctions during Donald Trump’s administration, the pandemic, and now inflation. [Food is scarce](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2021/07/01/cuba-is-facing-its-worst-shortage-of-food-since-the-1990s) and expensive, and [power outages](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/10/06/cubans-rage-against-the-dying-of-the-light) afflict Havana, the capital.

Yet Mr Díaz-Canel has reason for optimism. His four hosts may find that footing a moderate bill to help 11.3m Cubans is worth it to poke a stick at America. Algeria’s government, for example, has already agreed to export oil and gas to Cuba and donate a solar plant. China may also consider restructuring or even forgiving Cuban debt, and could offer technical assistance in energy and farming. But despite such relief, until the Communist Party loosens its grip, Cuba will be forced to depend on its allies.

## South Korea’s economic quagmire

When the Bank of Korea’s monetary policy committee met on Thursday Rhee Chang-yong, its governor, raised the interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 3.25%, [as expected](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/10/interest-rates-have-risen-sharply-but-is-monetary-policy-truly-tight). Failure to keep up with America’s Federal Reserve, which hiked rates to 3.75% on November 2nd, could have triggered capital flight from South Korea, further weakening the won.

But increasing rates also carries risks. Bond markets have been in turmoil for almost two months since the governor of Gangwon province refused to pay back creditors who bought bonds issued to fund the construction of Legoland, an amusement park. A U-turn from the Gangwon government, and an injection of liquidity into the corporate-bond market, did little to calm investors. With personal debt levels high, the central bank is under pressure to keep rates steady to avoid defaults and fend off a recession. Mr Rhee has warned of “growing signs of stress”. He may be talking about himself as much as the [economy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/03/05/south-koreas-economy-threatens-to-become-like-japans).

## Volodymyr Zelensky, speechmaker

After Russia’s invasion, the speeches of Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, were beamed to parliaments, award ceremonies and [front pages](https://te.arielherself.xyz/films/2022/03/28/an-exclusive-interview-with-volodymyr-zelensky) around the world. A new collection of Mr Zelensky’s speeches will be published on Thursday. Proceeds from its sales will go to “United24”, an initiative that channels donations to the Ukrainian state itself. 

“A Message from Ukraine” includes 16 speeches, spanning Mr Zelensky’s hopeful inauguration in 2019 to his wartime call to arms in 2022. (It also features a preface by <em>The Economist</em>’s Russia editor.) The collection displays the president’s firm grasp on the emotions of his audience—a skill honed during his earlier career as an actor and comedian. And it showcases Mr Zelensky’s well-chosen historical references, designed to suit the audience of the day. Speaking to Britain’s parliament, he echoes Winston Churchill; to the German Bundestag, he invokes the Berlin Wall. Before the war, many thought [Mr Zelensky’s backstory](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/07/07/the-many-lives-of-volodymyr-zelensky) made him unsuitable for office. Now his experience as an entertainer seems his greatest strength.
