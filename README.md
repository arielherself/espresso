**Italy’s** president dissolved parliament following the resignation of **Mario Draghi** , the prime minister, and called for elections within 70 days. Mr Draghi will remain in a caretaker capacity until then. He stepped down on Thursday after three parties in his coalition sat out a [vote of confidence](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/21/mario-draghi-italys-reformist-prime-minister-resigns) in his government on Wednesday. He won the vote 95-38, but it was a hollow victory: there are 321 senators. 

The **European Central Bank** raised interest rates by **0.5 percentage points** on Thursday, its first increase in 11 years. The bank also approved a new **bond-buying programme** to try to avert a fresh euro-zone debt crisis. The rise was higher than the ECB’s pre-announced plan, which proposed an increase of 0.25 percentage points.

Germany’s energy regulator said that **gas** resumed flowing west through the **Nord Stream 1** pipeline on Thursday morning, at about 40% capacity. On Wednesday the European Commission encouraged the EU’s member-states to prepare by cutting their gas usage by 15%. For over a week Europe has worried that when **Gazprom** restarts supply—officially halted for maintenance—Russia will [reduce flow as retaliation](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter) for the EU’s support of Ukraine. 

 **Amazon** said it would buy 1Life Healthcare, an American **health care** company, for $3.9bn. 1Life operates One Medical, a membership primary-care service that offers both in-person and virtual appointments. Since 2019 Amazon has had some success in the medical market with its Amazon Care offering. But an earlier joint venture with JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway, called Haven, failed.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

President Joe Biden said that the Pentagon thinks it is “not a good idea” for **Nancy Pelosi** , the speaker of America’s House of Representatives, to visit **Taiwan** . On Wednesday **China’s** foreign ministry had said it would take “strong measures” if Ms Pelosi travelled to the territory, over which [it claims sovereignty](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2022/06/28/our-former-asia-columnist-on-what-to-read-to-grasp-the-looming-crisis-in-taiwan). Mr Biden himself has made [a habit](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/05/23/what-is-americas-policy-of-strategic-ambiguity-over-taiwan) of overstating America’s commitment to defending [Taiwan’s autonomy](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/06/23/america-and-china-spar-over-the-taiwan-strait).

 **China** fined **Didi** , a ride-hailing company, more than $1bn over “vile” breaches of the country’s data security laws. The fine amounts to about 5% of its revenue in 2021 and would end a months-long investigation into the firm’s cyber-security practices. Didi has [struggled](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/06/09/the-communist-party-resuscitates-didi-global) ever since it angered Chinese regulators by listing on the New York stock exchange last year despite being told not to do so.

 **American Airlines** reported record quarterly revenue results of $13.4bn. The company announced a net income of $476m. When adjusted for one-off events, that made for its first quarterly profit since the start of the **covid-19 pandemic** . But despite a summer surge in traveller numbers, challenges remain for the airline, including staffing shortages—but the airline predicted a profitable third quarter nonetheless.

 **Fact of the day:** 0.03, the number of deaths associated with one terawatt-hour of electricity produced from nuclear-power plants. [Read the full article](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/07/19/how-safe-is-nuclear-energy).

## The last episode of the January 6th hearings

On Thursday the eighth and final hearing of the congressional [January 6th committee](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/07/the-january-6th-committee-is-about-to-reveal-its-findings) will take place—on prime-time television. The committee, set up to investigate the storming in 2021 of the Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump, has been methodical. Millions of people have watched each of its hearings, tuning in to hear a familiar story lent texture by damning detail. They have heard allegations of schemes to press Mike Pence, the vice-president, into stealing the election; to remove the attorney-general; and even to force the Secret Service to bring Mr Trump to the Capitol while the attack was under way.

Thursday’s hearing will dissect the former president’s inaction over the course of the day. The committee’s aim has plainly been to sketch out the contours of a potential federal prosecution of Mr Trump. A separate grand-jury probe in the state of Georgia is also advancing. The shadow of the 2020 election will loom over American politics for a good while longer.

## Putin restarts gas flowing to Europe–for now

On Thursday morning, as scheduled, gas once again started flowing through Nord Stream 1. European political and business leaders had been [waiting for the moment with bated breath](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter). Since the pipeline—which carries more than one-third of Russia’s exports of natural gas to western Europe via Germany—was shut off on July 11th for maintenance work, worries have abounded about whether Vladimir Putin would allow it to be turned back on. He did. But the gas is currently flowing at only about 40% capacity. 

Russia had previously reduced the volume of gas coming through the pipe by 60% in June, blaming technical snags. Then Mr Putin claimed it needed a gas turbine that was sent to Canada for repair. But Europe’s leaders suspect [more nefarious](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/14/europes-winter-of-discontent) motives, and have been fearing further cuts.

More disruption would intensify Europe’s soaring energy costs and add to punishing inflation. The EU is preparing for the worst: the European Commission has drawn up a proposal for governments to cut gas consumption by 15%. A [difficult winter](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/30/can-europe-keep-the-lights-on-this-winter) lies ahead.

## The ECB goes further than expected

The European Central Bank on Thursday raised interest rates by 0.5 percentage points, its first rise in 11 years. That was 0.25 percentage points higher than it had previously indicated. Dramatic[ inflation](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/06/23/how-fighting-inflation-could-imperil-the-euro-zone)—prices rose at an annual rate of 8.6% in June—has forced its hand. Interest rates had to rise to cool the euro zone’s economy.

The war in Ukraine has sparked an[ energy crisis](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/05/europes-economy-grapples-with-an-acute-energy-shock), and most confidence indicators are already pointing to a slowdown. But on balance the ECB has prioritised battling inflation even with the risk of courting recession.

Rates are only part of the job. The bank has also released the details of a[ bond-buying programme](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/15/the-european-central-bank-responds-to-market-turmoil) to ensure that the bond yields of highly indebted countries—particularly Italy—do not blow out, potentially triggering another Italian debt crisis. Italy itself plunged into turmoil on Thursday when its prime minister resigned. The already delicate job of being a banker at the ECB is not likely to get easier.

## Turkey’s mad monetary theory

In Brussels, London and Washington, the topic of conversation at central banks is not whether to raise interest rates to contain inflation, but by how much. In Ankara, things are different.

When Turkey’s central bank meets on Thursday, the rate-setters did not increase rates at all. That was entirely expected. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, believes that higher [interest rates](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/erdogans-zany-monetary-experiment-is-impoverishing-turkey/21806459) are the cause of high inflation, not a cure for it. Those who think otherwise, he recently said, “are either illiterates or traitors”. He has duly sacked three central-bank governors who disagree.

Evidence is not on Mr Erdogan’s side. Inflation in Turkey has [surged](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/14/turkey-grapples-with-triple-digit-inflation) to almost 80% since the bank slashed interest rates late last year, putting pressure on consumers. A recent poll found that more than one-third of Turks are unable to meet their basic needs. But there is no sign of a U-turn. Interest rates in Turkey duly remained unchanged on Thursday—because Mr Erdogan says so.

## A marvellous return for Comic-Con

For the first time since the pandemic, over 100,000 nerds, many dressed as their favourite characters, will descend on San Diego for Comic-Con, a jamboree for fans of caped crusaders, animated robots and toys of all kinds. Geek culture has lost some of its lustre in the past three years, thanks to a glut of films set within the [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/09/17/how-marvel-took-over-cinema-and-tv). But at SDCC, which starts on Thursday, studios will do their best to impress.  
  
 Attendees can expect glimpses of a Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie, a “Game of Thrones” spin-off and Amazon’s $1bn “Lord of the Rings” television series. But the stars of the convention will, as usual, be superheroes. DC, which owns [Batman](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2016/03/28/50-years-of-batman-on-film-how-has-his-physique-changed) and Superman, has teased trailers for “Black Adam” and a second Shazam film. And though Disney, whose ownership of Marvel makes it the market leader of comic-book geekery, will likely save the biggest announcements for its own expo in September, it will still have plenty to show off. Expect a trailer for the new Black Panther film to set the internet ablaze.
