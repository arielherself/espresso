<strong>Joe Biden </strong>gave a prime-time speech in which he warned that <strong>American democracy </strong>was “under assault” from followers of Donald Trump. And, though speaking vaguely, he seemingly compared the philosophy underpinning the MAGA movement to “semi-fascism”. With the campaign for midterm elections in November gathering pace, the American president said that “MAGA Republicans represent [an extremism](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/01/american-states-are-now-petri-dishes-of-polarisation) that threatens the very foundations of our republic”—drawing a distinction between the Make-America-Great-Again crowd and relatively moderate members of the GOP. Senior Republicans retorted that it is Mr Biden who is the divisive force. 

The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog left the <strong>Zaporizhia nuclear plant</strong> in Russian-occupied territory in southern Ukraine. Five inspectors will remain at the facility for several more days. The UN aims to set up a permanent monitor at the power station, which has been the [site of intense shelling](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/08/19/what-is-at-stake-at-ukraines-zaporizhia-nuclear-plant) in recent weeks. Ukraine hopes the inspection will lead to the “demilitarising” of the plant but Russia says it will not withdraw its forces.

<strong>Russia </strong>pledged to stop [selling oil](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/06/07/russia-is-pumping-more-oil-to-europe-than-it-was-before-the-war) to countries that impose a price cap on its imports of the black stuff—a ceiling which the G7 is expected to approve on Friday. Meanwhile Ravil Maganov, the chairman of <strong>Lukoil</strong>, Russia’s second-largest oil producer, and a critic of the war in Ukraine, died after falling from a hospital window in Moscow. Officials said he committed suicide; his associates think that unlikely. An extraordinary series of Russian energy bigwigs have died suddenly this year.

Pilots at <strong>Lufthansa</strong>, a German airline, went on <strong>strike</strong> on Friday, forcing the firm to cancel about 800 flights. Around 130,000 passengers are affected, some of whom are stranded in Frankfurt and Munich. [Airlines](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/06/09/air-travel-is-taking-flight-again) have scrapped thousands of departures this summer as companies face staff shortages and strikes just as demand has picked up after long lockdowns.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

A man pulled a gun on <strong>Cristina Fernández de Kirchner</strong>, Argentina’s former president and current vice-president, in an apparent assassination attempt. She was greeting supporters after attending her ongoing [corruption trial](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/08/25/argentinas-vice-president-could-face-12-years-in-prison) in Buenos Aires. The gun, aimed inches from her face, failed to fire, and Ms Fernández was unhurt. A Brazilian man has reportedly been arrested.

A judge in <strong>Myanmar </strong>was reported to have convicted <strong>Aung San Suu Kyi</strong> of electoral fraud and sentenced her to three years’ hard labour. Ms Suu Kyi, the long-serving leader of her country’s democracy movement, was arrested when Myanmar’s military junta seized [complete control of the country](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2021/02/01/aung-san-suu-kyi-is-arrested-as-myanmars-generals-seize-power) in early 2021. Until then she had been the de facto leader of an elected government.

<strong>Starbucks</strong>, the world’s biggest coffee chain, named Laxman Narasimhan as its next chief executive, replacing its founder, Howard Schultz. He will be tasked with implementing a “reinvention plan” to improve [conditions](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/05/26/new-trade-unions-in-america-are-successfully-using-company-brands) for both workers and customers. Mr Narasimhan will join the company in October but will only take the reins in April 2023. He is currently boss of Reckitt, a consumer-goods giant.

## Hiring in America

America’s labour market is “clearly out of balance”, [groused Jerome Powell](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/30/central-bankers-worry-that-a-new-era-of-high-inflation-is-beginning), chair of the Federal Reserve, last week. Demand for workers has outstripped supply, pushing up private-sector wages by more than 5% year on year. Yet while the Fed’s interest-rate rises have tightened financial conditions elsewhere—share and property prices are [down](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/03/an-anatomy-of-this-years-market-mayhem), the [dollar is stronger](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/07/20/why-the-dollar-is-so-strong)—the jobs market has remained red-hot. To policymakers’ relief, data released on Friday will probably show that hiring slowed in August. Forecasters reckon employers added 300,000 jobs last month, compared with 528,000 in July.

Labour-market conditions are likely to determine whether the Fed increases rates by half or three-quarters of a percentage point in September. Its task is a balancing act: raise rates high and fast enough to temper jobs and wage growth, without triggering mass lay-offs and tipping the economy into recession. The weaker the jobs data, the softer the landing should be. 

## Iraq’s violent political deadlock

The Internationale Funkausstellung, otherwise known as the IFA, opens its doors in Berlin on Friday. Europe’s biggest annual technology show is being held in person for the first time since the start of the pandemic. It is mainly a platform for manufacturers to show off the latest in consumer electronics.

Thus, with the football World Cup looming in November, ever-higher resolution televisions will be much in evidence. LG is due to unveil the largest ever OLED television screen, at a whopping 97 inches (246cm). Other gadgets are likely to include a “smart” toilet developed by Samsung, which neutralises human waste, as well as shoe cases that do the same for the odour of smelly feet. There will be new smartphones too, but not the 14th iteration of the iPhone. Apple shuns such trade shows. It will launch the device at its own event, on September 7th in Silicon Valley.

## Germany’s trade figures fail to lift the gloom

In May Germany recorded only a small trade surplus of €800m ($795m). Exports recovered in June, thanks to increased demand from America and China, and Germany notched up a (seasonally adjusted) surplus of €6.4bn. But that fell to €5.4bn in July, according to figures published on Friday by Destatis, Germany’s statistics agency. 

The decline, however modest, will only add to the gloomy mood amongst exporters. Sky-high energy prices, supply-chain bottlenecks and the rising cost of raw materials are all worries. The Ifo Institute, a German think-tank, produces an index of exporter expectations; it fell for the third consecutive month in August.

For some companies the cost of production has become so burdensome that they are forced to reject or cancel orders, according to a recent survey by FTI-Andersch, a consultancy. Firms are reluctant to pass on increased costs to customers. And with energy prices and other production costs still high, the winter months are likely to be tougher still. 

## Lord of the Dollars

Streaming companies deploy several strategies to drum up interest. One is to throw lots of money at new projects. Another is to talk about how much money is being thrown. Enter “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power”, a television series released on Amazon Prime in most countries on Friday. Reportedly the most expensive series ever made, the first season alone has a rumoured price tag of $465m. 

Despite Amazon’s seemingly bottomless coffers, the tech company’s streaming service has repeatedly disappointed. “The Lord of the Rings” is pure spectacle, featuring an ensemble of elves, humans and hobbits exploring sweeping vistas. But the show also risks losing itself in its expensive theatrics. For the series to achieve Amazon’s dream of winning a “giant, global audience”, it will have to make viewers care about the characters. After all, the idea behind the success of the original is simple: the power of ordinary people to confront evil.
