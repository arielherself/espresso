<strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong>, the speaker of America’s House of Representatives, [landed in Taiwan](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/08/02/nancy-pelosis-trip-to-taiwan-highlights-americas-incoherent-strategy). Ms Pelosi is the most senior American politician to visit the self-governing island in 25 years. The visit underscores “America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant democracy,” said Ms Pelosi, on Twitter. She is expected to meet Taiwan’s president Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday. Earlier the White House warned China against sabre-rattling; Chinese state media reported that fighter jets were flying across the Taiwan Strait. Ms Pelosi’s visit will strain America’s relations with China, which claims Taiwan as sovereign territory.

<strong>President Joe Biden </strong>confirmed that <strong>Ayman al-Zawahiri</strong>, the leader of <strong>al-Qaeda</strong>, was [killed in Afghanistan by an American drone strike](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/02/the-death-of-al-qaedas-leader-may-not-halt-a-jihadist-resurgence) over the weekend. Mr Zawahiri was second-in-command during the plotting of the September 11th attacks and took over after Osama bin Laden was killed in 2011. He returned to Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, after the Taliban took over last year. Mr Biden said that “justice had been delivered,” and warned that America would not allow Afghanistan to become a “terrorist safe haven” again.

<strong>Uber</strong> recorded its first ever positive quarterly cash flow as the ride-hailing service was boosted by an increase in trips following the pandemic. The company announced free cash flow, defined as revenue from operating activities minus capital expenditures, of $382m in the three months to June, well above analysts’ predictions. Despite the good news, Uber still posted a quarterly net loss of $2.6bn, partly due to [poorly performing investments](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2021/02/20/why-chinas-didi-can-succeed-where-uber-has-struggled).

The <strong>Ukrainian</strong> infrastructure minister said it will be months before <strong>grain exports</strong> from Odessa and nearby ports return to prewar levels, despite Russia lifting its blockade. On Monday [a ship carrying grain left Odessa](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/01/the-first-grain-ship-leaves-odessa-under-a-un-brokered-deal) for the first time since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. But Oleksander Kubrakov said he expected only five vessels to set sail in the next two weeks. 

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Europe’s</strong> imports of <strong>Russian diesel</strong> rose by more than a fifth in July, showing the challenge the continent faces in cutting energy supplies from Russia. Imports from the country reached nearly <strong>700,000 barrels </strong>a day, an increase of 22% compared to July last year. The EU has pledged to [stop importing](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/05/31/why-the-oil-price-is-spiking-again) Russian diesel by February 2023.

<strong>Manufacturing activity</strong> in America expanded at its slowest pace in two years in July, as more factories reduced output because of lower demand. <strong>Britain’s</strong> manufacturing sector reported the same thing. Factory output has also fallen across Europe and in Asia. Oil prices fell by 4% on Monday amid fears of a [global recession](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/07/24/why-it-is-too-early-to-say-the-world-economy-is-in-recession).

<strong>Pakistan’s</strong> election commission ruled that the party of Imran Khan, the [former prime minister](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/06/02/imran-khan-is-jeopardising-pakistans-attempts-to-fix-its-economy), had received illegal funds. The ruling could result in Mr Khan and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party being banned from participating in politics. A spokesman for Mr Khan denied any wrongdoing and said the funds were received from Pakistanis living overseas.

## Nancy Pelosi visits Taiwan

Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of America’s House of Representatives, [landed in Taiwan](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/08/02/nancy-pelosis-trip-to-taiwan-highlights-americas-incoherent-strategy) on Tuesday evening. She is the most senior American politician to visit the self-governing island in 25 years. Chinese fighter jets have been flying close to the informal military boundary in the Taiwan Strait, seemingly as a demonstration of how quickly they could reach Taiwan. The White House has [warned China](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/07/21/talk-of-nancy-pelosi-visiting-taiwan-angers-china) against turning the visit into “some sort of crisis” or using it as a “pretext” to increase aggressive military activity.

Xi Jinping, China’s leader, cannot be seen as weak on Taiwan as he seeks a third term in office. He has made reunification with Taiwan, by force if necessary, one of his key aims. China’s government spokesman has warned that Ms Pelosi’s visit will “lead to egregious political impact”. Many worry the brinkmanship could result in some kind of violent confrontation, whether deliberately or by accident.

## What flourishes in the desert? Arizona’s primaries

Arizona has long been the petri dish for the paranoid strains of American politics, from the heyday of Barry Goldwater in the 1960s to its obsession with birtherism during Barack Obama’s presidency. Now another strain is setting in. On Tuesday, Republican voters are expected to nominate candidates for the offices of governor, secretary of state and senator who all agree that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. Unsurprisingly, all have been endorsed by Donald Trump, the former president, who has been playing primary kingmaker and remains consumed with relitigating his electoral defeat.

It is not the only contest that day that gives a glimpse into the future of the Republican Party. Voters in Kansas will decide in a referendum that would allow for sweeping bans on abortion. Some have already gone into effect in other states after the Supreme Court overturned [<em>Roe v Wade</em>](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/06/26/the-fallout-from-overturning-roe). Those who had hoped for moderation in the party after Mr Trump’s defeat will have to wait a while longer.

## Ceasing a ceasefire in Yemen

Months of hope have given way to fear. A four-month ceasefire in Yemen is due to expire on Tuesday. Since 2015 the country has been ravaged by fighting between the Houthis, a Shia militant group, and a Saudi-led coalition. The truce brought a measure of calm. Oil tankers could anchor at Hodeida port, easing a fuel crisis in Houthi-controlled areas. The airport in Sana’a, the capital, resumed commercial flights for the first time in nearly six years.

But the Houthis refuse to extend the truce. Nor have they delivered on their commitment to reopen roads into Taiz, a city they have besieged for years. Instead they have used the lull to recruit new fighters (while also breaking the ceasefire more than 1,500 times). There has been no progress towards a long-term political settlement. After a short respite, many Yemenis fear another round of fighting is soon to begin.

## Australia tightens its monetary policy, again

The Reserve Bank of Australia lifted interest rates on Tuesday for the fourth month in a row, in an attempt to dampen inflation. New data show that prices were 6.1% higher in the three months to June than a year earlier—below what was expected, but still the fastest increase in 21 years. Inflation will rise to almost 8% by Christmas, the Treasury warns. So the central bank raised interest rates by 0.5 percentage points, to 1.85%.

Its decisions are coming under increasing scrutiny. In July Australia’s new centre-left Labor government launched an independent review of the bank, covering everything from its performance and policy tools, to the make-up of its board. One issue in particular has rankled indebted Australians: they grumble that the Reserve Bank did not warn them that it would start tightening monetary policy. But the gripes are unlikely to deter the bank’s policymakers, who are desperate to keep a lid on inflation.

## Meet Pyra, master of Thailand’s “dystopian pop”

Unable to perform during a covid-19 lockdown in Thailand, Peeralada Sukawat—a singer better known by her stage name, [Pyra](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/07/28/a-thai-pop-star-uses-her-music-to-critique-her-homeland)—took to TikTok to release short clips in which she criticised what she called the “dictatorship regime”. She didn’t think that anyone would care. But her clips were watched by hundreds of thousands. Many viewers shared her disillusionment; soon abuse flooded in, too. 

Thailand’s authoritarian government has often tried to silence critics by locking them up. Fearing reprisals, Pyra moved to London to pursue her brand of “dystopian pop”. The regime change she seeks seems unlikely to come soon. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the prime minister who seized power in a coup in 2014, can serve for no more than eight years according to Thailand’s constitution. His time should be up this month. But a court is expected to extend the limits of his term on a technicality. For now, Pyra is happier in her adopted country; she feels that she “can finally breathe”.
