<strong>Taiwan</strong> scrambled jets to deter 20 <strong>Chinese </strong>aircraft, 14 of which had crossed the Taiwan Strait’s median line, as part of China’s most provocative military drills in decades<em>.</em> The island’s government accused China of simulating an invasion on the third day of its exercises. China had previously [fired missiles](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/08/04/china-sends-missiles-flying-over-taiwan) over Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, and sent warships across the median line. On August 5th China halted talks with America on several topics following the [visit](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/03/nancy-pelosi-has-left-taiwan-the-real-crisis-may-be-just-beginning) of Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of America’s House of Representatives, to Taiwan on Tuesday.

<strong>Israeli</strong> air strikes on the <strong>Gaza Strip</strong> killed 15 people, including a child, according to the Palestinian health ministry. Several members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militant group—including one of its leaders, Tayseer al-Jaabari—were among the dead. Israel arrested 19 PIJ members and warned that its operation could last for a week. Hundreds of rockets have been fired at Israel from Gaza since Friday, according to an Israeli official, although there have been no casualties.

<strong>Russian</strong> forces began an assault on Bakhmut and Avdiivka, two cities in Donetsk, one of two provinces in the Donbas region of eastern <strong>Ukraine</strong>, where fighting has been concentrated. The governor of Donetsk said that five civilians had been killed and 14 injured in the region in the past day. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces are preparing for an [assault on Kherson](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/28/ukraine-is-gathering-strength-for-an-assault-on-kherson), a city in the south, which Russia occupied in March.

<strong>Russia</strong> and <strong>Ukraine</strong> blamed each other for shelling at the Zaporizhzhia <strong>nuclear</strong> plant in southern Ukraine. The UN’s nuclear watchdog said any artillery exchange near the facility amounted to “playing with fire”, and called for the “utmost restraint”. Shelling on Friday prompted Ukrainian technicians at the nuclear site to disconnect one of its [six reactors](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/03/04/europes-largest-nuclear-plant-shuts-down-after-a-russian-attack). Europe’s largest nuclear plant, Zaporizhzhia has been under Russian control since March.

Oksana Pokalchuk, the head of the <strong>Ukrainian </strong>branch of <strong>Amnesty International</strong>, quit, citing differences with the human-rights organisation’s leadership. On Thursday Amnesty accused Ukraine’s armed forces of endangering civilians by stationing troops in residential areas (officials say they evacuate civilians from areas with fighting). President Volodomyr Zelensky warned that Amnesty’s claims would fuel Russian propaganda. Ms Pokalchuk said she had tried unsuccessfully to encourage the group to amend its position.

Warren Buffett’s company, <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>, reported a loss of nearly $44bn in the second quarter of 2022. The value of its investments sank by $53bn, with big drops in the share price of three of its biggest investments—Apple, American Express and Bank of America. Berkshire Hathaway’s operating earnings (Mr Buffett’s preferred measure, which excludes the undulations of share prices) rose to $9.3bn. Profits also rose at many of the 90 or so companies that the firm owns outright.

California’s Department of Motor Vehicles accused <strong>Tesla </strong>of producing “untrue or misleading” advertisements that overstated the efficacy of the Autopilot and Full Self-driving features available with some of its electric cars. The agency could suspend Tesla’s licence to sell cars in the state, and order it to pay compensation to customers. Tesla, which is run by Elon Musk, acknowledges that its autonomous features require driver supervision.

<strong>Word of the week:</strong> <em>Ganbei</em>, a Chinese term meaning “drink up”. The word is often used when people try to bring up life under China’s covid-19 lockdowns, according to one psychologist.

## A resurgence of violence in Gaza

On Friday Israel launched a series of strikes on Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip. It is the first major spate of violence in the beleaguered coastal enclave since an 11-day conflict in May 2021. At least 15 people in Gaza have been killed. In retaliation, the militants have fired hundreds of mortar shells towards Israel, according to the Israeli military. Many have been intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome missile-defence system; there have been no Israeli casualties so far.

Israel claims it struck preemptively. It is targeting Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a small outfit backed by Iran. Hamas, a much bigger Islamic movement which rules Gaza, has stayed out of the fighting thus far. That is reason to hope that the flurry of attacks may cease within days. But that may not come to pass. Gaza has been under siege by Israel and Egypt since 2007, when Hamas took control in a coup. Its history shows that escalations can be rapid, and ceasefires tenuous.

## Anglicanism reveals its deep divisions

Sunday marks the end of the Lambeth Conference, a decennial meeting of Anglican bishops in Canterbury and London that is part Bible study, part plenary discussion. The bishops, who shepherd 85m worshippers worldwide, spent 12 days discussing the direction of their church in the 21st century. But they leave the conference with conflicting ideas about the next ten years of the church—especially on gay rights.

A draft motion called on bishops to reaffirm Resolution 1.10, a controversial text from the 1998 Lambeth Conference that rejected “homosexual practice as incompatible with scripture.” Lambeth motions are not binding, but carry sway within the church. This year’s proposal was eventually softened. But the Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches, which represents around 75% of the faithful and focuses on parts of the world (such as Africa) where the denomination’s reach is growing, released its own text in support of Resolution 1.10. Like the much larger [Roman Catholic](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/07/14/catholic-reformers-want-big-changes-to-a-church-marred-by-sex-abuse) church, Anglicans face a gaping divide between reformers and traditionalists.

## All eyes on Taiwan’s performing arts

As China holds [massive live-fire exercises around Taiwan](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/08/04/china-sends-missiles-flying-over-taiwan), the island’s capital will open the new Taipei Performing Arts Centre on Sunday. The futuristic complex, designed by star Dutch architects, is set amid one of the city’s busiest night markets. Among other things it will give Taipei sorely needed theatre space, especially as two of the centre’s stages can be merged into a 2,300-seat “super theatre”, as well as breathing room for avant-garde works, which have previously been confined to open or industrial spaces. 

Rem Koolhaas and David Gianotten, the architects of the centre, tell <em>The Economist</em> that Taiwan’s 24m people see theatre as especially relevant to their lives. The island’s troubled history and blend of eastern and western influences spark creative dynamics, they argue. The centre’s inaugural season of 142 performances will reflect that. It will include both classical acts, such as Wei Hai-min, a superstar of Peking opera, a style of performance popular around China, as well as more adventurous shows, such as a new work for Dance Forum Taipei, a contemporary Taiwanese dance company, by Marina Mascarell, a renowned Spanish choreographer.

## A new airline takes off in India

Tycoons have always been lured by the airline business. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, a billionaire Indian investor, is the latest example. On Sunday Mr Jhunjhunwala’s venture, Akasa (“sky”) Air, takes off with a flight between Mumbai and Ahmedabad. The airline’s goal is to become “India’s greenest, most dependable and most affordable airline”. To get there, it plans to procure 20 jets by the end of 2023. Cabin crew will don bright-orange uniforms made from recycled fabric and branded sneakers, a first for an Indian airline. 

But merely becoming profitable will be the biggest challenge. Competition among low-cost airlines in India is fierce. With lockdowns lifted, passenger demand has soared. But so have fuel costs. Caps on fares have also squeezed margins. Staff are disgruntled with wages, and airlines are struggling to hire more workers. Customers are also fed up: 80% of Indian passengers in a recent survey said that airline service in the country is terrible. Akasa faces a turbulent start.

## Weekend profile: Gustavo Petro, a former guerrilla and Colombia’s next president

Latin America is known for leftist revolutionaries, from Che Guevara to Hugo Chávez. Yet a leftist ruler was once unthinkable in Colombia. For 52 years the government was at war with a Marxist guerrilla movement called the [FARC](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/07/07/some-ex-farc-guerrillas-have-become-tourist-guides-in-colombia). By 2016, when the armed conflict ended, it had become the longest in the Western hemisphere. But on Sunday Gustavo Petro [assumes the presidency](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/06/20/how-gustavo-petro-a-former-guerrilla-might-govern-colombia) of Colombia.

As a 17-year-old Mr Petro joined the April 19th Movement, an urban guerrilla group known as the M-19. A low-level functionary, in 1985 he was in prison for allegedly storing weapons when the M-19 stormed Colombia’s Supreme Court. The arrival of the army resulted in a shootout, in which about half of the court’s judges were killed in crossfire, along with nearly 100 other people (Mr Petro appears to have had no involvement in the event).

After M-19 demobilised in 1990, Mr Petro entered politics. He became famous as a congressman for exposing links between politicians and right-wing paramilitary groups, and for calling out corruption. But he was less successful as mayor of Bogotá, Colombia’s capital, a job he held from 2012 to 2015. Mr Petro developed a reputation as a dictatorial boss and was briefly suspended after mismanaging the municipal restructuring of a private rubbish-collection service.

Today Mr Petro still harbours some of his youthful idealism. He has promised to provide all unemployed Colombians—11% of the labour force—with a state job, and to make public higher education free. He wants to prohibit new licences for oil and gas exploration, though extractive industries make up around half of Colombia’s exports. Yet Mr Petro’s revolutionary spirit has been somewhat tempered. He picked José Antonio Ocampo, a moderate who is sceptical about offering state jobs to the unemployed, as his finance minister. Mr Ocampo will serve alongside several other centrist ministers.

And since the election in June Mr Petro has focused on building support among the established parties he once denounced. He has even met his arch-nemesis, Álvaro Uribe, a powerful right-wing former president. Most of Colombia’s big parties have promised to back Mr Petro. That may give him the parliamentary majority he needs to pass reforms, including a tax bill that will be his first major test in government. The rebel has become the peacemaker.
