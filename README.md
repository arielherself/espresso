<strong>President Joe Biden</strong> confirmed that <strong>Ayman al-Zawahiri</strong>, the leader of <strong>al-Qaeda</strong>, was [killed in Afghanistan by an American drone strike](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/02/the-death-of-al-qaedas-leader-may-not-halt-a-jihadist-resurgence) over the weekend. Mr Zawahiri was second-in-command during the plotting of the September 11th attacks, and took over after Osama bin Laden was killed in 2011. He returned to Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, after the Taliban took over last year. Mr Biden said that “justice had been delivered,” and warned that America would not allow Afghanistan to become a “terrorist safe haven” again. 

The White House warned <strong>China </strong>against using <strong>Nancy Pelosi’s</strong> [prospective visit to Taiwan](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/07/21/talk-of-nancy-pelosi-visiting-taiwan-angers-china) as a “pretext to increase aggressive military activity in or around the Taiwan Strait”. News reports suggest Ms Pelosi, the speaker of America’s House of Representatives, will arrive in Taiwan on Tuesday and meet President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday. She would be the highest-ranking American official to visit Taiwan since 1997. Chinese officials had threatened “strong and resolute measures” should she stop on the island.

Two people died and thousands were forced to evacuate as a [wildfire](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/02/23/extraordinary-wildfire-events-are-happening-more-often) torched 55,000 acres (22,258 hectares) in northern <strong>California</strong>. The McKinney fire, which erupted on Friday, is the state’s largest wildfire this year. Meanwhile the death toll in flood-stricken <strong>Kentucky </strong>reached 35, and is likely to rise further as hundreds of people remain unaccounted for, the governor said.

<strong>Manufacturing activity</strong> in <strong>America</strong> expanded at its slowest pace in two years in July, as more factories reduced output because of lower demand. <strong>Britain’s</strong> manufacturing sector reported the same thing. Factory output has also fallen across Europe and in Asia. Oil prices fell by 4% on Monday amid fears of a [global recession](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/07/24/why-it-is-too-early-to-say-the-world-economy-is-in-recession). 

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

America’s <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> charged 11 people in a <strong>crypto Ponzi scheme</strong>, alleging they bilked retail investors of more than $300m. Among those charged were the four founders of the venture, known as Forsage, who are thought to live in Russia, Georgia and Indonesia. Forsage had “no apparent source of revenue” other than funds received from investors, who made money by recruiting other participants, the SEC said in its complaint.

<strong>Japan</strong> is set to raise its <strong>minimum wage</strong> by a record amount to help low-income households cope with rising inflation. An advisory panel to the labour ministry has proposed raising the hourly wage by 3.3% to 961 yen ($7.3). [Inflation in Japan](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/06/23/the-bank-of-japan-v-the-markets) has exceeded the central bank’s target of 2% for three consecutive months.

<strong>Iran’s </strong>atomic energy chief, Mohammad Eslami, said that the country has the ability to build a<strong> nuclear weapon</strong>, but does not plan to do so. His comments will increase anxiety over Iran’s nuclear activities, which have increased since a deal to limit its nuclear programme, agreed in 2015, began to unravel after <strong>America</strong> withdrew its support under the presidency of Donald Trump.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>10%, the proportion of the Russian population that has experienced torture by law-enforcement agencies. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/07/28/vladimir-putin-is-in-thrall-to-a-distinctive-brand-of-russian-fascism).

## A nuclear free-for-all looms

The fabric of nuclear-arms control, woven after the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, has long been fraying. The [war in Ukraine](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/06/02/a-new-nuclear-era) may rip it entirely, as [Russia](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/07/28/vladimir-putin-is-in-thrall-to-a-distinctive-brand-of-russian-fascism) threatens to use nukes. A chance to patch it up comes on Monday, with the opening in New York of a month-long conference of 191 signatories of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

The agenda is forbidding: Iran is on the nuclear threshold; North Korea has crossed it; Britain is enlarging its arsenal; and China is building up fast. The global stockpile of 12,700 warheads is thus set to grow. Splits between big powers, and between nuclear haves and have-nots, may prevent agreement. Many have signed an alternative treaty to ban nukes altogether.

The good news? America and Russia still swap information about long-range weapons under New START. The bad? The treaty expires in 2026. Follow-on talks stopped after the invasion of Ukraine. There is no sign of them resuming soon—if ever.

## Less gas requires more solidarity

It is rare for industrial assets to be expropriated in Europe these days. But because it has done nothing to fill it up, Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, will on Monday lose its part of the Haidach natural-gas storage facility in Austria, one of the largest in central Europe. Another operator will take over the space. Yet the change in ownership will not do much to solve the [continent’s gas squeeze](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/28/the-eu-agrees-on-an-energy-diet-to-fight-russian-gas-cuts). It may run out of gas next spring.

If Gazprom keeps supply at just 20% of capacity through Nord Stream 1, the biggest pipeline providing Russian gas, it is unlikely that storage facilities across the European Union, currently 67% full, will reach the EU’s goal of 80%. If the firm reduces the flow even further or the winter is unusually cold (or both), facilities in some countries, particularly Germany, could run empty by March or so. Then the big question will be whether EU member states will show solidarity and share [whatever gas they have left](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter).

## Britain takes aim at dirty money

Any government serious about tackling [money-laundering](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-reads/2022/07/11/the-best-books-to-read-to-understand-financial-crime) needs to crack open anonymous shell companies. These can shield those using dirty dosh to buy assets, often swanky pads in places like London and Paris. On Monday [Britain](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/05/07/how-to-solve-britains-dirty-money-problem) will take a step in the right direction. A register of the “beneficial” (real) owners of overseas companies that hold British property will come into force. The idea is to force more transparency on those hiding behind brass-plate firms in tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands.

The move comes six years after Britain introduced a public register of owners of domestic companies. This was seen at the time as a global landmark in the fight against financial crime. But the lessons from it are sobering. Policing has been weak, with few prosecutions for submitting false data. The omens this time are not good, either. Despite feisty political rhetoric, British law enforcement lacks the funding needed to get a grip on the money-rinsers.

## Publishers’ antitrust battle

The proposed $2.1bn merger of Penguin Random House and Simon &amp; Schuster may reduce the North American book industry’s Big Five to just four. But first it has to get past the American Department of Justice’s [antitrust division,](https://te.arielherself.xyz/special-report/2022/01/10/the-growing-demand-for-more-vigorous-antitrust-action) which will argue in a trial beginning on Monday that the two publishers should be kept separate.

America’s antitrust enforcers normally keep firms apart over concerns that their market power would reduce supply and raise prices for consumers. But rather than base its case on arguments about fewer and more expensive books, the department will argue that the combined company would have too much power over authors’ pay, leading to less fierce bidding wars for writers’ works. The DoJ’s tactic is rare but not unprecedented. If it is successful, more cases focused on big firms’ power over wages could be on the way. 

## Wearable stickers to peer inside the body

Ultrasound captures images from inside the body in real time with high-frequency sound waves. Useful as it is, clunky equipment and clammy gel make it a cumbersome affair. It also requires the steady hand of a highly skilled sonographer. But now, as published in <em>Science</em>, researchers have invented a bioadhesive sticker that attaches to the skin. The size of a postage stamp, the stickers can take images of organs, tumours or embryos continuously for 48 hours.

In tests, the stickers provided high-resolution live images of volunteers’ insides. That could mean sonographers may no longer need to be present throughout surgeries, monitoring blood flow. But the real breakthrough would come if the stickers could be made wireless; people could buy them at the pharmacy and slap them on like plasters. Patients’ smartphones would do the rest—analysing the data and alerting them or their doctor. As easy to use as nicotine patches—only better for your health.
