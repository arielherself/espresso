America’s Securities and Exchange Commission charged <strong>Sam Bankman-Fried</strong>, the former boss of <strong>FTX</strong>, a cryptocurrency exchange, with defrauding investors. Mr Bankman-Fried was arrested on Monday in the Bahamas, where FTX was based, at the request of American prosecutors. More charges are due later on Tuesday and the Bahamas is expected to extradite him to America. Mr Bankman-Fried presided over the [implosion of FTX](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/11/17/the-failure-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried-will-leave-deep-scars) after it lent customers’ funds to his nominally separate trading firm.

Volodymyr Zelensky, <strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, asked G7 leaders for modern tanks and long-range weapons amid heavy fighting in his [country’s east](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/12/06/russia-is-hurling-troops-at-the-tiny-ukrainian-town-of-bakhmut). The G7 promised to “meet Ukraine’s urgent requirements”. Separately, <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>, Russia’s president, cancelled his regular year-end news conference. In the past he has allowed foreign press to pose questions at the event.

<strong>China </strong>withdrew its state-mandated “itinerary code” app that tracked people travelling to areas with high rates of <strong>covid-19</strong>. It is the latest sign that the authorities are [loosening](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/12/06/china-is-dismantling-its-zero-covid-machine) draconian lockdown restrictions after [protests](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/12/01/lessons-from-a-chinese-protest) erupted against them two weeks ago. The app’s removal comes ahead of Chinese New Year holidays next month when millions travel across the country to be with their families.

Members of the <strong>European Parliament</strong> in Brussels agreed to enforce the world’s first <strong>carbon border tax</strong>. The carbon border adjustment mechanism [imposes tariffs](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2021/07/15/the-eu-proposes-a-carbon-tariff-on-some-imports) on the imports of goods, such as cement and steel, to account for the carbon-dioxide emissions they generate. It seeks to prevent European firms outsourcing production to parts of the world with weaker environmental standards.

The largest [strikes](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/11/03/britain-faces-a-wave-of-industrial-action-this-winter) in <strong>Britain</strong> for a decade caused the loss of 417,000 working hours during October, according to the Office for National Statistics. A further 1m hours are expected to be lost in December as rail workers, postal workers, nurses and teachers demand better pay and conditions. Inflation and soaring [energy costs](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/11/24/britains-economic-outlook-is-very-gloomy) have created a cost-of-living [crisis](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/12/12/the-strange-case-of-britains-demise) in the country. 

<strong>Ghana </strong>reached an agreement for a $3bn bailout with the <strong>IMF</strong>, pending approval from the latter’s board.

<strong>Elon Musk</strong> disbanded <strong>Twitter’s </strong>Trust and Safety Council, an independent panel comprising around 100 civil-society groups that advised the social-media firm about handling hate speech, the sexual harassment of children and other thorny matters. Last week three members of the council resigned, complaining that since Mr Musk [took over](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/28/elon-musk-buys-twitter-at-last) the company in October, “the safety and wellbeing of Twitter’s users” has been “on the decline”.

## Sam Bankman-Fried charged with defrauding investors

On Tuesday Sam Bankman-Fried was to appear before Congress, to answer questions about the [collapse of FTX](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/09/the-spectacular-fall-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried), the crypto exchange he founded. Instead, on Monday evening he was arrested in the Bahamas, where FTX is based, at the request of American prosecutors. On Tuesday America’s Securities and Exchange Commission charged him with defrauding investors. More charges are expected. The Bahamas is expected to extradite him in short order.

Prosecutors have been probing whether Mr Bankman-Fried broke the law by loaning FTX customer funds to Alameda Research, his nominally independent trading firm. They have also been investigating whether he manipulated the market for two cryptocurrencies. 

Fraud charges require prosecutors to prove that a defendant knowingly deceived investors or customers. In several interviews since resigning as boss of FTX Mr Bankman-Fried has professed ignorance about how the firm transferred funds to Alameda and blamed others for the lax controls. His media strategy may offer a preview of his eventual legal defence: that he was simply hapless and misinformed. 

## High hopes for low inflation in America

Over the past year each brief deceleration in [inflation in America](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/10/19/why-inflation-refuses-to-go-away) has been followed by a strong rebound in price pressures. Investors and central bankers around the world will scrutinise the latest figures, due on Tuesday, to see whether this dismal pattern may be at an end. Forecasters reckon that the core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy costs, rose by 0.3% in November, its second straight month at that pace.

If correct, that would be the most subdued two-month run of inflation since 2021. The costs of many consumer goods are falling as supply-chain issues melt away. [Property prices](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/10/20/housing-markets-face-a-brutal-squeeze) are also weakening, weighed down by elevated [interest rates](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/02/the-fed-delivers-another-jumbo-rate-rise-and-its-far-from-done). But pressures are not about to disappear. In the ultra-tight labour market, wages are rising fast. As Russia’s war in Ukraine drags on, oil prices could easily soar again. Relief at any slowdown in inflation will be circumscribed.

## What African governments want from America

[China’s presence in Africa](https://te.arielherself.xyz/special-report/2022/05/20/the-chinese-african-relationship-is-important-to-both-sides-but-also-unbalanced) is subject to intense scrutiny by the West. [Russian interference](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/03/12/why-russia-wins-some-sympathy-in-africa-and-the-middle-east) on the continent worries Western governments, too. But America, one of the worriers, also has clout in the region. The arrival of dozens of African leaders in Washington on Tuesday, for the first US-Africa Leaders Summit since 2014, is testament to its role.

For many African countries America is an indispensable security ally. Its trade terms also offer preferential access to African exporters. And American humanitarian aid has saved millions of lives. Yet African politicians want more from their relationship with America, especially when their economies are suffering from the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and their own mismanagement. 

Donald Trump saw Africa through the prism of America’s contest with China. But Joe Biden wants to show that he takes the continent’s own agenda seriously. American officials say this summit is about listening to what Africans have to say. But Africans will still want to hear what America has to offer.

## How to rebuild Ukraine, from Paris

Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, are jointly hosting a conference in Paris on Tuesday on aid for Ukraine. Mr Zelensky is appearing by video link, while his prime minister, [Denys Shmyhal](https://te.arielherself.xyz/by-invitation/ukraines-prime-minister-says-reconstruction-planning-must-start-now/21808965), is in the French capital to drum up support for his war-battered country. Mr Shmyhal estimates that the [full-scale reconstruction](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/11/08/donors-are-already-mulling-a-marshall-plan-for-ukraine) of Ukraine will cost $750bn.

The conference has two parts. An international roundtable is considering how to help Ukraine survive the winter. Mr Macron wants pledges for the supply of generators, medical equipment and other aid. A further bilateral discussion will consider how French firms can help with reconstruction. 

The meeting comes when Mr Macron is keen to show that, despite suggestions [from eastern European allies](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/06/14/emmanuel-macron-seeks-to-advertise-his-support-for-ukraine) that he is soft on Russia, France is fully behind Ukraine. According to the Kiel Institute, a German research outfit, of EU countries only Germany has pledged more aid.

## World Cup semi-finals begin

On Tuesday Argentina and Croatia meet in the first semi-final of the football World Cup in Qatar. Argentina will look to avenge their early defeat by Croatia at the last World Cup, in 2018. But that will be easier said than done. The Croatians have a knack for winning games [against the odds](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/12/02/why-the-world-cups-first-stage-has-been-surprisingly-even). In their last match they shocked the pre-tournament favourites, Brazil, winning on penalties. And they have unfinished business of their own, having been runners-up last time around.

Whoever wins will face the victor of the second semi-final, between France and Morocco, on Wednesday. France, the defending champions, who beat Croatia in that final [in 2018](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2018/06/09/for-all-its-faults-the-world-cup-in-russia-is-worth-celebrating), are the odds-on favourites to win their semi-final and the whole competition. But Morocco has already progressed further than any African team before, beating Belgium, Spain and Portugal. Triumph against France—the country’s former colonial overlord—would add to the long list of [upsets](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/12/09/qatars-world-cup-has-seen-the-biggest-upsets-in-recent-history) in Qatar.
