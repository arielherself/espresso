<p align="center">Origin: <a href="https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-in-brief">https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-in-brief</a><hr>

A <strong>North Korean </strong>missile landed 60km from <strong>South Korea’s</strong> coast, the [first such launch](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/10/18/north-korea-is-preparing-for-another-nuclear-test-or-many) to cross the countries’ maritime border. Yoon Suk-yeol, South Korea’s president, called it an “effective territorial invasion” and promised a “swift response”. South Korea said at least 23 missiles were fired “east and west” on Wednesday. It responded by launching three missiles towards North Korea.

In his first public statement since [losing Brazil’s presidential election](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/10/31/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-will-be-brazils-next-president), <strong>Jair Bolsonaro</strong> made no mention of his defeat to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, though afterwards an aide said Mr Bolsonaro’s government would comply with the transfer of power. Mr Bolsonaro said those protesting in his support were expressing “injustice” about the vote. But he made no allegations of voter fraud and instructed his supporters to avoid “invading property”.

Volodymyr Zelensky, <strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, called for a “reliable and long-term defence” for grain exports from Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea. Three ships departed on Tuesday, despite Russia suspending the [deal](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/30/putin-suspends-a-deal-to-allow-grain-exports-from-ukraine) ensuring their safe passage. Meanwhile power and water were restored in Kyiv, the capital, following Russian strikes. The boss of Ukrenergo, the country’s energy supplier, warned that Russia wanted to create “a humanitarian catastrophe” this winter.

<strong>Binyamin Netanyahu</strong> said his party was on the “brink of a very big victory” in<strong> Israel’s</strong> [general election](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/27/israels-binyamin-netanyahu-bids-for-an-election-comeback). With roughly 85% of the votes counted, the former prime minister’s right-wing bloc looks set to form a majority government, toppling the coalition led by Yair Lapid. Mr Netanyahu was forced from office in 2021 amid accusations of corruption. 

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

The number of<strong> job openings</strong> in <strong>America</strong> rose to 10.7m in September, meaning there are nearly two vacancies for every person seeking work. That is a sign that the Federal Reserve’s [interest-rate rises](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/10/19/why-inflation-refuses-to-go-away) have yet to cool the labour market. But monetary tightening seems to have reduced demand for goods: <strong>manufacturing</strong> activity in October grew at its slowest pace since 2020.

Elon Musk, <strong>Twitter’s</strong> [new boss](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/28/elon-musk-buys-twitter-at-last), said he was planning to launch an $8-a-month subscription for “verified” users. That implies the platform’s “blue-tick” badge of approval might be open to those willing to pay from it, not just confirmed celebrities, journalists, politicians and the like. Mr Musk wants the social-media firm to find new sources of revenue. Currently most of its money comes from advertisers.

<strong>Uber’s </strong>share price leapt by more than a tenth after the ride-sharing firm said quarterly revenues grew by 72% year over year, to $8.3bn. Still, Uber booked a [net loss](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/31/what-went-wrong-with-snap-netflix-and-uber) of $1.2bn. <strong>Airbnb</strong>, meanwhile, had its most lucrative quarter ever, reporting a profit of $1.2bn. Revenues at the home-sharing firm rose by 29% year over year, to $2.9bn.

<strong>Fact of the day</strong>: 45,000, the estimated number of jobs that American tech firms have shed this year. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/31/what-went-wrong-with-snap-netflix-and-uber).

## A spyware scandal in Greece

Officials from the European Parliament are in [Greece](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/05/19/rows-over-press-freedom-overshadow-greeces-recent-achievements) on Wednesday to probe whether the ruling party used spyware to illegally snoop on politicians and a journalist. The government of Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the prime minister, has denied that it bought the Israeli-made Predator software (which is similar to the Pegasus [spyware](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2021/07/31/israel-is-loth-to-regulate-its-spyware-exports) used by governments including Mexico and Saudi Arabia). But the reluctance of officials to meet with investigators has fuelled worries that his New Democracy party was involved in an attempt last year to hack the phone of Nikos Androulakis, the leader of Pasok-Kinal, an opposition party.

A Greek parliamentary inquiry ended abruptly last month after government MPs blocked requests by opposition ones to call important witnesses. They included managers at Intellexa, an Israeli-controlled company based in Athens which sold Predator, and Mr Misotakis’s nephew, the then-chief of the cabinet office. The European committee may struggle to untangle such a web. But if it finds evidence that the government was behind the eavesdropping, it could blow up Mr Mitsotakis’s chances of winning a general election next spring. 

## Africa’s energy problem

This week delegates, lobbyists and bag-carriers begin trickling into Sharm El-Sheikh, in Egypt, for COP27, the United Nations’ annual climate summit. The event, which officially kicks off on Sunday, is being advertised as “Africa’s COP” with a focus on the continent.

As delegates haggle over how to reduce global emissions, they should remember how little energy Africa uses. An average person in sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa) uses about 180kWh a year, less than the average American fridge. 

If Africa is to grow richer, [its energy use must increase](https://te.arielherself.xyz/by-invitation/2022/05/14/yemi-osinbajo-on-the-hypocrisy-of-rich-countries-climate-policies). Renewable energy is essential, but Africa cannot rely on it alone. More gas, which is polluting but cleaner than coal, is needed in the mix. But, despite happily importing fossil fuels, governments in the West mostly now refuse to finance new fossil-fuel projects in Africa or poor countries elsewhere. Those negotiating at COP27 should acknowledge that green growth in the region is a worthwhile goal—but it should not come at the cost of turning on the lights.

## Infrastructure disasters in India

Opened in 1879, Jhulto Pul “hanging bridge” was the biggest tourist attraction in Morbi, a Gujarati town. Now it is the site of India’s [latest man-made disaster](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/02/17/indias-omicron-wave-recedes-but-not-the-risk-of-premature-death). On October 30th, four days after the pedestrian suspension bridge reopened following maintenance work, its cables snapped, plunging several hundred people into the Machchhu river. On Wednesday Gujarat will mark a day of mourning for the victims. 

Oreva, the company which operates the bridge, has blamed people for swaying the walkway. But its employees are among the nine people arrested so far over the collapse. Ahead of state elections in December, opposition parties have alleged corruption over the way Oreva, chiefly a clock-maker, was awarded the bridge contract by the municipality of Morbi and the government of Gujarat, which are controlled by the Bharatiya Janata Party. Narendra Modi, India’s BJP prime minister, has ordered a “detailed and extensive” inquiry. The Supreme Court will open an investigation on November 14th. Indians will not expect much. Post-mortems following similar tragedies have done little to improve governance or shoddy engineering.

## British prime ministers on screen

In a recent self-promotional video [Rishi Sunak](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/10/27/rishi-sunak-britains-new-prime-minister-starts-on-the-defensive), Britain’s prime minister, appears to be modelling himself on the clean-cut, shirt-sleeved occupant of 10 Downing Street played by Hugh Grant in “Love Actually”, a romantic comedy. The slickly produced clip has been mocked online, but there are not many other fictional role models for Mr Sunak to choose from.  
  
 Whereas cinema’s American presidents are often noble and brave, British prime ministers on screen are usually self-serving schemers. Francis Urquhart (Ian Richardson) in “House Of Cards” is a Machiavellian murderer; Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) in “The Ghost Writer” is a CIA stooge; Vivienne Rook (Emma Thompson) in “Years And Years” is a fascist; and in “Doctor Who” Harold Saxon (John Simm) is the Doctor’s arch-enemy, the Master. A more benign example is Jim Hacker (Paul Eddington) in “Yes, Prime Minister”; he was merely an amiable bungler. British screenwriters rarely make their prime ministers heroes. Given the [scandals](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/07/07/boris-johnson-should-go-immediately) and [upheavals](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/28/how-not-to-run-a-country) of recent months, that is not likely to change.
