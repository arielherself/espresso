<strong>Gautam Adani</strong>, India’s richest man, began selling $2.4bn-worth of shares in ​​Adani Enterprises, his sprawling conglomerate, despite an attack by a short-seller. Hindenburg Research [accuses](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2023/01/26/hindenburgs-critique-of-the-adani-empire) the wider Adani Group of dodgy accounting practices that it says artificially inflated the share price—a charge the group vigorously denies. The mud seemed to be sticking: Adani Enterprises’ share price dropped by 17% on Friday; Adani Total Gas’s sank by 20%.

<strong>Palestinian</strong> militants fired two rockets towards <strong>Israel</strong> from Gaza, both of which were intercepted by air defences, before Israel launched retaliatory strikes. Earlier, Israeli troops killed ten Palestinians and wounded others during a [military raid](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/05/14/shireen-abu-aqleh-was-killed-covering-an-israeli-raid) on Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. Israeli forces said they were targeting Islamic militants. It is the deadliest such incident in years.

<strong>South Korea’s</strong> national [pension fund](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/12/05/can-you-afford-to-retire) will run out by 2055—two years earlier than expected—according to an official forecast. The service, which is the world’s third largest, had 915trn won ($743.1bn) of funds at the end of October. South Korea’s president, Yoon Suk-yeol, had promised sweeping pension [reforms](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/10/27/asias-vast-financial-institutions-are-being-enlisted-to-defend-currencies) to counter the effects of a shrinking population and low economic growth.

Five former <strong>police officers</strong> in Memphis were charged with <strong>murdering</strong> Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old black man. Mr Nichols died on January 10th from injuries sustained after a traffic stop turned violent. Body camera footage, to be released on Friday, is said to show an “appalling” attack carried out by [the officers](https://te.arielherself.xyz/special-report/2022/09/12/-stopping-the-spiral-of-murder-and-violent-crime), all of whom are black. They were fired earlier this month.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Britain’s chancellor,</strong> Jeremy Hunt, outlined his long-term plan to boost economic growth. He said the government will delay tax cuts until it has curbed inflation, which ran at 9.2% in December. [Britain’s government](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2023/01/23/rishi-sunaks-hapless-government) faces criticism for overseeing soaring living costs and industrial sluggishness, including a collapse in [British carmaking](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2023/01/24/britains-carmaking-industry-is-increasingly-under-threat). Mr Hunt rejected “declinism” and said Britain could become the next Silicon Valley.

Sayfullo Saipov, an Islamist extremist who [killed](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2017/11/02/new-york-is-attacked-again-but-remains-remarkably-safe) eight people when he drove a truck onto a <strong>Manhattan</strong> bike path in 2017, was convicted of 28 federal charges. He could face the <strong>death penalty</strong>, a rare consideration in New York. America’s attorney-general issued a [moratorium](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2021/01/21/use-of-the-death-penalty-in-america-may-be-ending) on federal executions in 2021, but allowed prosecutors to seek the death penalty in this case.

<strong>Hasbro</strong>, an American toymaker, said it would axe around 15% of its workforce, about 1,000 staff. Demand for its consumer products, which include Dungeon &amp; Dragons and Peppa Pig, slumped over the holiday period, even as its gaming division grew. The firm reported preliminary sales of $5.9bn in 2022, down by 9% compared with the year before.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 775,014, the number of cars that emerged from British factories in 2022, the worst year since 1956. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2023/01/24/britains-carmaking-industry-is-increasingly-under-threat).

## Disney marks its centenary

The happiest place on earth will be even jollier on Friday, as celebrations begin at Disneyland for the company’s [100th birthday](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2023/01/19/as-disney-turns-100-its-business-is-on-a-rollercoaster-ride). Disney’s first century has been a triumph: today the studio rules the worldwide box office, it has more streaming subscriptions than any of its competitors, and its theme parks are once again bustling now lockdowns have been lifted.

But its boardroom is less cheery. Fewer people watch films in the cinema and cable-TV, Disney’s main source of profit, is being replaced by streaming. Plus, despite all those subscribers to its streaming service, Disney is losing more than $1bn a quarter. In November the company fired its chief executive. His replacement, [Bob Iger](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/21/disney-brings-back-a-star-of-the-past-but-its-real-problem-is-the-script), now faces a challenge from Nelson Peltz, an activist investor who wants a board seat. Mr Iger, who previously ran Disney from 2005 to 2020, has been given two years to steady the ship and find a successor. Disney’s second century is starting with a bumpy ride.

## A Modi documentary reverberates in India

In recent days India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and its leader Narendra Modi have provided a textbook example of the [Streisand effect](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2013/04/15/what-is-the-streisand-effect). That occurs when attempts to suppress something—in this case a controversial documentary—draw more attention to it. When “The Modi Question”, a BBC production, aired last week, the BJP immediately dismissed it as a “propaganda piece” for its account of the riots that killed more than 1,000 people, mainly Muslims, in Gujarat when Mr Modi was the state’s chief minister in 2002. The [Hindu nationalist party](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/07/28/indias-hindu-nationalist-ruling-party-preaches-social-inclusion) then invoked an emergency law to ban the video on the internet.

Twitter and YouTube have complied by taking down videos, but clips continue to proliferate on social-media channels. Activists and students have planned more screenings, even though some have been arrested. Media watchdogs have condemned the BJP’s heavy-handed response, which raises more questions about the commitment to democracy of the party and its leader.

## The race for the Republican Party executive

Some old-fashioned politicking is under way at the lavish waterfront Waldorf Astoria hotel in Dana Point, California. On Friday the Republican National Committee will choose its chair, who is responsible for fundraising and party messaging. For the first time since 2013, the race is contested. The incumbent of three two-year terms, Ronna McDaniel, is facing a stiff challenge from Harmeet Dhillon, a conservative lawyer.

Ms McDaniel will probably win. But the contest has emboldened her detractors. Mike Lindell, a conspiracy theory-oriented businessman who is also running, has counted the “failures” of her leadership: the 2018 midterm elections, when Republicans lost the House of Representatives; the 2020 presidential election; the [2022 midterms](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/11/09/the-democrats-have-done-better-than-expected); and two [run-off](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2021/01/09/two-stunning-victories-for-democrats-in-georgia-upend-the-senate) Senate races. Ms McDaniel’s [ties to Donald Trump](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/08/18/donald-trumps-hold-on-the-republican-party-is-unquestionable) have alienated Never-Trumpers, while more insurgent types are calling for an organisational overhaul. But at a moment when the word “Republican” frequently precedes “division”, her message—of “unity and certainty”—may prove sufficient to get her over the line.

## Fighting femicides in Spain

On Friday Spanish government officials met domestic-violence experts to discuss a worrying increase in [femicides](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2020/03/05/why-latin-america-treats-femicides-differently-from-other-murders)—murders of women because of their sex. There have been six in January, as well as the killing of an eight-year-old girl, following 11 in December. (Since records began in 2003, the annual average has been 59.) The government is reportedly considering allowing authorities to inform abused women if their partners have previous convictions for violent crimes.

The country has made strides to protect women since 2016, when a court ruled that a woman’s lack of physical resistance to the five men who raped her meant that the crime was not violent and therefore merely “sexual abuse” (the Supreme Court later [found the men](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/01/spain-acts-to-protect-women) guilty of rape). In 2020 the country recorded proportionately fewer cases of femicide than several of its neighbours, including France and Germany. And unlike other countries, Spain counts any murder of a woman by a man, where gender is deemed to have played a role, as femicide.

## The 1619 Project sparks more debate

The culture wars are coming to Hulu. In 2019, the <em>New York Times </em>magazine released a controversial set of essays that put slavery and the [black American experience](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2021/07/10/americas-history-wars) at the centre of the country’s founding and development. The 1619 Project divided opinion: it won a Pulitzer prize for commentary in 2020 while being denounced by some historians for factual inaccuracies. Several school districts, such as Chicago, embraced it as a curriculum for pupils; elsewhere whole states, such as Florida, have banned it, favouring more traditional views of American history.

Now the controversy will be streamed in a six-part series produced by Oprah Winfrey and Nikole Hannah-Jones, the project’s creator, among others. Each episode adapts an essay from the collection to show how slavery impacts the present day. So far reviews have been mixed. Some praise it as innovative; others say it falls short of some more original documentaries about the black experience.
