The <strong>Earth’s temperatures </strong>over the past eight years were the hottest on record, according to a new report presented in Egypt at the opening session of <strong>COP27</strong>, the UN’s annual climate summit. The World Meteorological Organisation also said sea levels are rising twice as fast as 30 years ago. After 48 hours of wrangling, delegates finalised the talks’ agenda. For the first time, it includes “[loss-and-damage](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/03/what-is-climate-loss-and-damage)” financing, which calls on rich countries, including those most responsible for historical emissions of greenhouse gases, to compensate poor countries for the consequences of climate change.

<strong>Apple</strong> warned that <strong>covid-19 lockdowns </strong>in China would hinder production of its newest iPhone. The firm said a [factory in Zhengzhou](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/24/the-end-of-apples-affair-with-china), where the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max are assembled, was operating at “significantly reduced capacity”. In a separate statement Foxconn, which assembles iPhones, said that its plant in Zhengzhou was introducing new covid measures. That will mean fewer shipments and longer wait times, just as the holidays approach. Chinese health officials meanwhile reported the highest caseload since May and reiterated their commitment to a [zero-covid](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/11/03/the-chinese-city-that-covid-forgot) policy.

Meanwhile <strong>China</strong>’<strong>s</strong> exports fell for the first time in two years, as the country’s businesses struggle with a global economic slowdown and the government’s zero-covid policy. Exports contracted by 0.3% year on year in October; analysts had expected growth of 4.3%. Shrinking exports will increase the strain on an [economy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/09/20/chinas-rulers-seem-resigned-to-a-slowing-economy) already hit by a property-sector slump and weak consumer demand.

<strong>Ryanair</strong>, an Irish airline, posted a post-tax <strong>profit</strong> of €1.37bn ($1.36bn) in the six months to the end of September, a record for the first half of its financial year. The airline, Europe’s biggest by passengers carried, expects demand to remain strong as customers switch from more expensive rivals. Several [airlines](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/06/09/air-travel-is-taking-flight-again) are seeing high ticket sales despite soaring inflation.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Meta</strong> is expected to announce thousands of redundancies this week, according to a report by the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. They will be the first large-scale lay-offs since Facebook was launched 18 years ago. Meanwhile <strong>Twitter</strong> has asked some sacked workers to return, after cutting half its staff last week; apparently dozens were laid off accidentally. American tech has already shed more than [45,000 jobs](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/31/what-went-wrong-with-snap-netflix-and-uber) this year.

Volodymyr Zelensky, <strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, warned that <strong>Russia</strong> was planning “mass attacks” on his country’s infrastructure. He said more than 4.5m Ukrainians are already without power. The mayor of Kyiv told residents they should make contingency plans to leave in case the capital loses power. Meanwhile Russian-installed officials in Kherson in southern Ukraine said the city had lost electricity and water because of “[sabotage](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/10/20/vladimir-putin-says-the-worlds-energy-infrastructure-is-at-risk)”.

<strong>North Korea</strong> characterised its [missile launches](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/10/18/north-korea-is-preparing-for-another-nuclear-test-or-many) of last week as a “simulated attack” against its South Korean and American enemies, and as retaliation for their joint drills. South Korean military officials said they recovered bits of a short-range ballistic weapon near its shore. And <strong>Japan’s </strong>prime minister, Kishida Fumio, promised to increase his country’s [defence capabilities](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/09/13/war-in-ukraine-has-bolstered-japans-support-for-a-stronger-army), in response to both North Korean and Russian provocations.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 180kWh a year, the amount of energy used by the average sub-Saharan African (excluding South Africa). That is less than the average American fridge.

## A complicated climate for global trade

On Monday at COP27, the [United Nations’ climate summit](https://te.arielherself.xyz/films/2022/11/04/cop27-time-for-action) held this year in Egypt, the World Trade Organisation published its annual report on global trade, the vast majority of which it oversees. Unsurprisingly, given the launch venue, the report focuses on the relationship between trade and climate change. Acknowledging that producing and transporting goods is responsible for extensive greenhouse-gas emissions, the WTO argues that trade and trade policies can also be a force for good in the fight against global warming. In particular, it urges countries to scrap tariffs and other trade barriers for environmentally-beneficial goods and technologies.

The report comes at a turbulent time. In 2021 global goods trade bounced back after a deep downturn in 2020. But over the coming year growth is expected to slow sharply; America, China and Europe are all at risk of [recessions](https://te.arielherself.xyz/recession). Protectionism is increasing. Amid rising geopolitical tensions, China and the West are trying to reduce their [interdependency](https://te.arielherself.xyz/special-report/2022/10/10/why-america-and-europe-fret-about-china-turning-inwards) for critical resources and technologies. Troubles loom on many fronts. 

## How Western weapons are helping Ukraine

In the coming days, Ukraine will receive two National Advanced Surface to Air Missile Systems developed by Kongsberg, a Norwegian aerospace company, and Raytheon, an American one. In October Ukraine received an advanced IRIS-T air-defence system from Germany, which has promised them three more. Slovakia provided a battery of missiles months ago.

Such weapons are [helping Ukraine protect itself](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/06/western-air-defence-systems-help-ukraine-shoot-down-more-missiles). On October 10th, nearly half of the missiles and drones launched by Russia dodged Ukrainian defences; now the country claims to be shooting down over 80% of the missiles and drones that come its way. The danger is still immense. Over the past month, Russian attacks have destroyed or damaged up to 40% of the country’s energy infrastructure, triggering widespread power cuts. (There are plans to evacuate Kyiv, the capital, in the event of a prolonged blackout.) America wants to increase the speed with which it hands over six additional NASAM systems. For Ukrainians, these deliveries cannot come fast enough. 

## The wide-ranging consequences of America’s midterms

Every two years Americans go to the polls to decide which congressmen and senators to hire and fire. But election day, on Tuesday, has consequences far beyond Capitol Hill. Voters also pick representatives for their state legislatures, where most policy in America is made. They elect mayors, governors and judges—and they vote on scores of local ballot measures. This year that means deciding on [abortion](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/09/22/republicans-abortion-proposal-could-backfire) and [voting rights](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/20/how-americas-midterms-could-reshape-the-courts), alongside many other issues. The [midterms](https://te.arielherself.xyz/mid-terms-2022) are an enormous democratic exercise.

But American democracy is being questioned by some Republicans. A big theme of this year’s midterms is [the rise of election deniers](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/11/01/arizonas-midterm-races-are-full-of-election-deniers), who argue that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent, and that Donald Trump is the rightful president. Many of these candidates are running for local positions, such as secretary of state, that oversee elections. Their victories in important swing states like Arizona and Michigan could affect how future elections are run. The 2024 presidential campaign is already looming. 

## Pharmaceutical firms’ uncertain post-pandemic future

BioNTech, the German [biotechnology company](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/08/10/after-a-covid-fuelled-adrenaline-rush-biotech-is-crashing) that partnered with Pfizer to produce a widely used covid-19 vaccination, released its third-quarter results on Monday. Sales fell by 43% year-on-year to €3.5bn ($3.5bn), but still beat analysts’ expectations. [Jab-makers’](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/07/13/which-covid-19-vaccine-saved-the-most-lives-in-2021) fortunes are being watched closely as the pandemic wanes. Pfizer, an American firm, performed well last week, reporting $22.6bn in third-quarter sales. Yet Moderna, another American vaccine manufacturer, fared poorly, citing complex manufacturing issues and writing off $333m of expired inventory.

Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech have increased the prices of their covid-19 products to offset anticipated slowdowns and are under pressure to diversify their drug portfolios for a post-pandemic era. BioNTech is also hoping to drive sales with its new covid booster jab, which has already proved more effective against the Omicron variant than the original version it developed with Pfizer. But as the coronavirus slips down governments’ agendas, even that might not bolster its bottom line for long.

## “Bardo” and the burdens of creation

Artistic angst pervades “Bardo: False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths”, which was released in a limited number of American cinemas by Netflix on Friday. (It will air on the streaming service in December.) The film follows a journalist-cum-filmmaker through a midlife crisis, expressed through a fugue of memories and visions. The inciting event is an awards ceremony—familiar territory for Alejandro González Iñárritu, the film’s Mexican director who has won Academy Awards for “The Revenant” and “Birdman”, among others.

Silverio Gama, the film’s fictional documentarian, finds that success does not soothe his discontent. Instead, he is haunted by ghosts from Mexico’s conquistador past and the drug wars of its present and wonders about his stature among his clubby colleagues. The film is an anxious examination of how an artist and his work are perceived, and on the pressure to seem sufficiently responsive to the concerns of the times. It joins [a recent spate of films](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/10/28/tar-official-competition-and-bardo-probe-creative-integrity) examining the challenges of creativity, notably “Blonde” and “Elvis”, two biopics about Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley respectively.
