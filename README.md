Countries are failing to meet their <strong>climate commitments</strong>, according to a report released on Wednesday ahead of <strong>COP27</strong>, the UN summit in Egypt in November. The UN’s climate body found that only 24 out of 193 countries increased their ambitions this year, despite all promising they would. If countries come good on their current pledges, the world will warm by roughly 2.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, [with disastrous consequences](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2021/03/30/what-would-different-levels-of-global-warming-look-like). Meanwhile the <em>Lancet</em>, a medical journal, found that climate change compounds health risks through hunger, heat-related illnesses and infectious disease. Heat-related deaths in people over 65 have increased by two-thirds in twenty years.

<strong>Britain’s </strong>[new government](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/10/25/rishi-sunaks-first-job-clearing-up-his-own-mess) delayed the announcement of its <strong>fiscal plan</strong>—which will have to save £40bn ($46bn)—until November 17th. Meanwhile the head of the Debt Management Office, Sir Robert Stheeman, told MPs that the turmoil in gilt markets seen after the recently-ousted government promised a raft of [ill-fated tax cuts](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically) (now reversed) was “without a shadow of doubt” caused by domestic factors—and not global tremors, as some ministers had suggested.

<strong>Russia</strong> held its first major <strong>nuclear drill</strong> since it invaded Ukraine, which simulated a retaliatory strike and was supervised by President Vladimir Putin via videolink. A day earlier America’s president, <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, warned that deploying tactical nuclear weapons would be an “incredibly serious mistake”. Separately, Ukrainian media reported that the bodies of around 1,000 people had been exhumed in territories liberated in the north-east of the country.

Gunmen killed at least 15 people and injured another 40 in an attack on a Shia shrine in Shiraz, a city in southern <strong>Iran</strong>. State media described the assailants as Sunni terrorists. Meanwhile security forces clashed with crowds honouring <strong>Mahsa Amini’s </strong>tomb in her Kurdish hometown of Saqez. Her death in police custody 40 days ago triggered [widespread and ongoing protests](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/18/irans-protests-spread-as-a-notorious-prison-burns) against Iran’s theocratic rulers. 

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

Dutch media reported that <strong>China </strong>has been running at least two undeclared “<strong>police stations</strong>” used to [muzzle Chinese dissidents](https://te.arielherself.xyz/special-report/2022/10/10/china-is-exerting-greater-power-across-asia-and-beyond) in the Netherlands. According to Safeguard Defenders, a Spanish-based NGO, the Chinese government has established 54 such overseas operations—ostensibly to offer diplomatic services, such as renewing driving licences. The Dutch foreign ministry called these centres “illegal” and promised to take “appropriate action”.

<strong>Alphabet </strong>reported lower-than-expected quarterly results. Revenues at Google’s parent company rose by 6% year over year, to $69.1bn. That is its slowest growth rate in more than two years and comes amid a pullback in digital-ad spending. Ad sales at YouTube, its video-sharing platform, declined compared with the same period in 2021. <strong>Microsoft’s</strong> revenues grew by nearly 11%, to $50bn, though sales at its [cloud-computing unit](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/08/29/the-cloud-computing-giants-are-vying-to-protect-fat-profits) slightly missed expectations.

<strong>America</strong>, <strong>Japan</strong> and <strong>South Korea</strong> warned there would be an “unparalleled scale of response” should <strong>North Korea</strong> conduct a nuclear test. Kim Jong-un’s regime last conducted a nuclear-weapons test in 2017 and the three allies worry it may now be [preparing for another](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/10/18/north-korea-is-preparing-for-another-nuclear-test-or-many). It has launched an unprecedented number of missiles this year.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>90%, roughly the share of Apple products currently made in China. [Read the full story.](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/24/the-end-of-apples-affair-with-china)

## Duplicity in the desert

The Future Investment Initiative, a talkfest for business people, investors and government leaders dubbed “Davos in the desert”, is running until Thursday in Saudi Arabia. With a theme of “Investing in Humanity: Enabling a New Global Order” and session titles like “The Humanoid Economy”, the event promises the same kind of high-sounding gibberish as its Swiss cousin. It primarily serves to add a glossy sheen to the oil-rich kingdom and help its elite network with global bosses.

America has not sent government delegates (they say they didn’t want to, while the conference’s organiser claimed they were not invited). The two countries recently had a public spat over the kingdom’s support of a [production cut by the OPEC+ oil cartel](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/10/05/opec-defies-joe-biden-with-a-big-output-cut), a move that benefits Russia, a fellow member. Still, bosses of American businesses such as JPMorgan Chase and Bridgewater have turned up, eager to cash in on the [boom under way in the Gulf](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/22/an-energy-crisis-and-geopolitics-are-creating-a-new-look-gulf). Despite its distasteful record of despotism, the kingdom’s riches continue to prove irresistible.

## Deutsche Bank still cannot find its stride

At first, it [looked like a reprieve](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/01/29/has-deutsche-bank-turned-the-corner). In April Deutsche Bank reported its highest quarterly profits in almost a decade after years spent fighting legal scandals and dumping its unwanted assets to cut losses. Yet within 48 hours police had raided the bank’s headquarters in Frankfurt in another money-laundering investigation. It has been a bumpy road in other ways, too: in July the bank ditched its cost-cutting targets, citing the “unforeseen” costs of the war in Ukraine and its litigation expenses.

On Wednesday Germany’s biggest bank reported its ninth consecutive quarter of profits. Boosted by [rising interest rates](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/09/29/global-rate-rises-are-happening-on-an-unprecedented-scale), profit before tax increased threefold from a year ago to €1.6bn ($1.6bn). But the bank also flagged another setback in a long-running IT project meant to cut costs. Investors have not been assuaged by good results, as legal troubles still hang overhead (police returned again last week in connection to a continuing tax-fraud case; the bank said it was cooperating with relevant authorities). Deutsche Bank’s share price has hovered around a quarter lower than one year ago.

## Rishi Sunak’s unflashy start as prime minister

Rishi Sunak [became Britain’s prime minister](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/10/24/rishi-sunak-is-anointed-britains-new-prime-minister) on Tuesday after an appointment with King Charles. It is shaping up to be an unflashy premiership shorn of the grand ideological visions of his predecessors. Speaking in Downing Street, Mr Sunak said that his priority would be to [restore Britain’s stability](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/10/25/rishi-sunaks-first-job-clearing-up-his-own-mess) in the face of a “profound economic crisis”. He promised to “fix” the “mistakes” of his predecessor, Liz Truss, whose mini-budget sparked a sell-off of Britain’s debt and currency. 

His cabinet is stuffed with former ministers, many keeping or returning to their previous jobs, including James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, and Suella Braverman, the home secretary. His office wants those appointments to project unity, experience and continuity. But it also reflects how—after his two predecessors were deposed in quick succession—Mr Sunak would rather not make powerful enemies by shaking things up.

## Thailand legalises abortion

As several countries [tighten access to abortions](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/06/30/around-the-world-bans-do-not-make-abortion-much-rarer), Thailand is doing the opposite: loosening its once-restrictive laws to be among the most liberal in South-East Asia. It has one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy among middle-income countries and has long waged a losing battle against [back-alley procedures](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2020/03/05/abortions-are-becoming-safer-and-easier-to-obtain-even-where-they-are-illegal). The WHO estimates that the official number of abortions, around 30,000 every year, is just a tenth of the real figure.

But in 2020 Thailand’s constitutional court ruled that banning abortion violated equal rights for men and women as well as the rights to life and liberty. Last year, as a first step, the government legalised procedures performed during the first trimester of pregnancy. From Thursday women who are no more than 20 weeks into their pregnancies will be able to seek abortions in 110 public hospitals and clinics across the country, after consultation with a doctor.

## The art of climate protest

On Sunday climate activists glued themselves to the “Abbey Road” crossing in London, made famous by the Beatles; on Monday four more were arrested for smearing cake on a waxwork of King Charles III at Madame Tussauds. The group, “Just Stop Oil”, is increasingly using cultural targets to [protest against climate change](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2021/11/17/what-is-the-35-rule-beloved-of-climate-protesters).

Their stunts—which also included splattering soup over Van Gogh’s “Sunflowers” at Britain’s National Gallery—have sparked furious debate about whether they engage or alienate the public. Polling published in April found that whereas 58% of respondents supported the group’s demands, including stopping new licences being issued for fossil-fuel projects in Britain, only 18% supported the group itself. Messing with artwork inconveniences the public less directly than its more conventional past activity, such as blocking roads, but also feels more tangential to climate issues. Undeterred, the group has warned to expect them “every day and anywhere”.
