<strong>China’s population</strong> fell in 2022 for the first time since 1961, when the country was in the throes of Mao’s great famine. Official statistics showed the population dropped by 850,000 last year, compared with 2021, to 1.4118bn. That may mean China has already lost its position as the world’s most populous country to India, a change that had not been expected until [later this year](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/14/india-will-become-the-worlds-most-populous-country-in-2023). The shift will fuel fears of a demographic crisis, with too few young Chinese to support an ageing population.

[<strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/10/18/goldman-sachss-disastrous-main-street-gamble) reported a fall in fourth-quarter profits. Net income came to $1.3bn, down from $3.9bn in the previous year. The bank began a series of job cuts this month. <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> also reported a drop in fourth-quarter profits, although this was smaller than expected, at 41%.

[<strong>Oleksiy Arestovych</strong>](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/04/25/an-interview-with-oleksiy-arestovych-military-adviser-to-ukraines-presidency), a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser, resigned. Mr Arestovych apologised for comments he made suggesting that the <strong>Russian missile </strong>which hit an apartment building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Saturday had been struck down by Ukrainian air defences. Ukrainian officials say that the building was hit by a Russian Kh-22 missile, which their defences are not capable of shooting down. 

[<strong>Nguyen Xuan Phuc</strong>](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2021/02/04/the-surprising-choice-to-lead-vietnams-communist-party), the president of<strong> Vietnam</strong>, resigned. The ruling Communist Party accused him of being responsible for “wrongdoings” committed by senior ministers who worked for him before he became president. He is the latest in a series of officials to leave office in an anti-corruption crackdown orchestrated by the government. In 2022, 539 party members were prosecuted for corruption.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>China</strong> missed its <strong>GDP</strong> target for 2022, with the economy growing by just 3% over the year. It is its poorest showing for nearly half a century, save for pandemic-hit 2020. It had hoped for a 5.5% expansion, itself a modest ambition compared with the recent past. The economy was [whacked](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/12/20/chinas-leaders-ponder-an-economy-without-lockdowns-or-crackdowns) by strict covid-containment policies, which included locking down entire cities, sometimes for months.

<strong>The British government</strong> has formally blocked a controversial Scottish [<strong>transgender law</strong>](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2023/01/05/scotlands-new-gender-reform-law-presents-rishi-sunak-with-a-dilemma) designed to streamline the process for people in Scotland to change their legal gender. It is the first time the Westminster parliament has overruled legislation passed by the devolved Scottish parliament. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, called the move a “full-frontal attack on our democratically elected Scottish parliament”.

<strong>Xpeng</strong>, a Chinese <strong>electric vehicle</strong> manufacturer, lowered the price of some of its models by up to 12.5% for the domestic market. The move comes after two competitors, Tesla and Seres, cut prices earlier this month. China churns out [more electric vehicles](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/10/13/chinese-marques-try-to-make-inroads-into-western-markets) than any other country, but Chinese EV makers may struggle to maintain sales as demand in the country is forecast to fall in the coming months.

## Belarusian democracy on trial

On Tuesday a show trial of [Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya](https://te.arielherself.xyz/by-invitation/2022/04/02/sviatlana-tsikhanouskaya-argues-that-europe-will-be-safer-if-belarus-is-free) and four other democracy activists begins in Belarus. But Ms Tskihanouskaya—the leader of the country’s opposition who challenged its president of 28 years, Alexander Lukashenko, in [sham elections](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2020/08/13/belaruss-election-was-a-sham-the-wests-response-has-been-feeble) in 2020—will not be present. She fled the country soon after the polls and has been on the run ever since. This week she is in Davos, at the World Economic Forum, to speak about economic revival in a democratic Belarus.

Concern over Belarus’s domestic repression has been largely superseded by condemnation of its support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But that repression has escalated since the election. Hundreds of civil-society groups have been closed down. Some 1,500 dissenters have been locked away. Earlier in January Ales Bialiatski, a human-rights activist and winner of the [Nobel Peace Prize](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/10/07/the-nobel-peace-prize-recognises-human-rights-groups-that-spoke-truth-to-putinism), was tried in Minsk, the capital, on charges of financing protests. Ms Tsikhanouskaya’s own litany of sins supposedly includes treason and rioting. She has called her trial in absentia a “disgrace”. She will probably be found guilty.

## Britain’s tight labour market

Britain’s inflation figures for December, published on Wednesday, will probably show that price pressures are easing, partly due to declining energy prices. Perhaps more important for the Bank of England’s future decisions on [interest rates](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/12/08/rising-interest-rates-and-inflation-have-upended-investing), however, will be the labour market figures for the three months to November, published on Tuesday. 

Despite a slowing economy, there is little sign of rising unemployment in Britain. Such a tight labour market worries the bank. A specific concern is rising levels of economic inactivity: a large number of workers left the labour market during the pandemic, [mainly older ones](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/10/27/where-did-all-britains-50-somethings-go). To lure them back Britain’s Treasury reportedly even considered offering tax breaks to the over 50s to make the office look a bit more attractive than early retirement. An increase in the number of workers seeking jobs would be a far less painful way to create some labour market slack than using higher interest rates to dampen demand.

## Two inquiries into a South Korean tragedy close

South Korea’s parliamentary probe into the [events](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/11/03/when-a-disaster-shakes-a-country-political-leaders-face-peril) of October 29th 2022, when 159 people were killed in a crush in Seoul, wrapped up on Tuesday. That night Halloween revellers packed into the narrow alleyways of Itaewon, a popular partying destination, until the sheer mass of bodies turned deadly. A separate police inquiry that concluded on January 13th referred 23 people for prosecution, but blamed only local functionaries, absolving the government despite a feeling that it should take responsibility. The parliamentary probe came to a different conclusion: it found Lee Sang-min, the interior minister, at fault.

It is unlikely to bring solace to the victims’ families. The parliamentary investigation was constantly sidetracked and delayed by politicking, self-serving recriminations and testy exchanges. It ended in a similar fashion, with members of Mr Lee’s party contesting the conclusion. The families of the victims, and the public, will probably continue to push for answers.

## Elon Musk’s tweeting on trial

Long before his $44bn impulse-bid for Twitter, Elon Musk was paying for his [intemperate use of the social-media platform](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/12/19/elon-musks-44bn-education-on-free-speech). One tweet in particular has cost him dearly: “Am considering taking Tesla private at $420 [a share]. Funding secured,” wrote Mr Musk, falsely, in August 2018. The share price of his electric-car company, well below that level at the time, duly soared. But no such deal was remotely at hand. America’s Securities and Exchange Commission promptly sued him for fraud, which Mr Musk settled, incurring a $20m penalty. On Tuesday a separate securities-fraud lawsuit goes to trial in San Francisco. The Tesla investors bringing the case to court allege that Mr Musk’s reckless statement cost them billions of dollars. Mr Musk denies the charge.

Ironically, in surveys, people say firms whose bosses use social media are much more trustworthy than those who avoid it. Mr Musk seems to be an exception. The SEC now requires that all his Tesla-related tweets be vetted by a lawyer for the firm—the so-called “Twitter sitter”.

## A musical pioneer reckons with mortality

Ryuichi Sakamoto, a Japanese composer, releases “12” on Tuesday, his 71st birthday. He penned the album’s dozen musical sketches as he recovered from his second battle with cancer.

The album seems a distant, stripped-down relative of the jaunty synth-pop that Mr Sakamoto produced as part of Yellow Magic Orchestra, a [pioneering electronic-music](https://te.arielherself.xyz/1843/2019/04/18/make-brexit-bearablewith-japanese-ambient-music) outfit. (Yukihiro Takahashi, another member of the group, died last week.) Dark synthesiser drones pair with wandering piano solos. Sparse chords ring out and are left to fade unaccompanied—a seeming meditation on mortality, and on what persists and what must decay. The tracks’ titles are simply the dates they were composed, the exception being a mid-album <em>sarabande</em>, or triple-metre dance.

This intimate, unnerving sound-diary hints at the composer’s evolving moods and physical condition. His frail, laboured breathing can often be heard clearly; so, too, can birdsong. These imperfections, Mr Sakamoto says, were left intentionally on the recordings, reminders that even as breaths grow short, life dutifully carries on.
