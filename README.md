<strong>China</strong> began suppressing the widespread <strong>protests</strong> that erupted over the weekend in frustration at the government’s [stringent anti-covid measures](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/11/27/unrest-breaks-out-across-china-as-frustration-at-lockdowns-grows). Legions of police were deployed in Beijing and Shanghai, and an unknown number of protesters were arrested. Asian stockmarkets showed signs of rallying after the protests initially caused a slump at the [prospect of slower growth](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/28/chinas-economy-cannot-bear-much-more-zero-covid) in China. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose by 5.2%, while China’s CSI 300 grew by 3.1%. 

Leaders in Congress promised to block a <strong>railway strike</strong>. On Wednesday <strong>America’s</strong> House of Representatives will vote to force unions to accept a new contract and end their [stand-off with rail carriers](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/09/15/america-has-averted-a-rail-strike-but-the-industry-is-far-off-track), said Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House. Four unions had rejected the deal, saying it does not meet their demands for better pay and sick leave, and threatened to strike.

<strong>America</strong> committed $53m to repair <strong>Ukrainian</strong> [energy infrastructure](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/23/in-ukraine-living-as-normal-is-an-act-of-defiance) destroyed by Russian missiles. Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, announced the aid package while foreign ministers from NATO countries gathered in Romania to discuss how to assist Ukraine as winter sets in. The alliance reiterated its support for Ukrainian membership, but with the country’s borders still unclear, NATO has outlined no accession timeline.

<strong>Britain </strong>agreed to buy out a <strong>Chinese </strong>state-owned firm of its 20% stake in a nuclear station in England, a day after its prime minister said maintaining [close ties with China](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/07/28/chinese-investment-in-britain-is-under-the-microscope) had been “naive”. Instead Britain will seek other investors in the Sizewell C power station. Separately, Britain summoned the Chinese ambassador to criticise the treatment of a BBC journalist who was arrested while covering Shanghai’s protests.

<strong>Singapore’s</strong> parliament decriminalised sex between men, though it also moved to block potential future legislation on legalising same-sex marriage. Despite that disappointment, LGBT activists hailed the news that the [colonial-era ban](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/03/05/singapores-high-court-retains-an-anti-gay-law) was officially repealed. Singaporean attitudes toward LGBT rights have liberalised significantly in recent years, especially among the young.

<strong>Maria Kolesnikova</strong>, a Belarusian opposition activist serving 11 years in jail, was taken to an intensive care unit, according to the Telegram account of Viktor Babariko, a jailed opposition politician. Ms Kolesnikova had previously been placed in solitary confinement. She was arrested in 2020 as one of the leaders of the unrest that [swept Belarus](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2020/08/13/belaruss-election-was-a-sham-the-wests-response-has-been-feeble) in protest against Alexander Lukashenko’s almost-30-year rule as president.

<strong>Football World Cup: America</strong> beat <strong>Iran</strong> 1-0. The goal, by Christian Pulisic, sent him to hospital with an injury. <strong>England</strong> beat<strong> Wales</strong> 3-0. The run-up to the former match was dominated by the anti-government protests in Iran, which America has supported. On Monday a protester interrupted a match wearing a T-shirt that said “[Respect For Iranian Women](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/12/despite-lethal-repression-irans-protests-continue)”.

## What’s behind the selection of Pakistan’s new army chief

Pakistan’s army has long been regarded as wielding more political influence than the country’s hapless politicians. But the appointment of Syed Asim Munir, who takes over from Qamar Javed Bajwa as the chief of the army on Tuesday, looks at least partly driven by party politics. General Munir’s tenure as head of Pakistan’s spy agency was cut short in 2019 after he fell out with [Imran Khan](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/11/03/imran-khan-pakistans-ex-prime-minister-survives-an-attempt-on-his-life), then the prime minister. Mr Khan was himself ousted by Parliament in April and has since set about trying to undermine the government of Shehbaz Sharif, his successor.

Mr Sharif seems to have appointed Mr Munir partly because he sees him as a counterweight to Mr Khan. Yet the army’s reputation among voters has been damaged by Mr Khan’s unproven allegation that military leaders conspired with America to remove him from power. Many soldiers in the army’s lower ranks are quiet supporters of the former prime minister. The new chief will have to work hard to regain the confidence of ordinary soldiers and other Pakistanis. 

## Why the world faces more water stress

On Tuesday the World Meteorological Organisation published, for the first time, an evaluation of global water resources. The findings are bleak: much of the world experienced unusually dry conditions in 2021. Although this was partly due to [La Niña](https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/the-weather-system-that-influences-the-world)—a temporary weather pattern that influences the distribution of rains and winds—it is mostly a result of [climate change](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/11/20/a-new-un-fund-for-loss-and-damage-emerges-from-cop27), which is driving up temperatures and worsening droughts. These changes affect economies: in Britain and Europe alone, droughts currently cause around $9bn in losses each year.

There is a growing awareness of the relationship between water availability and climate change. According to the UN, by 2050 1.6bn people will be at risk of floods (up from 1.2bn currently), while 3.2bn may live in water-scarce areas (up from 1.9bn in 2010). To help them cope, the WMO says a more sophisticated understanding of where the world’s water is stored (and how that is changing) will be needed. Data from some countries are currently barely available.   


## Emmanuel Macron goes to Washington

The [French president will arrive](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/11/24/on-a-visit-to-america-frances-president-will-confront-new-problems) in Washington, DC on Tuesday evening for his second state visit to America (he was hosted by Donald Trump in 2018) and the first full state visit that President Joe Biden has hosted. Expect much celebration of America and France’s long friendship—both countries like to say they are each other’s oldest ally. Emmanuel Macron will be treated to the works, including a state banquet at the White House.

The war in Ukraine and geopolitical shifts mean that there will be tensions to manage, too. The French and American positions on Russia have converged: both countries firmly support Ukraine while also seeking to avoid escalation and ultimately favouring a diplomatic solution to the conflict. The thorniest immediate issue will be [America’s massive subsidies](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/10/27/joe-biden-attempts-the-biggest-overhaul-of-americas-economy-in-decades) for clean energy and semiconductors. Europe, France included, considers these a breach of international-trade rules and fears for its own industries, battered by soaring energy prices. New problems will test even the oldest of allies.

## America’s army recruitment woes

For the fiscal year ending September 2022, America’s army fell 15,000 short of its goal of 60,000 new recruits. On Tuesday grandees—including Major General Johnny Davis, who oversees recruitment—will discuss the problem at the Heritage Foundation, a think-tank in Washington. What explains the shortfall? A red-hot job market has increased competition for workers. And the pandemic saw higher obesity rates and worse academic performance, shrinking the pool of eligible recruits.  


Fewer want to sign up, anyway. The army says that just 9% of eligible candidates are actually interested in joining, the lowest level for 15 years. America’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan is partly to blame. So is political polarisation: many on the left see America’s army as stuffy and outdated; those on the right accuse it of being too woke. The army is now stepping up outreach in schools and universities and offering bigger signing bonuses. If that fails to do the trick, some reservists may be put on active duty.

## America and Iran meet on the football field

America and Iran have had no diplomatic relations since 1980. Representatives of the two countries almost never come face-to-face, in any arena. But on Tuesday their football teams will face off at the [World Cup in Qatar](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/11/17/the-qatar-world-cup-shows-how-football-is-changing). To stay in the tournament America must win; Iran needs at least a draw. At their previous (and only) World Cup fixture, in 1998, Iran took the honours 2-1.

The match follows months of [anti-government demonstrations in Iran](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/24/while-irans-turmoil-persists-jitters-spread-through-the-region), which America has supported. Before their first game in Qatar, the Iranian squad appeared to stage a protest by standing silent during their national anthem. At the second the players did sing, but many Iranians think they were coerced. And last weekend America’s football federation posted a version of Iran’s flag on social media, minus the logo of the Islamic Republic (it was later deleted). Neither side is likely to acknowledge it publicly, but the resonance of Tuesday’s game will extend far beyond the stadium in Doha.
