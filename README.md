A judge released parts of a grand-jury report assessing <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> [interference](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/05/how-much-legal-jeopardy-is-donald-trump-in) in the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. It is not yet clear whether there will be any indictments, but jurors believe that some witnesses may have committed perjury. They concluded that widespread electoral fraud did not take place in the state, and that the result should not be overturned, despite the former president’s claims to the contrary.

Volodymyr Zelensky, <strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, told the BBC that he would not concede land to Russia if the countries were to broker a peace deal. Earlier, Alexander Lukashenko, the president of <strong>Belarus </strong>and an [ally](https://te.arielherself.xyz/by-invitation/2022/04/02/sviatlana-tsikhanouskaya-argues-that-europe-will-be-safer-if-belarus-is-free) of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, said that he would only join Russia’s invasion of Ukraine if attacked first. The two leaders will meet near Moscow on Friday. 

<strong>YouTube’s </strong>chief executive, Susan Wojcicki, is stepping down after leading the video platform since 2014. Ms Wojcicki was an early employee of Google, which owns YouTube, and helped build its online-advertising business. Her departure comes as YouTube faces slowing revenue growth and the ever-tricky challenge of [policing](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2019/05/04/the-tricky-task-of-policing-youtube) content. Neal Mohan, YouTube’s chief product officer, will head the firm. 

<strong>Tesla</strong> said it would issue an over-the-air software update to 362,800 cars equipped withs its driver-assistance [software](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2023/01/04/investors-conclude-that-tesla-is-a-carmaker-not-a-tech-firm), which is marketed as Full Self-Driving Beta. America’s auto-safety regulator reportedly pressed for the recall—which, in this case, can be implemented remotely—and said that cars with the feature have been known to violate local traffic laws. Tesla’s share price shed nearly 6%.

<strong>Jes Staley</strong>, the former boss of Barclays, exchanged more than a thousand emails, including photos of young women, with <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> while he worked at JPMorgan as the late financier’s private banker. The trove was revealed in a court filing by the US Virgin Islands, where Epstein owned a home, as part of its suit against JPMorgan for allegedly [facilitating Epstein’s sexual predation](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2019/07/13/was-jeffrey-epsteins-plea-deal-fishy). The bank has denied those claims. Mr Staley is not a defendant in the suit.

Amid rising diplomatic tensions<strong> China</strong> put two <strong>American</strong> defence contractors, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies, on its “unreliable entities list” after they sold arms to <strong>Taiwan</strong>. Last February the companies faced sanctions for selling arms worth $100m to the island. China claims Taiwan as its own, but America supports its right to [self-govern](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2023/01/26/does-chinas-softer-tone-extend-to-taiwan).

<strong>Centrica</strong>, the owner of British gas, reported record profits of £3.3bn ($4bn), triple its earnings in the previous year, after energy prices rose across Europe. Its customer base grew by 4%. But the success of Britain’s largest energy provider comes as the country grapples with a [cost-of-living](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/04/21/a-guide-to-britains-cost-of-living-crunch) crunch, and follows accusations of the company force-fitting prepayment metres in the homes of vulnerable customers.

## Scottish independence after Sturgeon

Three weeks ago Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, said she did not feel “anywhere near” stepping down. On Wednesday, she resigned, citing the heavy toll the job has taken on her personal life. This leaves Scotland’s independence movement at a crossroads. 

The Scottish National Party, to which she belongs, has been in power in Scotland since 2007, and champions the country leaving the United Kingdom. Ms Sturgeon took over as leader in 2014, shortly after a referendum in which Scottish voters rejected independence. Since then there has been stalemate. Britain’s government has refused permission for another referendum and last year the Supreme Court ruled that Scotland’s devolved government lacked the authority to organise its own.

Ms Sturgeon will remain first minister until a replacement is found. In March SNP members will vote on whether to treat the next general election, due by January 2025, as a de facto referendum. A decision to do so would be a gamble. Voters are roughly split on independence and more than two thirds of Scots oppose a proxy referendum. But the SNP’s most immediate problem is the departure of a charismatic and canny leader with no clear successor.

## Wang Yi’s European tour

On Thursday China’s most senior diplomat, Wang Yi, will be in Italy to meet the country’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. It will be Mr Wang’s third day of a European tour that has already taken him to France and is expected to include stops at the EU in Brussels, as well as Germany, Hungary and Russia. 

The trip comes amid a row over [Chinese surveillance balloons](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2023/02/09/tensions-will-linger-over-a-chinese-balloon-downed-by-america), one of which was shot down by America over the Atlantic on February 4th. The balloon’s incursion into American airspace caused America’s secretary of state, Antony Blinken, to [cancel](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2023/02/03/how-a-balloon-burst-sino-american-talks) a visit to Beijing that was planned for last week. In Germany Mr Wang is expected to attend the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of security and military bigwigs which begins on Friday. A rumoured meeting there with Mr Blinken would aim to lower tensions. But Mr Wang’s visit to Russia, days before the anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine, highlights another sore spot in China’s relations with the West: its tacit support for Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked aggression.

## Will Paramount’s reboot succeed?

“Unscripted”, a book published this week, chronicles the dysfunctional final years of Sumner Redstone, a nonagenarian billionaire, and his family atop the sprawling media empire he founded. (Redstone died in 2020.) Paramount Global, that conglomerate, which includes CBS, MTV, Paramount Pictures, Showtime and Simon &amp; Schuster, is now run by his daughter, [Shari Redstone](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2016/08/25/in-the-name-of-the-father). On Thursday the company reported mixed quarterly results—with strong subscriber growth but weak advertising revenue—sending shares down in morning trading.

But there is still optimism around Ms Redstone’s stewardship. Paramount+, its streaming service, has garnered some 55m subscribers in under two years. [“Top Gun: Maverick”](https://te.arielherself.xyz/culture/2022/05/26/top-gun-maverick-feels-the-need-to-speed-into-the-past), an action reboot starring Tom Cruise and produced by Paramount Pictures, was a hit last year. A new buyer is being sought for Simon &amp; Schuster, a book publisher, after a proposed merger with Penguin Random House was blocked on competition grounds. Investors will be hoping for more signs of a successful reboot.

## Arresting Hong Kong’s decline

“Will the last person to leave…turn out the lights.” So ran a famous <em>Sun</em> headline at the prospect of people fleeing dysfunctional Britain. In tropical Hong Kong they’ll have to remember to switch off the air conditioner too. On Thursday the territory reported a population decline in 2022 of 68,300—around 1% of its people—the third straight year it has fallen. 

A low birth rate doesn’t help. But mostly people were fleeing recession and suffocating covid-containment measures. And it is no coincidence the exodus began in 2020, when China “gifted” Hong Kong a swingeing [national-security law](https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/essay/2022/07/01/how-hong-kong-became-a-police-state). 

Hong Kong’s chief executive, [John Lee](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/04/09/john-lee-a-tough-former-policeman-looks-set-to-lead-hong-kong), knows he has a problem. He remains committed to [suppressing freedoms](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2023/02/09/hong-kong-starts-its-largest-national-security-trial), but he has launched a scheme allowing international high-flyers to relocate to the city without needing a job offer. Thousands of new homes are planned to help reduce eye-watering property costs. And many covid restrictions have finally been lifted. It may not be enough.

## Berlin’s International Film Festival

The 73rd Berlinale film festival begins in the German capital on Thursday. Of the nearly 300 festival films, 19 will vie to win Golden and Silver Bears. Contenders include “Le Grand Chariot” (“The Plough”), by Philippe Garrel, a French director, which tells the story of three generations of puppeteers, a dying profession. In “BlackBerry” Matt Johnson, a young Canadian director, dramatises the rise and fall of the pioneering smartphone-maker. 

But the festival’s reputation is for political art. Thus, “Superpower”, a documentary about Ukraine’s president, [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://te.arielherself.xyz/ukraines-fateful-winter), will have its world premiere at the festival on Friday. Its American directors, Sean Penn and Aaron Kaufman, began the film long before the invasion, intending to document Mr Zelensky’s journey from stand-up comic to head of state. But they were in Kyiv on February 24th 2022 when the Russian army crossed the border, and captured Mr Zelensky’s overnight transformation from besuited politician to combat-fatigue-wearing war hero.
