<strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, Volodymyr Zelensky, thumbed his nose at Russia by addressing the “leaders of the G19” at the G20 summit in Indonesia. In a video address Mr Zelensky called for <strong>Russia’s</strong> “aggressive” war against his country to “end justly”. A draft resolution is circulating at the conference, which [opened on Tuesday](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/11/13/the-dynamics-of-distrust-around-the-g20-summit), stating that “most members strongly condemn” the war in Ukraine. Russia says “politicisation” of the summit is unfair.

President<strong> Joe Biden</strong> rejected the idea of a “new cold war” with China and said he believed Taiwan faced no “imminent” threat of invasion. The remarks came after a three-hour meeting with his Chinese counterpart, <strong>Xi Jinping</strong> ahead of the [G20 summit](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/11/13/the-dynamics-of-distrust-around-the-g20-summit). Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, will visit Beijing early next year to follow up on the talks.

G20 countries announced a $20bn fund to help <strong>Indonesia</strong> use less <strong>coal</strong>. In return, [Indonesia](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/11/14/indonesia-is-poised-for-a-boom-politics-permitting) promised that its power-sector CO2 emissions will peak at 290m tonnes by 2030, seven years earlier than previously forecast. The package of grants and concessional loans, from public and private sources, is modelled on an $8.5bn deal struck with [South Africa](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/01/22/south-africa-the-worlds-coal-junkie-tries-to-quit) last year.

[Another](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/10/after-the-midterms-america-and-its-democracy-look-stronger) Donald Trump-endorsed election-denier fell to defeat in <strong>America’s midterm elections</strong>, as Katie Hobbs beat Kari Lake, the Republican candidate, to become the first Democratic governor of <strong>Arizona </strong>since 2006. Republicans did, however, hold on to two congressional seats in California and one in New York, putting them one win away from wresting control of the House of Representatives from the Democrats.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

Federal prosecutors in New York opened an investigation into the collapse of <strong>FTX</strong>, after the crypto exchange [filed for bankruptcy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/11/sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-exchange-files-for-bankruptcy) amid a rush of customer withdrawals. The probe will examine whether FTX lent customers’ money to Alameda Research, a crypto trading company also owned by <strong>[Sam Bankman-Fried](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/11/09/the-spectacular-fall-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried)</strong>. Two of America’s regulators, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, have already launched similar investigations.

<strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>, Warren Buffett’s investment firm, revealed it took an estimated $4bn-5bn stake in <strong>TSMC</strong>, a Taiwanese chipmaker, in the third quarter. The purchase is further proof that Mr Buffett, who once made a habit of passing on tech shares, is shifting his view. (Berkshire’s largest investment—$126.5bn—is now in Apple.) TSMC’s share price, on [a year-long decline](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/09/29/why-some-chipmakers-are-hurting-much-more-than-others), rose by 9% on the news.

<strong>Amazon </strong>will lay off around 10,000 employees in its technology, human-resources and retail divisions, according to the <em>New York Times</em>. The redundancies, slated to begin this week, represent 3% of the e-commerce giant’s workforce and the largest such cut in its history. It follows similar moves by [Meta](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/11/07/meta-will-lay-off-13-of-its-workforce), Twitter and Lyft, as America’s<strong> big-tech</strong> industry grapples with the possibility of a looming recession.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 10.4bn, the size at which the global population is expected to peak, sometime between 2080 and 2100. [Read the full story.](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/11/11/the-worlds-population-has-reached-8bn-dont-panic)

## Donald Trump (probably) runs again

“I will very, very, very probably do it again,” said Donald Trump this month at a rally in Sioux City, Iowa. On Tuesday Mr Trump will make his intention to run for president in 2024 official. At least, very, very, very probably.

America’s former president may be motivated by more than politics. Returning to the White House could protect him from some of the [legal cases](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/10/05/how-much-legal-jeopardy-is-donald-trump-in) that are mounting against him. Originally he wanted to announce his bid on the eve of the midterms, but Republican leaders talked him down. Given the underwhelming performance of Trump-endorsed candidates, advisers have reportedly encouraged him to delay again.  
  
 Mr Trump may see an advantage in entering the field ahead of [Ron DeSantis](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/11/10/ron-desantis-and-other-winners), the governor of Florida, and Mike Pence, his former vice-president. Boosted by the Democrats’ [better than expected](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/11/13/the-democrats-keep-control-of-the-senate) results, President Joe Biden wants [another run](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/14/donald-trump-and-joe-biden-both-want-to-run-again), too. A contest between Mr Biden and Mr Trump would be a grudge match almost nobody wants.

## Jokowi plays statesman at the G20

Its Indonesian host, [President Joko Widodo](https://te.arielherself.xyz/jokowi-interview), calls this G20 summit, which began on Tuesday, the “most difficult” yet. Motivated by domestic issues, Jokowi (as he is known) has rarely cared for the global stage. But dialogue is his new mantra.

Jokowi tried hard to get Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, and Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, to join him at the luxury hotel in Bali. Mr Putin stayed away, but Mr Zelensky spoke by video to what he pointedly called, to exclude Russia, the “G19”. A leaked draft of a statement agreed by G20 diplomats condemned Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, and the economic dislocation it has caused, in stronger terms than many in the West expected. 

Elsewhere, little progress is expected around issues of global governance. And despite Jokowi’s efforts to create a genial atmosphere, the worsening relationship between [China and America](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/11/13/the-dynamics-of-distrust-around-the-g20-summit) is the elephant in the ballroom. A meeting between their presidents, Xi Jinping and Joe Biden, on Monday, was reassuring. But their list of gripes is extensive.

## The world’s eight billionth person

On Tuesday the world reaches a [milestone](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/11/11/the-worlds-population-has-reached-8bn-dont-panic). The global population, according to UN projections, will reach 8bn. Twelve years have passed since the world passed the [7bn milestone](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2011/10/22/now-we-are-seven-billion), and 6bn was passed 12 years before that. 

The rate of growth has fallen. This year the population is forecast to have risen by just 0.8%, the slowest rate since the 1950s and a third of the peak in 1963. Women are choosing to have fewer children and between now and 2050, the UN thinks, 61 countries will see their populations fall by at least 1%.

The global population is like a train: slam the brakes on and it stops, but only eventually. According to the UN, it will take 15 years to add the next billion people, and 21 years to reach the billion after that. The world is coming to an inflection point: the momentum of growth that has prevailed since the 1950s is being replaced by stability and stasis.

## Binyamin Netanyahu’s path to power

On Tuesday the 120 politicians elected on [November 1st](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/02/netanyahu-seems-on-track-to-be-israels-next-prime-minister) as members of Israel’s parliament will meet for the first time in Jerusalem. For now Binyamin Netanyahu, a former prime minister, is still the leader of the opposition.  
  
 Mr Netanyahu has been endorsed by a majority of the Knesset’s incoming members. On Sunday he received a mandate from Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, to form a new government. But his route back to the prime minister’s office is not simple. First he must sign coalition agreements with the assortment of [far-right](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2022/11/03/who-is-itamar-ben-gvir-israels-kingmaker) and religious parties who comprise his majority. They have a long list of [demands](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/10/the-changing-nature-of-israeli-politics), including legislation that would weaken the Supreme Court and funding for Jewish schools. Hardliners also want to control important ministries including defence, public security, education and finance. Many Israelis would [balk](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/11/10/israels-centrists-should-back-binyamin-netanyahu) at that. Having fought so hard to win a majority, Mr Netanyahu may struggle to control it.

## Walmart rides the inflation rollercoaster

On Tuesday Walmart is due to report its latest quarterly results. The American supermarket giant spooked investors earlier this year with a series of profit warnings as rising fuel and food prices led consumers to cut back spending on other items. That forced Walmart to sell excess stock at a discount, crimping its margins. Markets sensed a bad omen for the wider economy.

Since then the firm has staged a robust recovery. Its share price is back where it was in January, despite the falling stockmarket. Inflation in America is coming down, easing pressure on customers’ wallets, but remains high enough that wealthier shoppers are still turning to Walmart for bargains. The Beast of Bentonville is also [toughening up with suppliers](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2021/11/20/walmart-gets-its-bite-back) and pushing back on price rises. A good quarter for Walmart, in other words, does not necessarily mean a good quarter for everyone else.
