<strong>President Joe Biden</strong> announced a plan for significant <strong>student-debt relief</strong>, under which up to $10,000 in [student loans](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2020/02/20/how-the-next-president-should-fix-americas-student-loan-problem) will be forgiven for each debtor who earns less than $125,000 a year. Even greater boons will go to those who received federal aid during their education. The announcement follows months of [political wrangling](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/04/16/why-america-keeps-delaying-student-loan-repayments). Senate Republicans accused Mr Biden of “passing the buck to working-class Americans”. Many economists fret that debt cancellation can aggravate inflation.

A <strong>Russian</strong> rocket strike on a railway station in eastern <strong>Ukraine</strong> killed at least 22 people on Wednesday—the country’s independence day—according to Ukrainian officials. Heavy shelling was reported in other parts of the country. The day also marked the [six-month anniversary](https://te.arielherself.xyz/interactive/europe/2022/08/24/six-months-of-war-in-ukraine) of Russia’s [invasion](https://te.arielherself.xyz/ukraine-crisis). Separately America announced a further $3bn in military assistance to Ukraine.

<strong>Taiwan’s </strong>government proposed putting more than $19bn towards its <strong>defence budget </strong>next year, which would represent almost a 15% increase on current spending. Earlier this month <strong>China </strong>staged its [largest-ever military exercises](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/08/04/china-sends-missiles-flying-over-taiwan) around (and sometimes within) territory Taiwan claims for itself, following a visit paid to the island by Nancy Pelosi, one of America’s most senior legislators.

<strong>China</strong> announced an additional 300bn yuan ($44bn) for policy banks to lend to infrastructure, to help counter an [alarming economic slowdown](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/08/18/chinas-economy-is-beset-by-problems). The money comes on top of a similar amount announced in June. China’s cabinet also confirmed that local governments could issue an extra 500bn yuan of “special” bonds, to be repaid with the help of revenues earned from the projects they finance.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Amazon</strong> said it would shut the virtual <strong>health service</strong> it offers to its employees, bringing to an end—for now at least—an attempt to upend [America’s health-care market](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2018/02/03/apple-and-amazons-moves-in-health-signal-a-coming-transformation). The e-retailer said that Amazon Care was not extensive enough to offer to other companies. Staff have round-the-clock video access to doctors and nurses, and also to a few physical sites in order to receive vaccinations, testing and the like.

<strong>California</strong> is expected to [ban](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/california-wants-to-lead-the-world-on-climate-policy/21808833) the sale of petrol-powered cars, in a move that could accelerate the transition to <strong>electric vehicles</strong>. The California Air Resources Board said that 100% of cars sold in the state, America’s largest auto market, will have to be zero-emissions by 2035, up from 12% today. Last week Joe Biden signed a [new climate law](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/08/08/americas-climate-plus-spending-bill-is-flawed-but-essential) that earmarks $370bn for green energy projects.

Fighting erupted in northern <strong>Ethiopia </strong>between rebels from the <strong>Tigray region</strong> and central government forces, ending a five-month long ceasefire and dampening hopes for peace talks in the country’s ongoing [civil war](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/04/13/ethnic-cleansing-of-tigrayans-may-prolong-ethiopias-civil-war). The conflict between the Tigray People’s Liberation Front, which controls the region, and prime minister Abiy Ahmed’s government has killed thousands and displaced millions since it began in 2020. 

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>$15bn, the value of direct investment foreigners pulled out of Russia in the first quarter of 2022, easily the worst figure on record.

## Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago headache

Donald Trump decried the [FBI raid on his Mar-a-Lago home](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/08/10/the-raid-on-mar-a-lago-could-shake-americas-foundations) on August 8th as an unjustified political assault. The bureau has so far been tight-lipped on its motivations. But its rationale for the seizure of classified records from Mr Trump’s Palm Beach estate may soon be divulged. A judge in Florida, Bruce Reinhart, could rule as soon as Thursday on whether to unseal a redacted version of the Justice Department’s affidavit that enabled the search.

Mr Trump has demanded the unsealing of the full document. But his lawyers filed no such motion in court. Government officials warn that releasing the unredacted affidavit could sabotage their [probe into the former president’s](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/07/27/the-justice-department-is-moving-against-donald-trump) handling of government records. Last week Mr Reinhart gave the Justice Department seven days to redact it to their liking, signalling that at least part of the document might see the light of day. But negotiations between the court and the government about exactly what to publish could yet postpone the unveiling. 

## Misery by design in Myanmar

Five years ago the Burmese army forced nearly 750,000 [Rohingyas to leave Myanmar](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/18/the-rohingyas-are-being-wiped-out-in-slow-motion) amid intense violence. The UN branded the army’s campaign of mass killing, rape and arson a genocide, but no punishments followed. Most of the expelled Rohingyas are now [languishing in Bangladesh](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/06/16/unable-to-send-rohingyas-home-bangladesh-circumscribes-their-lives) in the world’s biggest refugee camp. On Thursday human rights groups will mark “Rohingya Remembrance Day”.

But around 600,000 remain in Myanmar. Many are confined to what Fortify Rights, an American pressure group based in South-East Asia, calls “modern concentration camps”. Conditions are squalid, structures unsound and access to health care scant. Their plight has become ever more dire since the army toppled the government of [Aung San Suu Kyi](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2021/02/01/aung-san-suu-kyi-is-arrested-as-myanmars-generals-seize-power), the de facto leader, last year. They are denied access to education and paid work. The military junta has blocked international-aid agencies from visiting Rohingya camps and villages. No matter which side of the border Rohingyas find themselves on, their experience is comparable: hunger and misery surrounded by barbed wire. 

## Moving markets in Wyoming

In the shadow of the majestic Teton mountain range, just over 100 central bankers and economists from around the world are gathering at a lodge in [Jackson Hole](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/at-the-jackson-hole-meeting-the-fed-ponders-an-uneven-recovery/21804083), Wyoming. Their idyllic retreat, which starts on Thursday, is not all late-summer’s calm: the comments of attendees can shake global markets. The main event at the three-day economic symposium will be a speech by Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve, on Friday.

After [softer inflation data](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/08/05/for-a-change-american-inflation-is-lower-than-expected) in America last month, many investors thought the Fed might relax its hawkish stance. They [piled back into stocks](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/08/18/a-fresh-american-bull-market-is-under-way-can-it-last), fuelling a month-long rally. Mr Powell has a chance to recalibrate expectations with his speech. He may choose to signal that the Fed’s campaign to crush inflation is far from over. That possibility has already rattled markets, with leading indices taking a tumble this week. The descent from high inflation looks a little like the jagged path down the Teton peaks.

## France seeks to befriend Algeria

Sixty years ago Algeria won independence from France after a bloody eight-year war. This painful history renders the link between the two countries complicated even today. So a three-day visit of [Emmanuel Macron](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2021/06/03/france-tries-to-reset-policy-in-africa) to the north African country, which begins on Thursday, has been optimistically billed as one of “friendship”. France’s president hopes to use his first foray to Algeria in five years to forge closer links between businesses, startups and artists.

But first Mr Macron hopes to “soothe memories”, after decades marked by mutual suspicion and accusations. Relations soured last year when Mr Macron reportedly questioned Algeria’s pre-colonial existence as a nation. But he has taken steps to acknowledge [France’s role in certain historical atrocities](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2021/05/13/france-is-confronting-its-history-in-algeria), and set up a “memories and truth” commission on his country’s historical role in Algeria. Now there are new questions, including how to source more natural gas from resource-rich Algeria, and how to ease recently tightened rules for Algerians to obtain French visas. 

## Australia prepares to try an alleged Chinese agent

In 2018 Australia infuriated China by rushing through sweeping laws to [prevent foreign meddling](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2021/05/08/australias-debate-about-china-is-becoming-hot-angry-and-shrill) in its democracy. On Thursday, the only man so far to be accused of breaching them appeared before a court in Victoria. In 2020 Di Sanh Duong, a 67-year-old Australian of Chinese heritage, made a A$37,000 ($25,500) donation to a hospital in Melbourne. Prosecutors allege that he was seeking to gain favour with Alan Tudge, an up-and-coming federal minister whom he invited for the handing over of the cheque, on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. Mr Duong’s lawyer says the donation was a bid to improve the public image of Chinese people in Australia.

On trial is not only Mr Duong but the new laws themselves. Mr Duong is accused of “preparing for” or “planning” interference. The prosecution has used evidence of his links to the Chinese government to build its case. But criminalising contacts and intent, rather than action, is a troubling idea for many lawyers.
