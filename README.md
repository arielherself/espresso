A lawyer for<strong> Donald Trump</strong> signed a statement in June stating that all classified material held at Mr Trump’s home in Florida had been returned to the government, according to the <em>New York Times</em>. But on August 8th [federal agents reportedly removed](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/08/09/an-fbi-raid-on-donald-trumps-home-ignites-a-political-firestorm) 11 sets of classified documents, including material marked “top secret”. The warrant to search Mr Trump’s home was issued because America’s Department of Justice said it believed that the former president violated <strong>the Espionage Act</strong>, which prohibits the possession or transmission of national security information.

<strong>Sir Salman Rushdie</strong>, the Booker-prizewinning [novelist](https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2019/09/05/salman-rushdies-new-novel-is-a-metafictional-romp), was stabbed several times when he was about to deliver a lecture in Chautauqua, in upstate New York. Sir Salman was airlifted to hospital; his agent said he was put on a ventilator and may lose an eye. A 24-year-old man from New Jersey has been arrested and charged with attempted murder. “The Satanic Verses”, Sir Salman’s fourth novel, inspired condemnation upon its release in 1988. Some Muslims judged it blasphemous, and Iran called for his death.

America’s <strong>House of Representatives</strong> approved a $430bn climate, tax and health-care bill, delivering a boost for President Joe Biden ahead of November’s mid-term elections. The <strong>Inflation Reduction Act</strong> is the largest package of climate spending in American history, providing $369bn of support for renewable energy and other green infrastructure. It also aims to lower prescription drug prices and raise taxes on some big firms.

<strong>Taiwan’s</strong> defence ministry said that 13 Chinese air-force planes crossed the Taiwan Strait’s median line. Tensions between America, China and Taiwan [have been high](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/08/11/how-the-crisis-over-taiwan-will-change-us-china-relations) since Nancy Pelosi, an American politician, visited Taiwan earlier this month. America will unveil a new trade plan with Taiwan in the coming days, the White House said, intended to deepen ties with the self-governing island.

<strong>Idaho’s</strong> Supreme Court refused a bid to halt a Republican-backed state law that brings in a near-total ban on <strong>abortion</strong>. Around half of states have or are expected to ban or limit abortion rights following the decision by America’s Supreme Court to overturn <em>[Roe v Wade](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/06/24/the-supreme-courts-rejection-of-roe-will-hurt-the-poorest-most)</em>. Idaho’s measure, which takes effect on August 25th, will allow abortions only in cases of rape, incest or to prevent a pregnant woman’s death. 

The two road bridges into <strong>Kherson</strong>, a city in southern <strong>Ukraine </strong>occupied by Russian forces, are out of use for military supplies, according to British intelligence. Ukraine has for weeks hinted that a counter-attack is imminent, but it faces steep odds to retake the city. Russia has been reinforcing defensive positions throughout the south of the country.

<strong>Taliban</strong> fighters violently dispersed a rare rally in Afghanistan’s capital, <strong>Kabul</strong>, and beat female protesters. Around 40 women marched on the education ministry to protest against the country’s [dire economic situation](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/08/11/afghanistan-is-poorer-and-hungrier-than-a-year-ago) and the hardline Islamist group’s restrictions on women’s rights, before fighters fired guns into the air to scatter the crowd. The protest comes before the first anniversary of the Taliban’s return to power on August 15th.

## Salman Rushdie in hospital after attack

Sir Salman Rushdie, an Indian-born British novelist, has faced hardship because of his work. Some Muslims judged “The Satanic Verses”, the author’s fourth novel, published in 1988, as blasphemous. Iran called for his death, forcing him into hiding. In recent years the threat had seemed to ease, and he spent much of his time in America. On Friday, in upstate New York, he was stabbed multiple times on stage.  
  
 Sir Salman is on a ventilator, and may lose an eye, according to his agent. The suspected attacker, a 24-year-old man from New Jersey, has been charged with attempted murder; his motive is unknown. Hardline Iranian newspapers have praised his actions. Security at the Chautauqua Institution, the arts education centre where the attack took place, was light, according to witnesses. Sir Salman had been due to speak on the topic of America as a home for freedom of expression. In 2017 he told <em>The Economist</em> that “It’s only when somebody tries to gag you that you really begin to believe in free speech.”

## Run, Ron? The appeal of Ron DeSantis

On Sunday Ron DeSantis, Florida’s Republican governor, will speak at a rally for his party’s gubernatorial candidate in New Mexico, Mark Ronchetti. It is just one stop on a national tour that Mr DeSantis is embarking on to support other candidates, including those backed by Donald Trump, rather than focusing on his own campaign.

It is a show of party unity that Mr DeSantis is spending his time stumping for other candidates, but it also raises questions about his own ambitions. Should Mr Trump not make a presidential bid in 2024, Mr DeSantis would be the likely Republican frontrunner. In a straw poll of attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas, released last week, 69% of people said they preferred Mr Trump as the candidate in 2024; Mr DeSantis came second, with 24%. Mr DeSantis may be calculating that for now it is better to shore up his popularity with Trump supporters. After all, at only 43 he is easily young enough to wait until 2028.

## The European Championships find strength in numbers

Sports fans waking up in Munich on Sunday are spoiled for choice. Fancy breakfast in the Olympiapark while watching a triathlon? Or how about track cycling at the Neue Messe München? Or table tennis at the Audi Dome? Until August 21st Munich is hosting an experiment. The associations of nine sports—including athletics, beach volleyball, canoeing, cycling, gymnastics, rowing, sport climbing, triathlon and table tennis—have decided to run their European tournaments in tandem in a single city. 

The idea is that these smaller sports have a better chance of commanding bigger audiences if they work together. That makes sense: after all, the Olympics is more than the sum of its parts. But the European Championships also wants to avoid some Olympic-sized pitfalls. It chose Munich because no new tourist facilities or venues needed to be constructed. Consequently, its budget is around 1% of Tokyo’s 2020 Olympics. It is a lean, efficient approach that could catch on.

## Why thinking hard exhausts your brain

Mental exhaustion is a strange sensation; not quite drowsiness, but an inability to think straight. The body may feel fine, yet the brain wants to do little more than watch television. Researchers writing in <em>Current Biology</em>, a journal, went in search of a physiological basis for this frazzled feeling—and may have found one.

For over six hours, 24 volunteers performed difficult mental problems that required intense cognition—another group was given easier versions. Their brains were scanned throughout the mock workday, which suggested that mental graft induced the build-up of a neurotransmitter called glutamate in the forebrain. As glutamate can be toxic, it seems the brain has to limit cognition to avoid an overload. The industrious volunteers’ decision-making also changed—they began to favour instant rewards over delayed gratification. Your brain on energy-saver mode should be spared important decisions. After a stressful day in the office, some mindless channel-surfing may be just what it needs.

## Weekend profile: Robert Habeck, Germany’s energy hero

Olaf Scholz may be Germany’s chancellor, but to many the man of the hour in Berlin is Robert Habeck, his vice-chancellor and minister for economy and climate change. This is not just because the senior-most Green in the three-party ruling coalition pips his boss in the polls: since this government took office in December Mr Habeck has consistently been named the country’s most popular politician. It is also because his job as energy supremo puts the chatty, studiedly casual 52-year-old on the front lines of the [biggest crisis](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/08/11/germany-is-facing-dramatic-change-in-many-dimensions-all-at-once) Germany has faced in a generation.

By most accounts Mr Habeck has done well. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February placed Germany in a dilemma. Decades of misguided policy had hooked Europe’s biggest economy on Russian fossil fuels. Pipelines from Siberia supplied 55% of its natural gas. But with a mix of charm, money and dealmaking, Mr Habeck has helped shield Germany from potential blackmail by trimming gas use and finding new suppliers. Enhancing his reputation for pragmatism (some would say lack of principle), the vice-chancellor muted his Green beliefs to reignite mothballed coal-fired power stations. A similar nose-holding green light may also keep Germany’s last three nuclear power plants open. They were to close in December as part of a longstanding plan to scrap nuclear power. Polls show even a majority of Green voters realise that, right now, that would be stupid.

Mr Habeck, who hails from Germany’s northernmost state, Schleswig-Holstein, earned a PhD in literature before entering politics. But it is his trademark three-day stubble, preference for open-necked shirts and penchant for blunt honesty that seem to please voters. He has also won points for working smoothly with Annalena Baerbock, the foreign minister, whose choice as the Greens’ candidate for chancellor in last year’s election was tough on Mr Habeck, by his own admission. But the easygoing manner disguises a sharp statesman. Visiting Ukraine last summer, Mr Habeck suggested supplying the country with defensive weapons. Rivals from left, right and centre called him irresponsible. Who looks silly now?
