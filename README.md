<strong>Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva </strong>was sworn in as [Brazil’s president](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2022/12/31/brazils-new-president-faces-a-fiscal-crunch-and-a-fickle-congress) in Brasília, the country’s capital. The left-leaning politician was previously president from 2003 to 2010. He defeated Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right incumbent, in October in the closest election in Brazil’s recent history. Tens of thousands of Lula’s supporters thronged the streets of Brasília. Breaking with past practice, Mr Bolsonaro did not attend the ceremony.

A third of the <strong>world economy</strong> will be hit by a recession in 2023, according to the head of the IMF. Kristalina Georgieva said that [global growth](https://te.arielherself.xyz/podcasts/2022/12/05/what-are-the-prospects-for-the-world-economy-in-2023) will be dragged down by the economies of America, China and the EU which are all “slowing simultaneously”. She predicted that half of the EU would be in a recession, but America “may avoid” one.

<strong>Russia</strong> continued to bombard <strong>Kyiv</strong>, [Ukraine’s](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/12/20/our-country-of-the-year-for-2022-can-only-be-ukraine) capital, and other major cities following a wave of strikes on New Year’s Day. Ukraine’s army said it had shot down 20 objects above Kyiv on Monday morning. Earlier in a New Year speech Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, accused the West of provoking Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and of trying to “weaken and split” his country. 

<strong>Syria’s</strong> army said that <strong>Israeli </strong>missile strikes had killed two soldiers and put the international airport in Damascus, the capital, out of service. It was the second attack on the airport in seven months. The strikes, which targeted [Iranian-backed groups in Syria](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/the-middle-easts-complex-web-of-alliances-is-evolving), came days after a new, right-wing coalition government took office in Israel.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

At midnight on Sunday <strong>Croatia</strong> adopted the <strong>euro</strong> as its currency and joined the Schengen passport-free travel area. The country became part of the EU in 2013 but was only given permission to join the single currency this summer, after the European Central Bank ruled that its [economy](https://te.arielherself.xyz/finance-and-economics/2022/12/21/five-financial-trends-that-2022-killed) was sufficiently aligned with others in the euro zone.

Factory activity in <strong>South Korea</strong> fell for the sixth consecutive month in December, according to a business survey. Manufacturing firms were hit hard by the global economic slowdown and a strike by truckers. Meanwhile in <strong>Indonesia </strong>the annual inflation rate rose slightly in December to 5.51%, remaining well above the central bank’s upper limit of 4% for the seventh consecutive month.

<strong>Kim Jong Un</strong> ordered an “exponential” expansion of <strong>North Korea’s</strong> nuclear arsenal. He also decreed that his country should launch its first spy satellite and develop new intercontinental ballistic missiles. North Korea rounded out 2022—a year in which it conducted a record number of [weapons tests](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/10/18/north-korea-is-preparing-for-another-nuclear-test-or-many)—by launching three ballistic <strong>missiles</strong> towards the Sea of Japan, according to South Korea.

<strong>Word of the week:</strong> <em>masyarakat adat</em>, an Indonesian word for ethnic groups, such as the Baduy, who shun modernity. [Read the full story](https://te.arielherself.xyz/christmas-specials/2022/12/20/in-a-corner-of-java-live-the-amish-of-indonesia).

## 2023 in preview: A feast of great art shows

<em>This week we have been looking ahead to the big stories of 2023. This weekend, culture. Regular Espresso service will resume on Tuesday</em>

The blockbuster [art shows of 2023](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/after-the-pandemic-a-feast-of-great-art-shows-is-coming) will be in Amsterdam and London. In February the [Rijksmuseum](https://te.arielherself.xyz/prospero/2013/04/13/the-opening-of-the-rijksmuseum) will put on the largest-ever show of Johannes Vermeer’s work, bringing together 27 of his 35 surviving paintings. The show will also reveal the master’s method through scientific studies of [“The Milkmaid”](https://te.arielherself.xyz/books-and-arts/2009/09/17/a-dutch-treat), painted in 1660. In March, meanwhile, “After Impressionism” opens at the National Gallery, bringing together Cézanne, Van Gogh, Klimt, Matisse, Munch, Picasso and Rodin to explore how styles such as Cubism and Expressionism developed in cities across Europe. 

New institutions are opening, too. Seoul gets the Robot &amp; AI Museum: as well as being exhibited, robots have been involved in the building’s design, manufacturing and construction. In January the International African-American Museum will open in Charleston, South Carolina, on the site of a wharf where 100,000 enslaved Africans disembarked from ships. A spiritual sibling, the Pan African Heritage Museum, in Ghana, will also open in 2023. Its design resembles a horn, an instrument often used to herald the arrival of something, or someone, special.

## 2023 in preview: An enticing variety of new films

Film buffs will have plenty to watch in 2023. There are adaptations of Alice Walker’s “The Color Purple”, Kristin Hannah’s “The Nightingale” and Roald Dahl’s “The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar”. Martin Scorsese will direct Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro in “Killers of the Flower Moon”, about the murders of Osage tribespeople in Oklahoma in the 1920s. For action fans a doddery Harrison Ford, now in his 80s, will return for a fifth “Indiana Jones” film. 

There will be a surfeit of biographical drama, too. Dustin Lance Black has written the script for “Rustin”, a film about Bayard Rustin, a gay civil-rights activist who organised the March on Washington in 1963. Bradley Cooper will star as Leonard Bernstein, a revered composer and conductor, in “Maestro”. And Cillian Murphy will take on the role of Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. Meanwhile, Margot Robbie plays one of the world’s most famous fictional women, in “Barbie”.

## 2023 in preview: The cricket World Cup

In October, ten teams will meet in India for cricket’s one-day game World Cup. It will be one of the glitziest events the sport has ever seen. 

The millions of Indians who watch televised cricket make for a hugely valuable audience. In 2022 online streaming rights alone to the domestic [Indian Premier League](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/03/26/how-the-ipl-reflects-indias-strengths-and-weaknesses) cost Reliance, an Indian oil-to-retail behemoth, [$2.6bn](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2022/06/16/disney-loses-its-indian-premier-league-streaming-rights). Players are paid handsomely, too. So for foreign cricketers, including those from England, which won the last tournament in 2019, the World Cup will be both an opportunity for national glory and an audition for a life-changing contract.  
  
 Indian money is changing how the game is played as well as watched. Many Indian fans prefer the two-hour “T20” format used in the IPL to the one-day cricket played at the World Cup, or to traditional five-day Test matches. The longer formats are therefore retreating before the juggernaut of Indian-organised T20 tournaments. Two T20 leagues will launch (with Indian-owned teams) in 2023. Many fans of the older, more stately versions of the game dread such developments.
