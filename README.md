Both Russian and Ukrainian reports suggested that the town of <strong>Izyum</strong> had fallen to advancing Ukrainian troops. This followed the fall of a crucial railway interchange at Kupyansk, as a counter-offensive in the <strong>Kharkiv region</strong> continued at pace. Russia’s defence ministry unconvincingly claimed that the retreat by Russian forces was an attempt to “regroup”. Earlier Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, celebrated recent [progress](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/29/ukraine-starts-a-push-to-recapture-kherson-a-crucial-russian-occupied-city), saying that 1,000 square kilometres of Ukrainian territory and “dozens of settlements” had already been [reclaimed](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/04/ukraine-is-losing-fewer-soldiers-in-its-counter-offensive-than-russia-claims) since September 1st, mostly in the east. 

The <strong>Accession Council</strong>, a group of senior officials and politicians that convenes [following the death of a monarch](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2021/10/22/british-royal-succession-queen-elizabeth), formally proclaimed Charles III king on Saturday morning. King Charles delivered his first address as monarch on Friday evening. He honoured the life and service of Queen Elizabeth II and pledged to follow his mother’s example [throughout his reign](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/09/what-will-charles-do-now).

The state funeral of <strong>Queen Elizabeth II </strong>will take place on September 19th, at Westminster Abbey. The queen will lie-in-state for four days at nearby Westminster Hall. She [died](https://te.arielherself.xyz/obituary/2022/09/08/elizabeth-ii-never-laid-down-the-heavy-weight-of-the-crown) on Thursday, at Balmoral Castle, in Scotland. Her remains will first be moved to Edinburgh on Sunday, and then on to London, on Tuesday. Britain’s [oldest and longest-reigning monarch](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/08/the-death-of-elizabeth-ii-marks-the-end-of-an-era) led Britain, and the Commonwealth, through a [period of intense change](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/09/08/britains-longest-serving-ruler-strengthened-the-monarchy). 

Different views emerged between the Department of Justice and <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> legal team over the appointment of a “<strong>special master</strong>”. The independent third party is supposed to review documents seized by the FBI at the former president’s [Mar-a-Lago](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/08/09/an-fbi-raid-on-donald-trumps-home-ignites-a-political-firestorm) estate in August. The two parties set out a selection of their preferred candidates for the role and will disclose their opinions on each other’s choices on Monday. 

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

American lawmakers warned <strong>Apple </strong>it will encounter significant political pressure if it uses chips from <strong>China’s</strong> Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. in its products. Marco Rubio, the Republican vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, told the <em>Financial Times</em> that “Apple is playing with fire”. His criticism follows the recent passing of the [CHIPS act](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/07/29/america-takes-on-china-with-a-giant-microchips-bill), an attempt to bolster America’s position in the semiconductor industry.

The <strong>World Bank</strong> put the cost of [rebuilding](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2022/04/16/what-will-it-cost-to-rebuild-ukraine) <strong>Ukraine</strong> at $349bn—more than one and a half times the country’s GDP last year. In the short term, the bank said, $105bn would be required to prepare for the coming winter and planting season and to repair transport systems, among other necessities. The number of Ukrainians in poverty, or those living on less than $5.50 a day, is projected to rise tenfold, to about a fifth of the population.

<strong>Mexico’s</strong> senate voted to put the civilian-led national guard under the control of the defence ministry. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador had agitated for the controversial change, which human-rights advocates say will reduce transparency and [militarise law enforcement](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-americas/2021/04/29/mexicos-president-is-giving-the-armed-forces-new-powers). The UN criticised the proposal, saying that police “should be subordinate to civilian authorities”.

## Remembering 9/11

On Sunday Americans will mark the 21st anniversary of the attacks of September 11th, in which 19 terrorists from al-Qaeda killed nearly 3,000 people. President Joe Biden plans to lay a wreath at the Pentagon, while the first lady, Jill Biden, will speak at the Flight 93 National Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Kamala Harris, the vice-president, is to attend a ceremony in lower Manhattan. The sombre occasion may remind many not only of the shock, fear and sorrow of that day but also of the solidarity and patriotism that followed—a poignant contrast to the division today. 

Americans’ focus on Islamic extremism has given way to fears of violence from [homegrown political radicals](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/08/06/the-insurrection-failed-what-now-for-americas-far-right). Nearly half of Democrats and Republicans regard members of the opposition party as enemies, according to a recent CBS News poll, and close to two-thirds of Americans expect [political violence](https://te.arielherself.xyz/podcasts/2022/08/26/is-america-entering-a-new-era-of-political-violence) to increase in coming years. There is much to reflect upon.

## Sweden’s far right reaches for power

Sweden’s biggest crisis this autumn is the one all of Europe faces: [rocketing energy prices](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/05/europe-scrambles-to-protect-citizens-from-sky-high-energy-prices). Yet campaigning ahead of the country’s general election on Sunday has been dominated by immigration, segregation and crime. That favours the [far-right Sweden Democrats](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2020/11/26/how-long-will-swedens-nationalists-be-excluded-from-power) (SD), a populist party that has spent years shedding its neo-Nazi roots. This could be the year it gets a share of power. Centre-right parties, who long shunned the SD, are now willing to form a government relying on its support (though not including it). 

Yet the polls suggest the right will win too few seats to form a government. The mighty Social Democrats, long the party of power, have done well under [Magdalena Andersson](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/01/22/the-nordic-left-is-back-in-charge), who became Sweden’s first female prime minister when she took over in November. She has a good chance of forming a coalition with the crucial Centre Party. But to keep her job, she might also need to lean on the leftmost party, the aptly named Left.

## Ukraine punches back

The war took a [dramatic turn](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/09/08/ukraines-army-pierces-russian-lines-near-kharkiv) this week when Ukraine launched a fresh assault in the east of the country, on top of its week-old [offensive in the southern province of Kherson](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/29/ukraine-starts-a-push-to-recapture-kherson-a-crucial-russian-occupied-city). On Tuesday Ukrainian tanks and troops sliced through a weak spot in Russian lines east of the city of Kharkiv. In the following days they encircled the town of Balakliya and moved 50km east—marking one of the most rapid advances seen since Russia invaded in February. 

Ukrainian forces took the key rail junction at Kupyansk on Saturday and reports suggest they also liberated Izyum nearby. Russia claims that the collapse of its line represents a “regroup” before launching a new attack further south in Donetsk province. But Russian military bloggers tracking the war describe panic and confusion. On Thursday Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said that his armies had liberated 1,000 square kilometres in the north-eastern Kharkiv province as well as the southern Kherson province, where progress has been slower.

## The future of the Commonwealth

Of all her foreign duties, [Queen Elizabeth II](https://te.arielherself.xyz/obituary/2022/09/08/elizabeth-ii-never-laid-down-the-heavy-weight-of-the-crown) attached the greatest importance to her role as head of the [Commonwealth](https://te.arielherself.xyz/international/2022/09/09/the-commonwealth-will-miss-queen-elizabeth), a voluntary club created in 1949 as a kind of post-imperial alternative under Britain’s patronage. She was widely respected, even revered, in the 56 independent countries it comprises. Since taking the [British throne in 1953](https://te.arielherself.xyz/leaders/2022/09/08/the-death-of-elizabeth-ii-marks-the-end-of-an-era), she provided much of the glue holding together the club.

Without her, the draw of the modern Commonwealth will be weaker. The club claims to have two chief aims, to strengthen democracy and to nurture economic development. Yet it has no real mechanism for enforcing the first and no big pot of cash for ensuring the second. The organisation still attracts new members (Gabon and Togo joined this year). But as its titular head [Charles III](https://te.arielherself.xyz/britain/2022/09/09/what-will-charles-do-now) could struggle to hold it together, or give it fresh relevance. He will lack the prestige of the queen, who seemed to epitomise the best qualities, of grandeur and fair play, that the British empire claimed to promote.

## Weekend profile: Shavkat Mirziyoyev, Uzbek leader with a reformist bent

When Shavkat Mirziyoyev became president of Uzbekistan in 2016, his country was a pariah in much of the democratic world. Previously Central Asia’s most populous nation had been ruled by Islam Karimov, a ruthless despot who clung to power through the Soviet Union’s collapse and his country’s independence in 1991. Although Karimov earned some goodwill among Western governments for helping military operations in neighbouring Afghanistan after 2001, that soon evaporated amid persistent allegations of corruption and rights abuses, including boiling dissidents alive and massacring anti-government protesters in the city Andijan in 2005. He even locked up his own daughter, once considered a successor. 

In the six years since Mr Mirziyoyev’s ascent, Uzbekistan has undergone a [striking transformation](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2021/10/23/uzbekistans-president-abolished-slave-labour-what-next). He has eased state controls on industry, media, religion and civil society, and [abolished a forced-labour system](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/03/05/uzbekistan-has-succeeded-in-abolishing-forced-labour) for picking cotton, a major export. He has also overseen a diplomatic shift, improving ties with neighbours, [expanding links with China](https://te.arielherself.xyz/asia/2022/09/06/two-new-railway-lines-could-transform-central-asia) and repairing relations with the West. Since America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, he has taken a lead in engaging the Taliban and in lobbying Western countries to follow suit. He will build on that legacy next week by hosting a summit of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, a grouping of regional powers, in the Uzbek city of Samarkand. For China’s president, Xi Jinping, it will be the [first foreign foray in two years](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/09/08/xi-jinping-will-at-last-venture-abroad-again).

Some question Mr Mirziyoyev’s reformist credentials. He was, after all, Karimov’s prime minister for 13 years and maintains many restrictions on religion, media and civil activism. Election monitors have flagged concerns about his two presidential victories, while acknowledging progress towards fairness. In July Amnesty International called for an investigation into reports that his troops had used “unlawful force” in quelling protests against plans to change the constitutional status of Karakalpakstan, an autonomous region. Eighteen protesters died and Mr Mirziyoyev withdrew the proposal. Yet even critics acknowledge that he has revitalised the economy: it now rivals neighbouring Kazakhstan’s as the region’s most dynamic. Mr Mirziyoyev is no model liberal. But in a region long stifled by Soviet-era strongmen, he is still a breath of fresh air.
