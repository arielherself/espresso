<strong>America</strong> and <strong>Taiwan</strong> said they would begin <strong>trade talks</strong>, under an initiative established jointly in June. The first round of negotiations will take place in early autumn, said Sarah Bianchi, America’s deputy trade representative. China said it opposes the talks, and warned America to “stop making misjudgements”. The announcement comes as tensions between America and China over the status of the self-governing island—which China regards as a breakaway territory—are at their [highest in decades](https://te.arielherself.xyz/china/2022/08/11/how-the-crisis-over-taiwan-will-change-us-china-relations).

<strong>Mike Pence</strong>, America’s former vice-president, asked Republicans to cease their attacks on law-enforcement agencies over the <strong>FBI’s</strong> [investigation](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/08/10/the-raid-on-mar-a-lago-could-shake-americas-foundations) into Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump’s home. Many in their party have [raged against](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/08/09/an-fbi-raid-on-donald-trumps-home-ignites-a-political-firestorm) the raid, with some calling to “defund” the FBI. Mr Pence called these “just as wrong as calls to ‘defund the police’.” He also said that, if asked, he would consider participating in the efforts of the House select committee investigating Mr Trump’s role in the [January 6th riot](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/07/21/the-january-6th-committee-has-hobbled-donald-trump) at the Capitol.

Minutes from the latest meeting of policymakers at America’s <strong>Federal Reserve</strong>, [held on July 26-27th](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/07/27/the-fed-is-no-longer-taking-baby-steps-to-rein-in-inflation) but revealed on Wednesday, showed they regard <strong>inflation </strong>as far from tamed. They paid heed to the danger of a slowdown too, but reckon that the bulk of their rate-raising work is yet to come—which was enough to make markets tremble.

21 people died following a large explosion inside a mosque in <strong>Kabul</strong>, the capital of Afghanistan, during evening prayers on Wednesday. Police reported another 33 had been injured. No one has yet claimed responsibility. Last week [Islamic State](https://te.arielherself.xyz/the-economist-explains/2021/08/27/what-is-the-islamic-state-khorasan-province) said it carried out a bombing in Kabul that succeeded in killing a prominent pro-Taliban cleric.

<strong>Israel</strong> and <strong>Turkey</strong> agreed to restore full diplomatic ties, ending a long standoff. Ambassadors will be reinstated for the first time since they were expelled in 2018 over Israeli forces’ [killing 60 Palestinians](https://te.arielherself.xyz/briefing/2018/05/17/deadly-protests-on-gazas-border-with-israel) during a protest. A visit to Turkey in March by [Israel’s president](https://te.arielherself.xyz/middle-east-and-africa/2022/04/02/israels-unprecedented-welcome-to-arab-leaders-in-the-negev), Isaac Herzog, marked the beginnings of a thaw, followed by a pledge to discuss restarting direct flights by Israeli airlines.

Rochelle Walensky, the director of America’s <strong>Centres for Disease Control and Prevention</strong>, called for a reorganisation of the public-health agency on the basis of its [clumsy response](https://te.arielherself.xyz/united-states/2022/03/12/taking-stock-as-america-moves-into-a-new-phase-of-the-pandemic) to the covid-19 pandemic. An external report found that its messages to the public were often confusing, and recommended that lab data and scientific studies be published faster.

<strong>Airbnb</strong>, an American [holiday-rental goliath](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2020/12/08/airbnb-guests-seek-out-cleaner-properties-in-the-pandemic) with a global footprint, is digging in its heels against unauthorised parties. It banned shindigs in June, making permanent a policy originally introduced to deter covid-19 infections. This week it unveiled “anti-party technology”—profiling, in effect—to help owners identify potential party-throwers. Grateful to have survived the pandemic, Airbnb is eager to make nice with the neighbours.

## Turkey sets foot in Ukraine

Turkey’s president has been immersed in the war in Ukraine as a [mediator](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/01/the-first-grain-ship-leaves-odessa-under-a-un-brokered-deal). But on Thursday Recep Tayyip Erdogan will visit the country for the first time since Russia’s invasion. In Lviv, a long way from the front line, he will have his first face-to-face meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky, his Ukrainian counterpart. António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, will also be there.

Turkey has won kudos for brokering, along with the UN, a deal between Ukraine and Russia to restart grain exports through the Black Sea. [Turkish-made Bayraktar drones](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/02/12/turkey-is-the-arms-industrys-new-upstart) have also helped the Ukrainian army push back the Russian offensive. But Mr Erdogan is performing a delicate balancing act. On August 5th he alarmed Western governments by meeting Vladimir Putin and signalling that [Turkey was open for Russian business](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/02/24/turkeys-rapprochement-with-russia-may-not-survive-the-war-in-ukraine).

As for Mr Zelensky, he will want to probe his guests about expanding the [grain deal](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2022/08/01/the-first-grain-ship-leaves-odessa-under-a-un-brokered-deal) into a wider negotiation to end the conflict. He will also bring up the risks around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, where fighting has sparked fears of a nuclear disaster.

## A new look for Estée Lauder

The past year has been hard for beauty firms, including Estée Lauder, which reports results on Thursday. The American company has been hammered by [lockdown-induced slowdowns](https://te.arielherself.xyz/business/2021/06/19/hit-by-covid-19-italian-makeup-makers-are-looking-pretty-again) in China, which by last year accounted for 36% of its revenues. Estée Lauder’s stock has shed a quarter of its value since the start of the year, and further decline is expected.

It may be time for a bolder look. Estée Lauder’s past strategy has been to acquire minority stakes in smaller beauty companies. But its eyes are now set on Tom Ford, a fashion brand worth $3bn. Should it succeed, the acquisition would be Estée Lauder’s largest yet. It would also be its first foray into luxury fashion, following in the footsteps of L’Oréal, a rival cosmetics giant, which bought Mugler, a perfume seller, in 2019. Tom Ford’s luxury cosmetics range could help Estée Lauder strengthen its position in the fast-growing prestige beauty sector. It would also boost its top line, and brush off some of its upsets in China.

## Serbia and Kosovo try, again, to find harmony

On Thursday Aleksandar Vucic, the Serbian president, and Albin Kurti, the Kosovar prime minister, will meet Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign-policy chief, in Brussels. The most important issue is the contested status of a proposed association that would grant some autonomy to Serbian-majority municipalities inside Kosovo.

Tensions are [once again rising](https://te.arielherself.xyz/by-invitation/2022/03/14/the-president-of-kosovo-warns-against-the-appeasement-of-autocrats) between Serbia and its former province. One of the triggers was a decision last month by Kosovo’s government to oblige Serbian citizens travelling to Kosovo to receive temporary ID cards in place of their passports. Serbian officials protested against the policy, and it was eventually postponed—but not before social media exploded with rumours of a Serbian invasion. 

NATO soldiers in Kosovo have a mandate to defend the country. That makes an invasion highly unlikely. But the same goes for political progress. Messrs Kurti and Vucic loathe each other, and [ten years of EU-sponsored talks](https://te.arielherself.xyz/europe/2018/02/15/a-decade-since-independence-kosovo-is-still-violent) are no longer producing results. Few think this round will be much different.

## Adjusting England’s A-levels

During the pandemic 18-year-olds in England were spared from sitting A-levels, the usual school-leavers’ exams. They were judged instead by their teachers, who marked their charges generously. Grades shot up, even though most pupils were learning less than usual. 

The government has begun correcting that trend this year. A-level results released on Thursday showed that the percentage of exam papers awarded the highest two grades fell to 36%, down from 45% last year. That is the result of a deliberate decision to start bringing grades more in line with the ones doled out before the pandemic.

Although this is sensible, it will still feel jarring to many students. Moreover, spots at the best universities have been harder to come by this year, because they took on so many more students during the pandemic. And the return of rigorous testing will only highlight uncomfortable disparities between schools that managed to cope during the pandemic, and those in which a lot of teaching was missed.

## Humans are destroying carbon dating

When [carbon dating](https://te.arielherself.xyz/graphic-detail/2022/08/12/surging-fossil-fuel-emissions-are-ruining-carbon-dating) was discovered in 1946, it revolutionised archaeology. The technique relies on the principle that living things absorb atmospheric carbon, including carbon-14, a radioactive variant. When an organism dies, its level of carbon-14 begins to fall as the isotope decays. So the remaining amount detected in a relic—accounting for the concentration in the atmosphere—can yield an estimate of the time that has passed since its death. 

But human activity is rendering the method useless. The end of above-ground atomic-weapons testing has led to falling carbon-14 concentrations in the atmosphere, compared with their spike during the cold war. And surging carbon-dioxide emissions dilute its concentration even further, so that modern objects have the same levels as those from 100 years ago. This makes it harder to date anything, from human remains to aged whiskies. By 2050 scientists reckon a contemporary item will have the same carbon timestamp as something from the Middle Ages. Carbon dating presumably will need to be retired. For now it will simply be augmented by guesswork.
