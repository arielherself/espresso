Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, welcomed the UN’s calls for a [safety zone](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2022/09/06/how-to-prevent-a-crisis-at-the-zaporizhia-nuclear-power-plant-according-to-a-fukushima-veteran) around the <strong>Zaporizhia</strong> nuclear station. Europe’s [biggest nuclear power plant](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/19/what-is-at-stake-at-ukraines-zaporizhia-nuclear-plant), in Russian-held territory in southern Ukraine, has been the site of shelling for months. Last week 14 UN inspectors visited the site; two have stayed on. Meanwhile President Vladimir Putin appeared to threaten a [deal](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/28/will-the-grain-deal-between-russia-and-ukraine-reduce-global-hunger) allowing Ukraine’s grain exports to resume via the Black Sea. Addressing the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok Mr Putin claimed that “practically all” of Ukraine’s grain exports were being sent to the EU, rather than the poorest countries.

The <strong>Biden administration </strong>announced that <strong>tech firms</strong> which receive federal funding under its new [CHIPS Act](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/29/america-takes-on-china-with-a-giant-microchips-bill) will not be allowed to build any “advanced technology” facilities, or factories, in China for ten years. The move was justified on [national security](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/07/07/britain-and-america-sound-a-joint-alarm-over-china) grounds, amidst fears of [China](https://www.economist.com/international/2022/01/29/will-china-dominate-the-world-of-semiconductors) stealing such technology. America also wants to rebuild its own share of the global [semiconductor](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/10/after-a-turbocharged-boom-are-chipmakers-in-for-a-supersize-bust) market, now just 10%, down from nearly 40% in 1990.

<strong>China’s export</strong> growth slowed as global demand weakened and domestic covid-19 lockdowns and heatwaves [hit production](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/06/will-chinas-economy-ever-overtake-americas). Exports increased by 7.1% year on year in August, compared with 18% in July. Import growth was also sluggish because of tepid domestic demand. Asian stockmarkets slumped in response. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares fell to its lowest level in two years.

<strong>Germany’s</strong> most energy intensive industries, including chemical and metal production, saw a 6.9% fall in production between February and July as [sky-high energy prices](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/05/europe-scrambles-to-protect-citizens-from-sky-high-energy-prices) bite. Germany has turned away from <strong>natural gas</strong> to generate electricity since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine [imperilled its supply](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter). The use of renewables has increased, but also generation from coal, which rose 17% in the first half of the year.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Liz Truss</strong>, Britain’s [new prime minister](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/05/what-kind-of-prime-minister-will-liz-truss-be), appointed <strong>Kwasi Kwarteng</strong> as chancellor of the exchequer, or finance minister. The son of Ghanaian immigrants, Mr Kwarteng—hitherto the business secretary—supports cutting taxes and regulation, and has encouraged “fiscal loosening” to help households afford dearer energy prices. On Thursday Ms Truss is expected to unveil a proposal to freeze average annual <strong>energy bills </strong>at about £2,500 ($2,880); they may otherwise [jump](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/08/26/energy-bills-in-britain-are-soaring) by 80% in October. The subsidies could cost up to £100bn, and are expected to be paid for by borrowing.

<strong>Illumina</strong>, an American biotech firm, said it would appeal against an EU ruling that bars it from acquiring <strong>GRAIL</strong>, a cancer-screening startup. American authorities had approved the $7.1bn deal, but European regulators vetoed it on the grounds that it would [stifle competition](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/09/11/the-google-of-genomics-meets-the-techbashers-of-antitrust). The <em>Financial Times</em> reported that Illumina will argue the EU has no jurisdiction to veto a merger between two American companies.

Anthony Albanese, <strong>Australia’s </strong>prime minister, appealed to <strong>China </strong>to allow the family of <strong>Cheng Lei</strong> to visit her in jail. Ms Cheng, a Chinese-born Australian journalist, has spent two years detained in China under accusation of “supplying state secrets”. She is awaiting the verdict of a behind-closed-doors trial in March. Many regard her as [a victim](https://www.economist.com/china/2020/09/09/tensions-between-china-and-the-west-threaten-journalism) of the breakdown in relations between Australia and China.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> €65bn, the minimum cost of Germany’s energy-bill relief package, equivalent to 1.8% of the country’s GDP. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/05/europe-scrambles-to-protect-citizens-from-sky-high-energy-prices).

## Bolsonaristas rally in Brazil

As well as the usual military parades, a fleet of tractors will lumber through Brazil’s capital, Brasília, on independence day on Wednesday. Farmers are just one group to show support for the country’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, ahead of a heavily-contested [election on October 2nd](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/07/14/might-jair-bolsonaro-try-to-steal-brazils-election). Supporters of the right-wing populist will take to the streets in other big cities too. In Rio de Janeiro, Mr Bolsonaro will meet fans on Copacabana Beach. 

The rallies are meant to drum up support for a president who is trailing in the polls. But <em>bolsonaristas </em>mistrust the surveys. They echo their leader’s unsupported claims that the country’s electronic voting system could easily be hacked. They accuse the [electoral court](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2021/09/11/jair-bolsonaro-fires-up-his-fans-by-attacking-judges) of bias in favour of his rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a leftist former president. Mr Bolsonaro has fanned these sentiments, calling on supporters to defend “transparency” and “liberty”. In turn, they have suggested that the president “call in the armed forces” and “clean out the Supreme Court”. If political tensions boil over, the parades could spill into violence.

## Another year, another iPhone

As has become the custom at Apple’s annual summits in Silicon Valley, on Wednesday the world’s biggest tech firm will show off a revamped [iPhone](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/31/apple-already-sold-everyone-an-iphone-now-what). Don’t expect anything revolutionary. The newest versions of Apple’s flagship will mainly have faster chips, better cameras and bigger screens. They will probably be more expensive: the top-of-the-line ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max, for instance, is expected to start at $1,199—$100 more than its predecessor.

  
 The event, which is the first in-person gathering since 2019, will probably also bring new AirPods, iPads and Apple Watches. But Apple is still mainly an iPhone company. The device accounted for nearly half of the firm’s sales between April and June, worth $83bn in total. Its smartphones now have more users in America than those running on Android, Google’s operating system, according to Counterpoint, a research firm. Apple’s next act is scheduled for next year, when it is likely to release a much-anticipated [mixed-reality headset](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/04/09/from-apple-to-google-big-tech-is-building-vr-and-ar-headsets).

## Japan’s phantom reopening

Tourists hoping to catch the tail end of summer in Japan will be disappointed. On Wednesday the country eased travel rules—but only a bit. Tourists will still be required to obtain visas and to book their travel through a certified agency. The one concession is that the tours no longer have to be guided. Citizens, permanent residents and business visitors will gain more, with fully vaccinated travellers relieved of the need to take a pre-departure PCR test. The daily cap on arrivals will rise from 20,000 to 50,000.

Japan has been [hyper-cautious about reopening](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/07/what-pandemic-border-closures-say-about-japans-view-of-outsiders) after the pandemic. That has left it lagging behind its peers in the G7 and neighbours in Asia, many of which have started welcoming tourists more readily. Yet the closed-door policies have been overwhelmingly popular with Japanese voters. With his approval ratings sliding, Kishida Fumio, [Japan’s prime minister](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/14/japan-should-stay-true-to-abe-shinzos-vision-up-to-a-point), is unlikely to take a risk on opening up more anytime soon.

## As safe as houses?

Like most central banks, the Bank of Canada is quickly [raising borrowing costs](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/30/central-bankers-worry-that-a-new-era-of-high-inflation-is-beginning). It is shaping up for another jump on Wednesday, from 2.5% to 3.25%. Inflation has come off its recent peaks but is still near 8%, pushed up by unsustainable wage growth and still-high expectations of future inflation.

But even more so than other rich countries, Canada faces acute risks from higher borrowing costs. In recent years there has been an [unprecedented housing boom](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/09/air-starts-to-seep-out-of-the-bubbly-canadian-property-market). Prices are more than 300% higher, in real terms, than in 2000. Higher interest rates will drive up mortgage costs, making homes less affordable and letting some of the air out of the bubbly property market. But household debt is worryingly high, at 185% of disposable income. Given that backdrop, falling house prices could deal a big blow to consumer confidence and weigh on spending more generally.

## Reality catches up with meme stocks

The [GameStop hype](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/01/29/as-trading-restrictions-are-lifted-the-gamestop-frenzy-continues) became a parable for America’s frenzied stockmarket. The American video-game retailer made headlines last January when an investor stampede pushed its share price up roughly 20-fold in three weeks. The rally was egged on by amateur investors on social media seeking to squeeze professional short-sellers who had bet against the company. GameStop’s sudden share-price volatility, exacerbated by online attention, made it the archetypal [“meme stock”](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/07/06/are-meme-stocks-harmless-fun-or-a-threat-to-the-financial-old-guard). 

On Wednesday the unlikely stockmarket star will deliver its quarterly earnings report. GameStop is still priced at over five times its value at the start of last year, despite lacklustre performance. The bricks-and-mortar business is trying to move online, but struggling to compete with behemoths like Amazon. The company also missed the boat on the crypto craze with ill-timed launches of an NFT marketplace and a digital wallet. Investors in [meme stocks](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/the-phenomenon-of-meme-stocks-could-be-here-to-stay) are guided more by hype than fundamentals, but reality always catches up eventually.
