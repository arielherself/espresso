<strong>Pope Benedict XVI</strong>, the head of the Roman Catholic Church from 2005 until his resignation in 2013, [died aged 95](https://www.economist.com/news/2022/12/31/pope-benedict-xvi-was-an-iron-fist-in-a-white-glove). He was the first pontiff in 600 years to stand down, and styled himself the “pope emeritus”. Pope Francis said his predecessor had been a gift to the world, “so noble” and “so kind”.

At least one person died and several were injured in the third consecutive day of Russian [strikes](https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis) on Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Recalling attacks also at Christmas and Easter, Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, claimed that Russia was “for the devil”. Sergei Shoigu, <strong>Russia’s </strong>defence minister, claimed that victory over Ukraine was “inevitable”, but admitted that Russia would begin 2023 in a “difficult military-political situation”.

The <strong>New Year </strong>has been celebrated around the world—in many places, without restrictions for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began. Crowds gathered in China despite the sharp rise in coronavirus infections. But the turn of the year passed without the usual fireworks in Red Square, in Moscow; and the streets of Kyiv, a city under curfew, were empty. Malaysia’s government cancelled an event in Kuala Lumpur after a landslide in the country killed dozens and displaced thousands.

Xi Jinping, <strong>China’s </strong>president, said his country “unswervingly stands on the right side of history”. In a televised New Year’s Eve address Mr Xi also acknowledged that his country had “entered a new phase” in its response to the [covid-19 pandemic](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/12/28/covid-19-is-tearing-through-china) and faced “tough challenges”. Meanwhile the Philippines became the latest country to restrict or increase checks on travellers from China.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

South Korea said that <strong>North Korea</strong> had fired three ballistic <strong>missiles</strong> towards the Sea of Japan, east of the peninsula, rounding off a year in which the North carried out a record number of tests. Yonhap, a South Korean news agency, reported that before the latest launch the North had fired around 70 ballistic missiles in 2022. On Monday five North Korean drones crossed into the South—the first such sortie since 2017.

Hundreds of thousands of <strong>Palestinians </strong>attended a rally in Gaza to mark the 58th anniversary of the founding of the Fatah party, the Associated Press reported. Although Fatah runs the Palestinian Authority, based in the West Bank, Hamas, its militant rival, controls the Gaza Strip and allowed the demonstration to go ahead. In <strong>Israel</strong>, which with Egypt blockades the Gaza Strip, a new, right-wing coalition government [took office](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/29/israels-new-government-is-the-most-right-wing-ever) this week.

<strong>Venezuela’s </strong>opposition ousted <strong>Juan </strong><strong>Guaidó </strong>as the leader of the country’s national assembly, and dissolved his interim government, as its supporters have styled it. [Mr Guaidó](https://worldin.economist.com/article/17344/edition2020way-change-venezuela) had won [international recognition](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/01/26/juan-guaido-wins-diplomatic-recognition-as-venezuelas-president) in 2019 after Venezuela’s strongman, [Nicolás Maduro](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2021/06/03/venezuelas-strongman-wants-better-relations-with-the-united-states), declared himself re-elected in 2018. Mr Maduro controls the army and most of the country, but the opposition has some of its foreign assets—and hopes to present a united front for elections in 2024.

<strong>Word of the week:</strong> <em>masyarakat adat</em>, an Indonesian word for ethnic groups, such as the Baduy, who shun modernity. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2022/12/20/in-a-corner-of-java-live-the-amish-of-indonesia).

## 2023 in preview: A feast of great art shows

<em>This week we have been looking ahead to the big stories of 2023. This weekend, culture. Regular Espresso service will resume on Tuesday</em>

The blockbuster [art shows of 2023](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/after-the-pandemic-a-feast-of-great-art-shows-is-coming) will be in Amsterdam and London. In February the [Rijksmuseum](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2013/04/13/the-opening-of-the-rijksmuseum) will put on the largest-ever show of Johannes Vermeer’s work, bringing together 27 of his 35 surviving paintings. The show will also reveal the master’s method through scientific studies of [“The Milkmaid”](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2009/09/17/a-dutch-treat), painted in 1660. In March, meanwhile, “After Impressionism” opens at the National Gallery, bringing together Cézanne, Van Gogh, Klimt, Matisse, Munch, Picasso and Rodin to explore how styles such as Cubism and Expressionism developed in cities across Europe. 

New institutions are opening, too. Seoul gets the Robot &amp; AI Museum: as well as being exhibited, robots have been involved in the building’s design, manufacturing and construction. In January the International African-American Museum will open in Charleston, South Carolina, on the site of a wharf where 100,000 enslaved Africans disembarked from ships. A spiritual sibling, the Pan African Heritage Museum, in Ghana, will also open in 2023. Its design resembles a horn, an instrument often used to herald the arrival of something, or someone, special.

## 2023 in preview: An enticing variety of new films

Film buffs will have plenty to watch in 2023. There are adaptations of Alice Walker’s “The Color Purple”, Kristin Hannah’s “The Nightingale” and Roald Dahl’s “The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar”. Martin Scorsese will direct Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro in “Killers of the Flower Moon”, about the murders of Osage tribespeople in Oklahoma in the 1920s. For action fans a doddery Harrison Ford, now in his 80s, will return for a fifth “Indiana Jones” film. 

There will be a surfeit of biographical drama, too. Dustin Lance Black has written the script for “Rustin”, a film about Bayard Rustin, a gay civil-rights activist who organised the March on Washington in 1963. Bradley Cooper will star as Leonard Bernstein, a revered composer and conductor, in “Maestro”. And Cillian Murphy will take on the role of Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. Meanwhile, Margot Robbie plays one of the world’s most famous fictional women, in “Barbie”.

## 2023 in preview: The cricket World Cup

In October, ten teams will meet in India for cricket’s one-day game World Cup. It will be one of the glitziest events the sport has ever seen. 

The millions of Indians who watch televised cricket make for a hugely valuable audience. In 2022 online streaming rights alone to the domestic [Indian Premier League](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/03/26/how-the-ipl-reflects-indias-strengths-and-weaknesses) cost Reliance, an Indian oil-to-retail behemoth, [$2.6bn](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/06/16/disney-loses-its-indian-premier-league-streaming-rights). Players are paid handsomely, too. So for foreign cricketers, including those from England, which won the last tournament in 2019, the World Cup will be both an opportunity for national glory and an audition for a life-changing contract.  
  
 Indian money is changing how the game is played as well as watched. Many Indian fans prefer the two-hour “T20” format used in the IPL to the one-day cricket played at the World Cup, or to traditional five-day Test matches. The longer formats are therefore retreating before the juggernaut of Indian-organised T20 tournaments. Two T20 leagues will launch (with Indian-owned teams) in 2023. Many fans of the older, more stately versions of the game dread such developments.
