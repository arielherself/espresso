America’s justice department found a new batch of classified documents at <strong>President Joe Biden’s </strong>private residence. After a 13-hour search, officials seized documents from Mr Biden’s time in the Senate and as vice-president. The discovery is the latest in a series of such findings that has caused a furore over Mr Biden’s [mishandling of government files](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/01/13/the-presidential-mislaying-of-classified-documents-is-infectious). Earlier this month Merrick Garland, the attorney-general, appointed a special counsel to review Mr Biden’s case. 

Relations between <strong>Sweden and Turkey</strong> worsened after a far-right politician burnt a copy of the Koran at a protest in Stockholm outside the Turkish embassy. The Turkish foreign ministry called the decision to permit the demonstration “completely unacceptable”. A planned visit to Ankara by Sweden’s defence minister had already been cancelled. Turkey’s objections are holding up the accession to NATO of both Sweden and Finland.

The president of <strong>Brazil</strong>, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, sacked the head of the army two weeks after thousands of protesters [attacked](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/01/12/a-copycat-insurrection-in-brazil-and-its-troubling-aftermath) and vandalised the congress and other government buildings in the capital. Supporters of <strong>President Lula</strong> claim that some members of the armed forces colluded with the rioters, backers of the previous president Jair Bolsinaro. General Julio Cesar de Arruda had only taken up the role on December 30th, just before Mr Bolsinaro’s [term in office ](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/10/31/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-will-be-brazils-next-president)ended.

<strong>New Zealand’s</strong> ruling Labour Party formally elected Chris Hikpkins to succeed Jacinda Ardern as leader, and thus the new prime minister. Mr Hipkins, currently the minister for police, public service and education, will be sworn in on Wednesday. The charismatic Ms Ardern [resigned](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/01/19/jacinda-ardern-resigns-as-new-zealands-prime-minister) as prime minister last Thursday, complaining that she has nothing “left in the tank.”

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

Tens of thousands of <strong>Israelis</strong> took to the streets to protest against plans to [reform the country’s judiciary](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/01/16/binyamin-netanyahu-rushes-to-take-on-israels-supreme-court). The recently elected government, led by Binyamin Netanyahu, is trying to curb the powers of the Supreme Court by tightening political control over judicial appointments. Mr Netanyahu has dismissed the protests as a refusal by his opponents to accept the results of the general election in November.

<strong>Peru’s government</strong> closed <strong>Machu Picchu</strong>, the country’s most famous tourist destination, because of [continuing protests](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/01/19/perus-political-chaos-looks-likely-to-persist) against President Dina Boluarte, in which dozens have been killed, including at least one on Saturday. Hundreds of tourists are reported to be stranded at the 15th-century Inca fortress. Protesters have for months demanded the president’s resignation and fresh elections.

The <strong>Iranian rial</strong> dropped to a record low against the dollar, as inflation continued to spiral. A year ago the dollar was worth well under 300,000 rials on unofficial markets; now it will fetch more than 440,000. [Protests](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/01/12/protests-have-subsided-in-iran-but-clerics-cannot-yet-proclaim-victory) that have disturbed Iran since September have petered out, but the country must still contend with the daunting international sanctions that were imposed to persuade it to curb its nuclear programme.

<strong>Word of the week: </strong><em>chunyu</em>, meaning “pure desire” in Mandarin. The make-up style from China, which involves trying to look alluring and innocent all at once, is now trending in Japan.

## France and Germany’s fractious friendship

Sixty years after France and Germany signed a treaty to cement their friendship, the two countries will hold a [bilateral summit](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/01/19/france-and-germany-stifle-their-spats-to-celebrate-a-60-year-friendship) in Paris on Sunday. President Emmanuel Macron and Chancellor Olaf Scholz will speak before scores of ministers and parliamentarians at the Sorbonne. They will then hold a joint cabinet meeting, and finish with dinner <em>à deux</em>.

The summit comes at a tricky time. Russia’s war on Ukraine has exposed longstanding differences between the two countries, notably over defence and [energy](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/11/24/the-costs-and-consequences-of-europes-energy-crisis-are-growing). The two governments have struggled to find common ground; their leaders lack personal chemistry. Some countries closer to Russia’s borders argue that France and Germany have lost their leadership roles in Europe. 

But such troubles will doubtless be put aside during the festivities in Paris. France and Germany [often disagree](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/27/europe-has-a-problem-france-and-germany-have-forgotten-how-to-argue), only to find a way to resolve their differences. The pair have little option but to keep trying, however difficult it seems right now.

## Roe’s would-be 50th anniversary

A different mood will loom over Sunday’s public gatherings for <em>Roe v Wade</em> Day, the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. Seven justices backed <em>Roe</em> in 1973; last June, five voted to ditch it as “egregiously wrong from the start”. Organisers are pitching Sunday’s rallies as “bigger than <em>Roe</em>” and a fight “for a feminist future”. 

In the past few months, pro-choicers have won several state-level skirmishes over reproductive rights. Six states—including Kansas, Kentucky and Michigan—have held referendum votes that either [solidified abortion rights](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/11/where-abortion-was-on-the-ballot-americans-voted-to-protect-it) or repelled efforts to undermine them. A new rule from the Food and Drug Administration makes abortion pills easier to acquire in many pharmacies and by mail. Overall, though, the horizon for abortion rights is grim in post-<em>Roe</em> America. Women in at least 13 states who could legally end their pregnancies a year ago now lack that right.

## America’s National Football League holds playoffs

This weekend the remaining eight teams in contention for the NFL championship on February 12th will be whittled down to four. For the first time in 13 years, neither the 45-year-old [Tom Brady](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/01/07/the-nfls-greatest-player-is-also-its-oldest), whose Tampa Bay Buccaneers lost to the Dallas Cowboys last weekend, nor the 39-year-old Aaron Rodgers, whose Green Bay Packers missed the playoffs, are among the final octet. All eight remaining quarterbacks are in their 20s. Which ones prove as enduring as Mr Brady and Mr Rodgers remains to be seen.

The weekend’s most compelling storyline may be in Buffalo, where the Bills face the Cincinnati Bengals for the second time in three weeks. Their last meeting ended without a winner: the game was cancelled when Damar Hamlin collapsed with a stopped heart after taking a helmet to the chest. But with the Bills struggling against the Dolphins last weekend, the Kansas City Chiefs, who have appeared in two of the past three Super Bowls, are the bettors’ clear favourite to win the title.

## A big-screen adaptation of “Cat Person”

Perhaps not since 1948 and “The Lottery”, Shirley Jackson’s tale of ritualised cruelty in an American town, has one of the <em>New Yorker</em>’s short stories attracted so much attention. “Cat Person”, by Kristen Roupenian, became an internet sensation after its publication in 2017. It has now been adapted into a film, which premieres this weekend at the Sundance Film Festival.

“Cat Person” describes a brief, discomfiting liaison. Margot (Emilia Jones), a 20-year-old student, meets Robert (Nicholas Braun, of “Succession” fame), a 34-year-old man. They flirt, text and go on a date. That evening, despite Margot’s increasing revulsion, they have sex.

Female readers saw it as a distillation of the grim lengths to which women will go to avoid seeming, in Margot’s words, “spoiled and capricious”. Male readers argued that Robert merely followed his date’s lead. The new film will reignite the discussion about the power dynamics of contemporary relationships.

## Weekend profile: Matteo Messina Denaro, captured mafioso

“Kind, very kind” was how a fellow patient remembered the man she knew as Andrea Bonafede. In a television interview, the woman described how he had befriended her while they were undergoing chemotherapy at the Maddalena hospital in Palermo, Sicily. “Andrea”, whose colon cancer was spreading to his liver, had swapped telephone numbers not just with her but with some of her girlfriends. Then on Monday he was arrested, identified as Italy’s most wanted man, Matteo Messina Denaro, and accused of some of the most appalling crimes in Italy’s recent history. 

Nicknamed <em>U Siccu</em> (the skinny one) and more sinisterly as<em> Diabolik</em>, Mr Messina Denaro was among the Sicilian Mafia bosses who felt themselves so powerful in the early 1990s that they could take on the state. He was a leading ally of the Corleonesi clan, which originated in the market town of Corleone and which wrested control of Cosa Nostra with a campaign of unparalleled savagery. It was he and his friends who planted the bombs that killed the anti-Mafia prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino and who mounted a campaign of terror attacks to try to bend the government of the day to their will.

Mr Messina Denaro had the reputation of a playboy—elegant and with a taste for fast cars and attractive women. Indeed. The police found that “Mr Bonafede’s” watch was worth €35,000 ($37,800). His fellow patient noted that, even in the torrid heat of a Sicilian summer, “Andrea” always arrived at the hospital in a formal, long-sleeved shirt.

For many years it was assumed that he had succeeded the Corleonesi’s leader, [Salvatore Riina](https://www.economist.com/europe/2017/06/08/italy-struggles-to-deal-with-an-aged-godfather), as “Boss of Bosses”. But the latest view is that, while a symbol of the Mafia’s ability to defy the law, he was never more than the kingpin in his native province of Trapani. Still, the significance of Mr Messina Denaro’s arrest is that he was the last of those bosses still at large more than 30 years later. His capture sends a powerful message that the state always wins, eventually.
