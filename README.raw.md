<strong>Taiwan </strong>scrambled jets to ward off 27 <strong>Chinese </strong>warplanes that, according to Taiwanese officials, had crossed into the island’s air-defence zone. Chinese fighter jets also breached the median line that divides the Taiwan Strait and drones were reported to have flown over Taiwanese islands. Cyberattacks were launched too. The posturing followed [the visit to Taiwan](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/08/03/nancy-pelosi-has-left-taiwan-the-real-crisis-may-be-just-beginning) of <strong>Nancy Pelosi, </strong>the speaker of America’s House of Representatives. China claims the self-governing island claims as its own. 

American, European and <strong>Iranian</strong> officials will on Thursday hold a new round of talks on reviving their <strong>nuclear deal</strong>. The [agreement](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/02/the-zombie-nuclear-deal), which was signed in 2015 and abandoned by Donald Trump in 2018, lifted many international sanctions on Iran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear programme. Negotiations to revive it have been ongoing for more than a year. All parties downplayed expectations of a breakthrough.

America’s Senate and Italy’s parliament approved the accession of <strong>Finland</strong> and <strong>Sweden</strong> to NATO. Both countries applied for membership to the alliance following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Full membership requires approval from all 30 of NATO’s members. Seven, [including sceptical Turkey](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/06/16/is-turkey-more-trouble-to-nato-than-it-is-worth), have yet to ratify the move.

<strong>Opec </strong>and its allies agreed a minuscule increase in oil production of <strong>100,000 barrels a day</strong>, just 0.1% of global demand. The cartel’s decision will disappoint America’s president, Joe Biden, and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron. Both leaders have in recent weeks [met with the crown prince](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/28/how-to-deal-with-despots) of <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>, Muhammad bin Salman, to persuade the [giant petrostate](https://www.economist.com/business/why-saudi-aramco-could-be-eclipsed-by-its-qatari-nemesis/21808310) to pump more oil to lower global energy prices.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

Parts of the<strong> Great Barrier Reef</strong> in Australia have the highest level of <strong>coral cover</strong> in 36 years, according to a long-term monitoring programme. In about two-thirds of the reef, coral cover exceeded more than 30%, the level considered healthy. But scientists warned that the reef remains vulnerable to both man-made threats, such as bleaching, and natural ones, like infestations of crown-of-thorns starfish. 

<strong>China</strong> announced plans to build several [ultra-high-voltage power transmission lines](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/01/14/chinas-embrace-of-a-new-electricity-transmission-technology-holds-lessons-for-others) that will allow it to deliver clean power across the country. State Grid Corporation, the world’s largest utility, said it would begin work on the $22bn project by the end of the year. The lines will connect big cities to regions in the west where hydropower, solar and wind plants are located.

Eleven professional <strong>golfers</strong> sued the PGA Tour, alleging the organisation violated American <strong>antitrust</strong> law when it suspended them from its tournaments after they [joined a rival circuit](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/06/17/will-signing-stars-like-phil-mickelson-bring-success-to-liv-golf) financed by Saudi Arabia. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in California, contends that the PGA sought to “crush nascent competition before it threatens [its] monopoly”. Last month the Department of Justice launched its own probe into the PGA.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>12.3%, the rate of inflation in Phoenix, Arizona, where prices are growing much faster than in America’s other metropolitan areas.

## Antony Blinken’s Asian tour

America’s top diplomat, Antony Blinken, lands in Cambodia on Wednesday for summits convened by the Association of South-East Asian Nations. ASEAN events are the apogee of form over substance, yet Mr Blinken’s presence speaks to the growing tussle for influence in the poorer parts of the world between America, China and even Russia. His Chinese and Russian counterparts will also attend the conference. 

While in Phnom Penh Mr Blinken will also meet Hun Sen, Cambodia’s long-standing dictator, before flying to Manila to meet [Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/06/29/by-electing-another-marcos-filipinos-show-they-have-forgotten-history), the new president of the Philippines. Yet his trip risks being overshadowed by that of the speaker of America’s House of Representatives, [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/02/nancy-pelosis-trip-to-taiwan-highlights-americas-incoherent-strategy), to Taiwan. Ms Pelosi met President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday. China, aggrieved by Ms Pelosi’s visit, restricted trade with Taiwan and said it would conduct a series of live-fire military drills in the Taiwan Strait later this week. 

## Europe’s economies feel the squeeze

Evidence of [faltering confidence](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/05/14/businesses-in-britain-are-not-as-gloomy-as-consumers-yet) in Europe’s economies keeps trickling in. More came on Wednesday: in June retail-sales volumes in the EU dropped by 1.3% from May and 2.8% year on year. On Monday Germany reported that sales volumes in the [EU’s biggest economy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/04/30/how-would-an-energy-embargo-affect-germanys-economy) had dropped by 8.8% year on year, the steepest annual fall for at least 28 years. In nominal terms German sales declined by 0.8%, illustrating the squeeze of inflation.

Companies are struggling with the slowing demand. An index from S&amp;P Global, a research firm, suggests that in July output in the euro zone contracted for the first time since February 2021. Activity in France and Italy is at 15- and 18- month lows—and in Germany at the lowest for over two years. German GDP didn’t grow at all in the second quarter, even though exports surged in June. And early signs about the third are ominous.

## A divisive funeral for Abe

On Wednesday Japan’s parliament, known as the Diet, started a three-day extraordinary session. Despite growing calls to discuss the state funeral of [Abe Shinzo](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/08/abe-shinzo-the-champion-of-japan), the former prime minister, who was assassinated last month, legislators will do so only once the session is closed. He will be the second prime minister to be granted a state funeral in postwar Japan (the first was Yoshida Shigeru, in 1967).

In office Abe was a divisive figure. His revisionist approach to history, including the downplaying of Japanese atrocities in the second world war, was especially controversial. He remains a polarising figure even in death: a poll by NHK, the state broadcaster, found that only around half of the Japanese favour taxpayers stumping up for his memorial.

Kishida Fumio, Abe’s successor, represents a similarly nationalist, if less contentious, breed of politics. He may be better placed than Abe was [to pursue](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/14/japan-should-stay-true-to-abe-shinzos-vision-up-to-a-point) their party’s policies, such as increasing defence spending and revising the pacifist constitution. But forcing reluctant Japanese to go into mourning may make that harder.

## A sit-in and a stand-off in Iraq

Everyone seems to be digging in. Since July 30th Iraq’s parliament has been [occupied by](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/01/iraqs-parliamentary-plague) supporters of Muqtada al-Sadr, a Shia cleric and politician. They vow to stay until there are changes to the political system, such as shifting Iraq from a parliamentary regime to a presidential one. Mr Sadr’s rivals, meanwhile, have begun organising counter-protests. This week may bring large demonstrations on the streets of Baghdad. Security forces have so far kept the groups apart. But two of Iraq’s most powerful factions are tipping toward conflict.

At issue is who will run the state—and loot it. Mr Sadr’s party won the largest number of seats in a legislative election in October. But he could not muster enough support to form a coalition government that excluded his Shia rivals. He told his MPs to resign, and his opponents have now nominated a candidate for prime minister. Both camps want to control Iraq’s $89bn budget to steer money to their patronage networks and militias. What Mr Sadr could not achieve through politics, he hopes to take by force.

## Lights, camera, acción: filming in Mexico

“My curse didn’t start in a Mayan temple…” begins the trailer for “¿Qué culpa tiene el Karma?” (“Don’t blame Karma”), a Mexican comedy released on Wednesday on Netflix. When her younger sister and high-school crush get engaged, Sara ponders her bad luck. Unlike its protagonist, the movie has had better fortune. The work of Elisa Miller, an award-winning director, it has benefited from Netflix’s decision to pump money into a series of productions in Latin America to compete for the attention of the world’s 500m-plus Spanish speakers. Last year Netflix committed $300m to original content in Mexico alone.

The cash will boost the region’s filmmakers and production companies. It should also help promote its cinema more generally. In Hollywood blockbusters, Hispanic characters are often pigeonholed in storylines about organised crime. Homegrown works have a broader range. And as [streaming services lose subscribers](https://www.economist.com/business/netflix-sheds-subscribers-and-170bn-in-market-value/21808847) elsewhere, they may be hoping to strike gold in Latin America.
