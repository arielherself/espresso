South Korean and Japanese officials said that <strong>North Korea </strong>test-fired an <strong>intercontinental ballistic missile</strong> into the exclusive economic zone off Japan’s western coast. The missile had a range of 15,000km, meaning it could potentially reach America, according to Japan’s defence minister. While North Korea has fired an [unprecedented volley of missiles](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/02/03/what-is-behind-north-koreas-flurry-of-missile-tests) over the past two months, most have been short-range. Observers worry another nuclear test [may be imminent](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/10/18/north-korea-is-preparing-for-another-nuclear-test-or-many). At the sidelines of an APEC summit in Bangkok, America’s vice-president Kamala Harris called an emergency meeting for representatives from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.

<strong>Elon Musk</strong> abruptly closed <strong>Twitter’s</strong> headquarters until Monday, as his unique management style appears to have caused a Twexodus. Staff at the social-media company were given a [“hardcore”](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2022/11/17/the-longer-this-chaos-continues-the-bigger-the-risks-for-twitter-musks-management) ultimatum by the [new owner](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/10/28/elon-musk-buys-twitter-at-last), leaving them the choice between “long hours and high intensity” and a severance package. Hundreds if not thousands are reported to have plumped for the latter.

<strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> is to step down as leader of the Democratic Party in <strong>America’s House of Representatives</strong>, a position she has held since 2003. Ms Pelosi, the first woman to lead either major party in Congress, will continue to serve as a representative for her Californian district. The Republican Party had just [regained control](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/17/in-a-republican-house-investigations-and-fiscal-clashes-loom) of the House; Ms Pelosi’s replacement will lead a minority.

The ruptures at the <strong>Nord Stream gas pipelines</strong> in September were the result of <strong>“grievous sabotage”</strong>, an investigation by Swedish prosecutors concluded. The [controversial pipelines](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/07/14/why-nord-stream-2-is-the-worlds-most-controversial-energy-project) were created to transport natural gas from Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea, but tensions over Ukraine meant Nord Stream 2 was never operational. Prosecutors found traces of explosives, but declined to comment on probable suspects.

<strong>Inflation </strong>in <strong>Japan</strong>, which excludes fresh food, [accelerated](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/08/18/prices-are-rising-in-japan-but-not-wages) to 3.6% year-on-year in October, its highest level since 1982—in a country which has worried more often about[ deflation](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/11/20/the-case-of-the-curiously-quiescent-inflation-rate) in the decades since. That exceeded the Bank of Japan’s target rate of 2%, but has not altered expectations that it will stick to its guns and not hike interest rates, resisting the hawkish winds that have swept round the rest of the world.

The newly installed CEO of <strong>FTX</strong> denounced the “complete failure of corporate controls” and “absence of trustworthy financial information” at the collapsed crypto exchange. In a bankruptcy filing, John Ray described the situation as the worst he had seen in 40 years of overseeing liquidations. [FTX’s implosion](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/17/is-this-the-end-of-crypto) has left behind 1m creditors and triggered several investigations.

<strong>Italy’s Catholic bishops</strong> released the country’s first report documenting cases of clerical<strong> sex abuse</strong>. They also revealed they were researching more than 600 cases on file at the Vatican dating back to 2000. But after decades of inaction, the report itself was [disappointing](https://www.economist.com/international/2022/07/14/catholic-reformers-want-big-changes-to-a-church-marred-by-sex-abuse) in scope. It identified just 89 victims and limited itself to allegations reported to Italian church authorities within the past two years.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> Almost $3trn, the peak market value of all cryptocurrencies last year. Today it is down to $830bn. [Read the full story.](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/17/is-this-the-end-of-crypto)

## COP creeps towards a conclusion

COP27, the UN climate conference held this year in Egypt, is meant to end on Friday. It won’t. Negotiations have stuttered and stalled throughout the two weeks. The first proper draft of the “cover” decision—the document setting out the core agreements made at the summit—did not appear until early on Friday morning, much later than normal. Even then it was a bloated ten pages in which almost everything had yet to be finalised. 

[COPs](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/11/05/what-really-goes-on-during-cop-climate-negotiations) often run into overtime. But this year’s summit is progressing particularly slowly. The biggest dispute is over [“loss-and-damage”](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/03/what-is-climate-loss-and-damage) funding. Poor countries want rich ones to pay them for the harm they have already incurred because of rising temperatures. Late Thursday night the EU, which has traditionally been against the idea, submitted a proposal agreeing to the establishment of such a fund, with caveats. America remains the main antagonist. There is also much debate over whether summiteers should promise to phase down the use of “all [fossil fuels](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/11/17/what-is-the-fossil-fuel-industry-doing-at-cop27)”, strengthening the commitment they made the year before. A long night (or two) stretches ahead.

## Russia’s G20 hangover

On Friday Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, will discuss the “new geopolitical environment” at a meeting in Moscow of the Council of Heads of the Subjects of the Russian Federation, an assembly of regional governors and high-ranking officials. Most governors are fiercely loyal to President Vladimir Putin, and are likely to give Mr Lavrov a warm homecoming after his challenging week representing Russia at the [G20 summit](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/11/13/the-dynamics-of-distrust-around-the-g20-summit) in Bali. (His boss declined an invitation.)

Western leaders at the G20 made clear their fury at Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But Mr Lavrov will be more concerned about subtler rebukes from leaders who have been [more equivocal](https://www.economist.com/international/why-so-much-of-the-world-wont-stand-up-to-russia/21808737). Xi Jinping, China’s president, a crucial ally for Mr Putin, decried the “weaponisation” of food and energy, an apparent reference to the [painful economic consequences](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/08/04/by-how-much-will-the-war-in-ukraine-reduce-global-growth) of the war. Russia’s agreement on Thursday to extend a deal allowing exports of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea could help assuage Mr Xi’s concerns. But patience among Russia’s friends is wearing thin.

## Brazil’s new era of diplomacy

[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/31/lula-will-be-brazils-next-president-now-for-the-hard-part) will not be inaugurated as Brazil’s president—an office he first held nearly 20 years ago—until January 1st. But the new-old president-elect is already on his diplomatic travels. On Wednesday he spoke in Egypt at COP27, the UN’s climate conference. Lula said “Brazil is back” and promised to fight deforestation in the [Amazon rainforest](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/06/23/brazils-amazon-rainforest-has-become-more-dangerous). On Friday he is in Lisbon, at the first bilateral summit between Brazil and Portugal since 2016. 

Lula’s approach to environmental and foreign policy is markedly different from that of Jair Bolsonaro, the right-wing populist he beat in October’s election. Mr Bolsonaro did not attend the previous two COP summits and, on his watch, deforestation in the Amazon spiked by 73% between 2018 and 2021. Whereas Mr Bolsonaro discouraged foreign help to protect the rainforest, Lula has asked for it. That is already paying off: after Lula’s election, Germany and Norway said they would once again contribute to the “Amazon Fund” of money used by Brazil for conservation.

## APEC meets in Bangkok

Asian countries have hosted a trio of summits in recent weeks. After the ASEAN summit, in Cambodia, and the [G20](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/11/13/the-dynamics-of-distrust-around-the-g20-summit), in [Indonesia](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/11/14/indonesia-is-poised-for-a-boom-politics-permitting), comes the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum, in Thailand. During the three-day conference, which continues on Friday, APEC’s 21 members are expected to ratify the “Bangkok Goals”, a plan for climate action. That is welcome. But other worries hang over the proceedings.

The first comes from an unwelcome interruption by North Korea, which apparently launched an intercontinental ballistic missile early on Friday. The countries that fret over its missiles will discuss that on the sidelines. The next is anxiety about the global economy and [rising inflation](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/15/even-a-global-recession-may-not-bring-down-inflation). 

The final worry is whether [America and China](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/11/17/america-and-china-try-to-get-along), the two biggest APEC members, can co-operate in an age of strategic rivalry. China’s president, Xi Jinping, will work the corridors in Bangkok, but America’s president, Joe Biden will not (his vice-president, Kamala Harris, is standing in). “The Asia-Pacific is no one’s backyard, and should not become an arena for a big-power contest,” Mr Xi declared on Thursday. Would that it were so.

## The Weinstein scandal on film

“She Said”, the first major Hollywood film to focus on Hollywood’s most recent big scandal, is released in America on Friday. It stars Zoe Kazan and Carey Mulligan as Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, journalists at the <em>New York Times</em> who in 2017 investigated sexual abuse by Harvey Weinstein, a powerful producer.

The pair’s findings ignited the [#MeToo movement](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2018/09/27/american-politics-after-a-year-of-metoo) and chipped away at the film industry’s institutional [sexism](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/03/01/the-weinstein-scandal-is-changing-hollywood-for-the-better). The director of “She Said”, Maria Schrader, and its screenwriter, Rebecca Lenkiewicz, are both women, which before 2017 would have been unusual for a drama about a newspaper. Their film follows a formula established by “All The President’s Men” (1976), about the <em>Washington Post</em>’s Watergate sleuthing, by chronicling the exhausting, unglamorous work of frustrating phone calls and long editorial meetings. 

This explosive story deserved a less conventional telling. But it makes some sharp feminist points. The two newshounds contend with postnatal depression, bar-room lechers and the school run. Those were never an issue for the men at the <em>Post</em>.
