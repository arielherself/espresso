Rescue teams continued to hunt for survivors from [large earthquakes](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/02/06/massive-earthquakes-in-turkey-and-northern-syria-kill-thousands) that struck southern <strong>Turkey</strong> and <strong>Syria</strong> on Monday. The quakes have already left at least 4,300 people dead. That number looks certain to rise as temperatures dropped below freezing overnight. The World Health Organisation suggested that fatalities could reach 20,000. The initial quake’s epicentre was near the Turkish city of Gaziantep and had a magnitude of 7.8—the strongest in the region since one near Istanbul in 1999 that killed over 17,000 people. A series of aftershocks followed.

<strong>Russia’s</strong> government said its <strong>budget deficit</strong> rose to 1.76trn roubles ($25bn) in January. Revenues from oil-and-gas sales nearly halved from the same period a year ago to 426bn roubles, while defence spending pushed [government outlays](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/02/04/russias-technocrats-keep-funds-flowing-for-vladimir-putins-war) up by 59% year on year, to 3.1trn roubles. Western sanctions mean that Russian crude trades at about $50 a barrel, compared with $80 for Brent.

The <strong>Pentagon</strong> said it had failed to detect previous <strong>Chinese surveillance balloons</strong> in American airspace, discovering them only later through “additional means of [intelligence] collection”. General Glen VanHerck called it an “awareness gap that we have to figure out”. At least four other intrusions had occurred in recent years before [last month’s](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/02/03/how-a-balloon-burst-sino-american-talks). America said it would not return the debris from the destroyed balloon to China.

Alphabet, the parent company of <strong>Google</strong>, unveiled Bard, a [chatbot powered by artificial intelligence](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/30/the-race-of-the-ai-labs-heats-up). It will rival <strong>ChatGPT,</strong> a popular Microsoft-backed venture that generates text, images and video that seem as though they are created by humans. Various firms plan to add similar technology, including Baidu, a Chinese search giant. Bard will be tested on some users before a full launch in the coming weeks.

The share price of some <strong>Adani Group</strong> companies rose on Tuesday, after suffering another miserable day on Monday. The value of the Indian conglomerate has now fallen by more than $100bn in two weeks. The sell-off started after [<strong>Hindenburg Research</strong>](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/02/hindenburg-research-attacker-of-the-adani-empire), an American short-seller, made [allegations of fraud](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/01/what-next-for-gautam-adanis-embattled-empire). Hundreds of protesters took to the streets in Delhi and other Indian cities on Monday, amid growing calls to investigate the allegations.

The UN warned that about 1m <strong>Tibetan</strong> children have been sent to<strong> Chinese</strong> boarding schools seemingly under a government policy to [assimilate them](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/09/13/chinas-government-is-mass-collecting-dna-from-tibetans) into majority Han culture. Instruction is only in Mandarin, making it difficult for Tibetan children to communicate with family in their native language and contributing to the “erosion” of their identity, said three UN special rapporteurs.

The <strong>Premier League</strong> accused <strong>Manchester City</strong>, one of [English football’s](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/09/02/footballs-transfer-window-shows-the-premier-leagues-growing-clout) most successful teams in recent years, of more than 100 breaches of its financial rules. Investigators said the club failed to provide accurate information about its revenues and flouted “financial fair play” rules, which limit a club’s permitted losses. Since its takeover by Abu Dhabi United Group in 2008, City have spent more than €2.1bn ($2.3bn) on players.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 1.2m, the number of fishing licences sold in the state of Minnesota in 2020—roughly one for every five residents. [Read the full story.](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/02/02/the-sport-of-ice-fishing-is-being-transformed-by-technology)

## A transatlantic discussion on green subsidies

Margrethe Vestager’s early career was so impressive that it inspired [“Borgen”](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/05/14/borgen-returns-after-a-decade-to-a-pessimistic-europe), a hit television show about [Danish](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2012/12/19/taking-over-the-world) politics. Now, as the competition boss of the [European Commission](https://www.economist.com/charlemagnes-notebook/2019/05/28/why-margrethe-vestager-ticks-all-the-boxes), Ms Vestager wields one of the EU’s sharpest economic swords: fierce competition rules and their enforcement.  
  
 Those weapons curb corporate power and egregious state support used to prop up national champions. But many EU governments, in particular the French, would like to blunt Ms Vestager’s sword. They argue that the American government’s ambitious (and [expensive](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/02/02/americas-government-is-spending-lavishly-to-revive-manufacturing)) plans to build up green manufacturing require Europe to respond in kind: with large subsidies. No doubt to Ms Vestager’s dismay, the EU’s new green industrial strategy weakens Europe&#x27;s competition rules and allows governments to spend more lavishly. 

On Monday Ms Vestager will speak to America’s treasury secretary, Janet Yellen—who oversees the tax credits that form the backbone of America’s ambitions—in an attempt to limit the transatlantic fallout over subsidies. Not quite the stuff of noirish Scandinavian drama, but important for Europe’s economic future.

## The UN’s priorities for 2023

When preparing a setlist, musicians must give the crowd fresh material as well as old classics. António Guterres, the UN’s secretary-general, faces a similar challenge when he outlines his priorities for 2023 before the General Assembly on Monday. 

Mr Guterres is fond of grim proclamations: in recent months he has warned of “nuclear annihilation” and “climate hell”. Expect to hear such refrains again as he warns of the risks posed by Russia’s war in Ukraine, spiralling inflation and rising temperatures. 

But he should also offer something new. Watch out for mention of the UN’s [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.economist.com/international/2015/03/26/unsustainable-goals), 17 targets for 2030 that cover everything from peace to renewable energy. Progress is assessed every four years: the next stocktake is scheduled for September. Mr Guterres will probably warn governments to pick up the tempo. Otherwise he will be forced to carry on singing the same tune.

## India’s central bank meets

On Monday India’s central bankers begin a three-day monetary-policy meeting at which they are expected to announce a small increase in interest rates. That will probably be the final rise in the current tightening cycle. The Reserve Bank of India is softening its stance because price rises are slowing. In December annual inflation fell for the third consecutive month, to 5.7%, its lowest level in more than a year. In last week’s budget the government announced plans to rein in spending, which should also help keep prices down. 

But as one fire fizzles, another looms. Several of India’s largest banks are exposed to the [Adani Group](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/01/what-next-for-gautam-adanis-embattled-empire), the giant conglomerate that has been rocked by allegations of fraud. The RBI insists the “banking sector remains resilient and stable”. Commercial banks have also played down any concerns. But should the fallout worsen, the RBI, which has a mandate for maintaining financial stability, may be back firefighting.

## Anglicans debate same-sex marriage

Gay marriage was legalised in Britain in 2014. But no religious organisation can be compelled to carry out same-sex weddings. When the Church of England’s governing body, the general synod, convenes on Monday for a four-day session, the issue will be at the top of the agenda. In January the church said it planned to allow clergy to bless same-sex unions but would continue to ban gay couples from marrying in its churches. When the synod debates the proposal this week, progressives may push for that ban to be lifted.

The church’s membership seems to be coming around to the idea. Some 55%, and almost three-quarters of those under 50, support same-sex marriage, up from 38% in 2013. But Anglicans elsewhere in the world are [less liberal](https://www.economist.com/britain/2016/01/15/justin-welby-just-about-manages-to-hold-together-the-anglican-communion). In August 2022 the Global South Fellowship of Anglican Churches, which represents around 75% of Anglicans worldwide, reaffirmed its view that homosexuality is “incompatible with scripture.” The Church of England risks [destabilising](https://www.economist.com/britain/2016/01/15/justin-welby-just-about-manages-to-hold-together-the-anglican-communion) the Anglican Communion entirely.

## Marvel films return to China

Chinese cinephiles will line up this week for the country’s first showings of “Wakanda Forever”, Disney’s Oscar-nominated follow-up to “Black Panther”. The studio’s Marvel superhero flicks have a big following [in China](https://www.economist.com/china/2019/05/02/avengers-endgame-has-been-an-unusual-hit-in-china). “Wakanda” is especially eagerly awaited, as it is the first Marvel movie to be granted a release in China since 2019.

No one is sure why China banned the previous lot. The content may be one reason. In 2021 “The Eternals” introduced Marvel’s first gay superhero. “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings”, also released in 2021, depicted Asian culture in ways that may have triggered China’s censors. Neither was shown in China.

A bigger motive may have been to protect domestic moviemakers. Patriotic hits like [“The Battle at Lake Changjin”](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/01/22/how-chinese-propaganda-films-became-watchable) do better when Disney is shut out. No reason was given for Marvel&#x27;s sudden return. But a population that has become restless with covid clampdowns needs [cheering up](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/01/25/china-is-trying-to-win-over-westerners-and-private-firms). Not bread and circuses, but bread and cinema.
