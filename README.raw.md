The [death toll](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/02/06/massive-earthquakes-in-turkey-and-northern-syria-kill-thousands) from the <strong>earthquakes</strong> in <strong>Turkey</strong> and <strong>Syria</strong> on Monday surpassed 20,000. Turkey’s president, <strong>Recep Tayyip Erdogan</strong>, acknowledged that there were problems with his government’s response. Many Turks have complained that state rescue teams lacked expertise and appropriate equipment, and that they were slow to arrive, even though people remain trapped under rubble.

<strong>Ukraine’s </strong>president, Volodymyr Zelensky, arrived in Brussels to address the European Parliament. During his speech he thanked European leaders for their support and reiterated Ukraine’s desire to [join the bloc](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/02/03/ukraine-is-not-about-to-join-the-eu). On a surprise trip to London and Paris on Wednesday Mr Zelensky repeated his calls for the West to provide [fighter jets](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/02/01/why-does-ukraine-want-western-jets-and-will-it-get-them) to his country. Western allies have so far refused to send warplanes.

Nelson Peltz, an activist investor, said that his proxy fight with <strong>Disney </strong>had ended after Bob Igner, the company’s chief executive, unveiled a large [restructuring programme](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/02/08/disney-will-cut-7000-jobs-as-it-restructures-its-business) that included 7,000 lay-offs. Mr Peltz had criticised Disney’s corporate governance before his firm, Trian, launched the proxy fight in January. He said that Disney now plans to do “everything” he had envisaged.

The State Department said that the <strong>Chinese balloon</strong> shot down over the Atlantic on Saturday was part of a sophisticated network of similar surveillance devices which [China](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/02/07/the-lessons-from-the-chinese-spy-balloon) has operated over more than 40 countries across five continents. The department also said America was “confident” the [balloon](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/02/04/the-sino-american-rivalry-needs-guardrails-to-contain-small-incidents) was made by a firm with direct links to China’s military.

Annual inflation in <strong>Germany</strong> fell in January, which may demand a revision of euro-zone inflation figures released last week. The publication of Germany’s data had been delayed due to technical issues. Germany’s harmonised index of consumer prices dropped from 9.6% in December to 9.2% last month; economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise to 10%.

<strong>Credit Suisse</strong> recorded its largest loss since the financial crisis in 2008 as it struggled to restore confidence after a series of social-media [rumours](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/03/credit-suisse-and-the-hunt-for-the-weakest-link-in-global-finance) questioning its liquidity and capital position emerged last year. The Swiss bank reported a loss of SFr1.4bn ($1.5bn) as both its investment banking and wealth management business suffered. That took its annual loss to SFr7.3bn.

<strong>Meta</strong> restored <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> Facebook and Instagram accounts, which were [suspended](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/05/06/facebooks-oversight-board-says-that-donald-trump-can-be-kept-off-the-platform-for-now) shortly after the Capitol insurrection on January 6th 2021. Earlier the social-media firm announced its decision to reinstate the former president’s accounts, concluding that his threat to public safety had “sufficiently receded”. Twitter restored Mr Trump’s account in November, but it has sat idle.

## Zelensky goes to Brussels

Leaders of the European Union’s 27 member states will convene in Brussels on Thursday. President Volodymyr Zelensky, who would dearly like Ukraine to become the [bloc’s 28th member](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/02/03/ukraine-is-not-about-to-join-the-eu), has made a rare in-person visit and addressed the European Parliament. On Wednesday he made unexpected trips to London and Paris. 

For their tenth meeting in under a year European leaders will discuss how to keep [aiding Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/12/who-is-doing-most-to-help-ukraine-against-russia) with weapons, cash and—one day—EU accession. Then they will [squabble over migration](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/11/17/a-new-migration-crisis-is-brewing-in-europe). A surge in arrivals has prompted some countries, most recently Bulgaria, to demand the bloc build more fences around its outer borders. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, among others, feels that is rather too Trumpian. The EU also needs to agree on how to respond to the [giant green subsidies](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/02/02/americas-government-is-spending-lavishly-to-revive-manufacturing) recently enacted by America. Fighting them with European ones is one possibility, but might undermine the EU&#x27;s vaunted single market.

## Adani Enterprises reports its earnings

On Thursday Adani Enterprises will report its results for the last quarter of 2022. It will be its first earnings call since Hindenburg Research criticised the finances of the Adani Group, of which Adani Enterprises is a part. The Indian conglomerate has forcefully denied Hindenburg’s allegations.

Adani will undoubtedly use the event to try to reassure investors. On Monday it announced that it would repay 19 months ahead of schedule a $1.1bn loan that was taken out using shares in some of the group’s companies as collateral. (It was later reported that it had faced a margin call for $500m.) Yet shares in some of the group’s companies continue to gyrate. The market value of the Adani Group has fallen by about half since the report; its founder, [Gautam Adani](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/01/31/who-is-gautam-adani), has lost billions. 

India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has been silent about the trials of Mr Adani, a close associate, and of his company, which plays a big role in India’s infrastructure. Regulators are said to have asked Adani for information related to Hindenburg’s claims. But it seems unlikely that Hindenburg’s allegations will be proven or dispelled any time soon.

## ​​Big changes at Japanese carmakers

Quarterly earnings reports of Japanese carmakers tend to be demure affairs. But on Thursday Toyota and Nissan, Japan’s first- and third-largest auto manufacturers, announced their results amid an air of drama. Toyota reported a surprise 22% rise in operating profit in the third quarter of 2022; Nissan’s profits more than doubled in the same period.

Both firms recently announced big internal changes. Toyota replaced its long-time chief executive (and grandson of the firm’s founder), Toyoda Akio, with Sato Koji (pictured), its chief branding officer and head of Lexus, its luxury label. On Monday Nissan announced that it would [restructure its alliance](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/02/an-alliance-between-renault-and-nissan-gets-a-reboot) with Renault, a French carmaker, so that the firms’ stakes in each other are equalised. 

Both moves are intended to help the two companies deal with the changing road conditions of the modern car industry. Toyota has been a laggard on [electric vehicles](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/02/chinas-byd-is-overtaking-tesla-as-the-carmaker-extraordinaire) under Mr Toyoda. And the marriage between Nissan and Renault had long been unhappy.

## The state of South Africa

Cyril Ramaphosa’s annual state-of-the-nation speeches have tended to follow a pattern. South Africa’s president, in power since replacing Jacob Zuma in 2018, tells parliament that he will fix various problems: [power cuts](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/02/02/south-africas-blackouts-hurt-the-economy-in-unexpected-ways), joblessness, investment-depleting red tape and so on. Then, as a result of his own timidity, his rancorous ruling party (the African National Congress) and a weak bureaucracy, he does [little or nothing](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/12/15/how-to-save-south-africa) about them. [Blackouts](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/02/02/south-africas-blackouts-hurt-the-economy-in-unexpected-ways) in South Africa were worse last year than any on record; the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high, at 33%.

So when Mr Ramaphosa gives his latest address in Cape Town on Thursday, he will speak to a deeply sceptical nation. He will pledge—again—to overhaul [Eskom](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/14/the-man-with-a-plan-to-fix-eskom), the state-owned energy utility. A cabinet reshuffle is in the works. But South Africans are tired of homilies from a president who has tarnished his own reformist [credentials](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/13/the-party-of-nelson-mandela-is-imploding). The country is in a hole. To get out, it needs more than words.

## Rushdie returns triumphant with new book

At the end of Salman Rushdie’s “Victory City”, the author’s 15th novel, a magical storyteller proclaims that while regimes fall, stories survive. “Words are the only victors.” Few writers embody the spirit of that claim as powerfully as Sir Salman. The [Bombay-born author](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2022/08/16/an-introduction-to-the-works-of-salman-rushdie) of “Midnight’s Children” and “The Satanic Verses” finished his fable a few months before an attacker [stabbed](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/18/salman-rushdie-and-the-struggle-for-free-speech) him in August 2022, leaving him blind in one eye and without the full use of one hand.

His latest book, published this week, is a historical chronicle of the Vijayanagar empire of southern India that talks about the power of narrative art to prevail over violence and hatred. Its heroine, a poet-queen, conjures a fabulous realm into existence. Fantasy and history converge. Sir Salman, who is still recovering from the attack, will not appear at promotional events. Still, the [champion of free-spirited fiction](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/08/15/salman-rushdie-is-a-champion-of-imagination-ambiguity-and-liberty), who withstood both an Iranian <em>fatwa</em> and a violent assault, claims the last, triumphant word.
