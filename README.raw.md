Both Russian and Ukrainian reports suggested that the town of <strong>Izyum</strong> had fallen to advancing Ukrainian troops. This followed the fall of a crucial railway interchange at Kupyansk, as a counter-offensive in the <strong>Kharkiv region</strong> continued at pace. Russia’s defence ministry unconvincingly claimed that the retreat by Russian forces was an attempt to “regroup”. Earlier Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, celebrated recent [progress](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/08/29/ukraine-starts-a-push-to-recapture-kherson-a-crucial-russian-occupied-city), saying that 1,000 square kilometres of Ukrainian territory and “dozens of settlements” had already been [reclaimed](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/04/ukraine-is-losing-fewer-soldiers-in-its-counter-offensive-than-russia-claims) since September 1st, mostly in the east. 

The <strong>Accession Council</strong>, a group of senior officials and politicians that convenes [following the death of a monarch](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/10/22/british-royal-succession-queen-elizabeth), formally proclaimed Charles III king on Saturday morning. King Charles delivered his first address as monarch on Friday evening. He honoured the life and service of Queen Elizabeth II and pledged to follow his mother’s example [throughout his reign](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/09/what-will-charles-do-now). He said he would step back from some of his charitable duties and announced the elevation of his son, William, as Prince of Wales.

Britons entered their second day of <strong>national mourning </strong>following the death of <strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong>, while tributes poured in from foreign leaders. The queen [died](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2022/09/08/elizabeth-ii-never-laid-down-the-heavy-weight-of-the-crown) on Thursday, aged 96, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. Britain’s [oldest and longest-reigning monarch](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/08/the-death-of-elizabeth-ii-marks-the-end-of-an-era) acceded to the throne in 1952 and led Britain, and the Commonwealth, through a [period of intense change](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/09/08/britains-longest-serving-ruler-strengthened-the-monarchy). Her funeral is likely to take place on September 19th. Parliament is to convene on Saturday, to approve a message of condolence to the king.

Different views emerged between the Department of Justice and <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> legal team over the appointment of a “<strong>special master</strong>”. The independent third party is supposed to review documents seized by the FBI at the former president’s [Mar-a-Lago](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/09/an-fbi-raid-on-donald-trumps-home-ignites-a-political-firestorm) estate in August. The two parties set out a selection of their preferred candidates for the role and will disclose their opinions on each other’s choices on Monday. 

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

American lawmakers warned <strong>Apple </strong>it will encounter significant political pressure if it uses chips from <strong>China’s</strong> Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. in its products. Marco Rubio, the Republican vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, told the <em>Financial Times</em> that “Apple is playing with fire”. His criticism follows the recent passing of the [CHIPS act](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/29/america-takes-on-china-with-a-giant-microchips-bill), an attempt to bolster America’s position in the semiconductor industry.

The <strong>World Bank</strong> put the cost of [rebuilding](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/04/16/what-will-it-cost-to-rebuild-ukraine) <strong>Ukraine</strong> at $349bn—more than one and a half times the country’s GDP last year. In the short term, the bank said, $105bn would be required to prepare for the coming winter and planting season and to repair transport systems, among other necessities. The number of Ukrainians in poverty, or those living on less than $5.50 a day, is projected to rise tenfold, to about a fifth of the population.

<strong>Mexico’s</strong> senate voted to put the civilian-led national guard under the control of the defence ministry. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador had agitated for the controversial change, which human-rights advocates say will reduce transparency and [militarise law enforcement](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2021/04/29/mexicos-president-is-giving-the-armed-forces-new-powers). The UN criticised the proposal, saying that police “should be subordinate to civilian authorities”.

## Ukraine punches back

The war took a [dramatic turn](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/08/ukraines-army-pierces-russian-lines-near-kharkiv) this week when Ukraine launched a fresh assault in the east of the country, on top of its week-old [offensive in the southern province of Kherson](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/08/29/ukraine-starts-a-push-to-recapture-kherson-a-crucial-russian-occupied-city). On Tuesday Ukrainian tanks and troops sliced through a weak spot in Russian lines east of the city of Kharkiv. In the following days they encircled the town of Balakliya and moved 50km east—marking one of the most rapid advances seen since Russia invaded in February. 

Ukrainian forces took the key rail junction at Kupyansk on Saturday and reports suggest they also liberated Izyum nearby. Russia claims that the collapse of its line represents a “regroup” before launching a new attack further south in Donetsk province. But Russian military bloggers tracking the war describe panic and confusion. On Thursday Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said that his armies had liberated 1,000 square kilometres in the north-eastern Kharkiv province as well as the southern Kherson province, where progress has been slower.

## Canada’s Conservatives to pick a polite populist

On Saturday it is the turn of Canada’s Conservative Party to choose a new leader. The favourite is [Pierre Poilievre](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/06/09/canadas-trump-is-politer-than-the-real-thing), a boyish member of Parliament. His take-no-prisoners, Trumpian style helped the party quadruple its membership since the end of 2021.

Though his populist combativeness may win him the leadership, it will be a harder sell with Canadians at large. Most feel there is too much nasty partisanship in politics. Yet it is wrong to pigeonhole Mr Poilievre as a hard right-winger. Though he supported the [trucker convoy](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/02/07/will-ottawas-state-of-emergency-quell-protests-against-vaccine-mandates) that paralysed Canada’s capital in February, he doesn’t pander to social conservatives. He says that he will not restrict access to abortion and that life should be made easier for immigrants.

His first order of business will be keeping a diffuse caucus intact. Some moderate Conservatives are talking of splintering off to occupy a middle ground that many feel Canada’s Liberals, under Justin Trudeau, the prime minister, has abandoned by allying themselves with the left-leaning New Democrats. A big job awaits.

## What to expect from Charles III

[King Charles III](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/09/what-will-charles-do-now) has had decades to prepare for accession to the British throne, which will be formally proclaimed by the so-called Accession Council on Saturday morning. Yet despite that run-up, no one really knows what his reign will mean for the royal family, or for Britain. For kings, like stocks, past success is no guide to future performance. [The queen’s reign epitomised stability](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2022/09/08/elizabeth-ii-never-laid-down-the-heavy-weight-of-the-crown): everything about her, from her low-heeled loafers to her restrained emotions, showed a striking consistency. 

In some ways Charles will be a [continuation](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/10/22/british-royal-succession-queen-elizabeth) of this. His emotions, however, are more mercurial and, for the monarchy, often far too close to the surface. He has complained in particular about his childhood, earning him the moniker “Prince of Wails”. Charles may also make more political noise than did his [scrupulously neutral mother](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/09/08/britains-longest-serving-ruler-strengthened-the-monarchy). He is already notorious for pushing his many opinions, on everything from modern architecture to industrial farming. But as king, he must know that his success will be judged by the yardstick of [hospital visits and school openings](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/08/how-britain-has-changed-since-elizabeth-ii-was-crowned-in-1953). In this, he is likely to excel. Previous heirs to the British throne were wayward or drunken; close aides say Charles works “like a Trojan”.

## Can Bollywood escape its funk?

This is a big weekend for [Bollywood](https://www.economist.com/business/2018/10/20/bollywood-helps-inspire-a-boom-in-indian-domestic-tourism), India’s Hindi-film industry. On Friday “Brahmastra: Part One—Shiva”, a mythological-adventure flick, was released in 5,000 theatres across the country, amid much hype and some trepidation. Excitement was sparked by a budget of more than $50m, making the film one of the most expensive ever produced in India, and the promise of a potentially lucrative franchise (already dubbed the “astraverse”) to follow. 

The nerves come from [Bollywood’s recent struggles](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/02/25/the-siege-of-bollywood). According to an industry tracker, of 26 releases this year, 20 have been flops, losing at least half of their investment. Before the pandemic, box-office revenues had been increasing steadily. But lockdowns weaned [Indians away from the cinemas](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2021/12/18/indias-touring-cinemas-are-dying-and-being-reborn) and onto streaming services, where they have largely stayed. Bollywood now hopes to lure back viewers with big hits. “Brahmastra” could be just that, as early data suggests bumper ticket sales, potentially the highest in three years.

## Weekend profile: Shavkat Mirziyoyev, Uzbek leader with a reformist bent

When Shavkat Mirziyoyev became president of Uzbekistan in 2016, his country was a pariah in much of the democratic world. Previously Central Asia’s most populous nation had been ruled by Islam Karimov, a ruthless despot who clung to power through the Soviet Union’s collapse and his country’s independence in 1991. Although Karimov earned some goodwill among Western governments for helping military operations in neighbouring Afghanistan after 2001, that soon evaporated amid persistent allegations of corruption and rights abuses, including boiling dissidents alive and massacring anti-government protesters in the city Andijan in 2005. He even locked up his own daughter, once considered a successor. 

In the six years since Mr Mirziyoyev’s ascent, Uzbekistan has undergone a [striking transformation](https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/10/23/uzbekistans-president-abolished-slave-labour-what-next). He has eased state controls on industry, media, religion and civil society, and [abolished a forced-labour system](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/03/05/uzbekistan-has-succeeded-in-abolishing-forced-labour) for picking cotton, a major export. He has also overseen a diplomatic shift, improving ties with neighbours, [expanding links with China](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/09/06/two-new-railway-lines-could-transform-central-asia) and repairing relations with the West. Since America’s withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, he has taken a lead in engaging the Taliban and in lobbying Western countries to follow suit. He will build on that legacy next week by hosting a summit of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, a grouping of regional powers, in the Uzbek city of Samarkand. For China’s president, Xi Jinping, it will be the [first foreign foray in two years](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/09/08/xi-jinping-will-at-last-venture-abroad-again).

Some question Mr Mirziyoyev’s reformist credentials. He was, after all, Karimov’s prime minister for 13 years and maintains many restrictions on religion, media and civil activism. Election monitors have flagged concerns about his two presidential victories, while acknowledging progress towards fairness. In July Amnesty International called for an investigation into reports that his troops had used “unlawful force” in quelling protests against plans to change the constitutional status of Karakalpakstan, an autonomous region. Eighteen protesters died and Mr Mirziyoyev withdrew the proposal. Yet even critics acknowledge that he has revitalised the economy: it now rivals neighbouring Kazakhstan’s as the region’s most dynamic. Mr Mirziyoyev is no model liberal. But in a region long stifled by Soviet-era strongmen, he is still a breath of fresh air.
