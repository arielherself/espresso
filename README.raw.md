<strong>Rishi Sunak </strong>officially became prime minister of Britain—the third this year—after meeting with King Charles III. He promised to “unite our country not with words but with action” and to fix “some mistakes” made by Liz Truss, his predecessor and Britain’s [shortest-serving](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/20/liz-truss-is-britains-shortest-serving-prime-minister) prime minister. As Mr Sunak assembles his new cabinet, he has reappointed the chancellor, [Jeremy Hunt](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/10/18/how-jeremy-hunt-became-the-most-powerful-person-in-britain), who reversed most of Ms Truss’s disastrous “mini-budget”. The pound rallied and the yields on 30-year government bonds fell to levels before plans for unfunded tax cuts rattled markets.

<strong>Russia </strong>redoubled its warnings about <strong>Ukraine </strong>supposedly preparing to use a “<strong>dirty bomb</strong>”—a [radiation-dispersing](https://www.economist.com/international/2013/12/14/glowing-in-the-dark) explosive—and said it would raise them before the UN Security Council on Tuesday. Western governments had already denounced Russia’s alarm as a pretext for its [next escalation](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/06/02/a-new-nuclear-era). The UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency said it would send inspectors to look at two Ukrainian nuclear sites, at Ukraine’s invitation.

<strong>Alphabet </strong>reported lower-than-expected quarterly results. Revenues at Google’s parent company rose by 6% year over year, to $69.1bn. That is its slowest growth rate in more than two years and comes amid a pullback in digital-ad spending. Ad sales at YouTube, its video-sharing platform, declined compared with the same period in 2021. <strong>Microsoft’s</strong> revenues grew by nearly 11%, to $50bn, though sales at its [cloud-computing unit](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/08/29/the-cloud-computing-giants-are-vying-to-protect-fat-profits) slightly missed expectations.

A Russian court upheld a nine-year jail sentence for <strong>Brittney Griner</strong>, an American basketball player convicted of drug possession and smuggling. The two-time Olympic gold medallist has been detained since February when cannabis oil was found in her luggage, which she called an “honest mistake”. The Biden administration has [unsuccessfully pushed](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/05/how-do-prisoner-swaps-work) for Ms Griner’s release; she is now bound for a distant Russian penal colony.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>House-price</strong> growth in <strong>America</strong> decelerated in August at its fastest pace since tracking started in 1987, according to the Case-Shiller home-price index. Prices rose by 13% in the year through August, down from July’s year-over-year growth of 15.6%. The Federal Reserve’s continuing interest-rate rises are likely to [dent price growth](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/20/a-global-house-price-slump-is-coming) even more, as mortgage financing becomes more expensive.

<strong>Jamie Dimon</strong>, the boss of JPMorgan Chase, said he believes that <strong>America </strong>and <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> will “remain allies” despite recent tensions. Mr Dimon is currently in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia’s capital, for the Future Investment Initiative conference. American bankers have flocked to “Davos in the desert” but officials from the Biden administration are notably absent amid a continued spat over [oil production](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/05/opec-defies-joe-biden-with-a-big-output-cut).

<strong>HSBC</strong> named Georges Elhedery as its new chief financial officer, causing speculation that he will eventually replace [Noel Quinn](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/08/08/the-surprising-departure-of-hsbcs-chief-executive), the chief executive. Europe’s largest bank also reported a bump in quarterly profits on the back of rising global interest rates. Its net interest income increased by a third to $8.6bn from July to September and pre-tax profit, at $6.5bn, beat expectations.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>300,000, the number of paintings Steve Keene, an American artist, estimates to have sold or donated since the early 1990s. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/10/24/steve-keenes-art-caters-for-the-many-not-the-few).

## Germany marshals a recovery for Ukraine

[Dithering](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/05/31/olaf-scholzs-dithering-is-damaging-germanys-international-image) over delivering arms to Ukraine has damaged Germany’s international image. But the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, seems to [have got with the programme](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/11/thanks-to-vladimir-putin-germany-has-woken-up). Keen to show that Germany, currently the president of the G7, is pulling its weight on other fronts, he is co-hosting an international conference in Berlin on Tuesday on the recovery, reconstruction and modernisation of Ukraine.

Mr Scholz and his fellow host, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, have worked closely with Ukraine’s government. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, is attending the summit in person. The idea is to conceive a Marshall Plan for Ukraine—a “generational task” that must start now, according to the summiteers, even though the war grinds on.

Mr Shmyhal demands that frozen Russian assets, worth up to $500bn, be used to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine, which is projected to cost at least $350bn. He argues that the prospect of footing the bill for inflicted damage could serve as a deterrent to potential future aggressors.

## Pennsylvania’s one Senate debate

[John Fetterman](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/09/29/john-fetterman-is-a-canny-politician) and Mehmet Oz, the Democratic and Republican nominees for Pennsylvania’s open Senate seat, [square off](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/09/mehmet-oz-and-john-fetterman-square-off-in-pennsylvania) on Tuesday in what is likely to be their only debate. Back when he was trailing badly in the polls, Mr Oz—who is at ease before the cameras after years of television appearances—had been pushing for five debates. But Mr Fetterman agreed to just this one, held well after the start of early voting.

Mr Fetterman has never been a strong debater, but voters will be watching him keenly tonight. He suffered a stroke in May, and although his doctor says he’s “recovering well” and can “work full duty in public office”, he also still shows “symptoms of an auditory-processing disorder”, and will use closed captioning during the debate. Mr Fetterman’s wide polling lead from earlier this autumn has all but vanished: the two candidates are neck-and-neck. And the outcome of this race matters—it could determine control of the Senate.

## A spooky week for Big Tech

Alphabet and Microsoft will kick off a nervous earnings quarter for tech firms when they report their latest results on Tuesday. Tech enjoyed a stellar 2021 as covid forced people to go online to work, shop and play. This year it has fallen back to Earth. Inflation, war and broken supply chains have darkened the economic outlook. A [strong dollar](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/08/why-the-dollar-is-strong-and-why-that-is-a-problem) has made things harder still for American exporters. Most of [Silicon Valley](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/06/28/the-great-silicon-valley-shake-out) is freezing recruitment and trimming budgets.

Last week Snap spooked markets when it reported wilting demand for digital advertising on Snapchat, its social-media app. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, relies on ads too, though its business has so far proved more resilient. Microsoft has a strong cloud-computing division but must reckon with falling PC sales. Later this week Amazon, Apple and Meta will also announce their earnings. For some anxious investors, it feels as if Halloween is coming early.

## What’s the plan for Italy?

Italy’s new prime minister, [Giorgia Meloni](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/22/how-afraid-should-europe-be-of-giorgia-meloni), unveiled [her government’s ](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/22/giorgia-meloni-and-her-allies-take-power-in-italy)programme in parliament on Tuesday amid continued grumbling by one of her [coalition partners](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/20/italys-coalition-building-runs-into-trouble). After weeks of negotiations, Silvio Berlusconi, the leader of Forza Italia, who is on trial for allegedly bribing witnesses, was denied control of the justice ministry. Ms Meloni’s high-handedness has “prompted disappointment” said Giorgio Mulé, a leading figure in Mr Berlusconi’s party.

Ms Meloni’s cabinet, which she named on Saturday, reflects the rigorously conservative concerns of her Brothers of Italy party. Eugenia Maria Roccella, the minister for equal opportunities, for example, will also be responsible for boosting Italy’s birth rate. The prime minister is more conventional with her pro-NATO foreign policy, though it remains to be seen how confrontational her nationalist coalition will be towards the EU. And questions remain as to how radical the government’s social and financial policies will be.

## Guillermo del Toro’s monster mash

From “Pan’s Labyrinth” to “[The Shape Of Water](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2018/02/13/sculpting-a-romantic-lead-for-the-shape-of-water)” (winner of the Oscar for Best Picture in 2018), almost every film made by Guillermo del Toro has featured supernatural monsters. Crawling with them, too, is his eight-part Netflix anthology, which has its premiere on Tuesday. Two standalone tales will be released daily. Each hour-long episode of “Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet Of Curiosities” is adapted from a short horror story: two of these stories were written by the Mexican film-maker himself and two by H.P. Lovecraft, an American author.

Each episode has a different director and a different setting in 20th-century America. All have lavish production design, and all have slimy, fanged, tentacle-waggling creatures, several of which were co-designed by Mr del Toro. These cheerfully old-fashioned shockers offer ghoulish Halloween entertainment that is both eclectic and archetypal—featuring plenty of gore, creepy soundtracks and, of course, monsters galore.
