<strong>Joe Biden</strong>, America’s president, warned of “Armageddon”, if Russia were to use [tactical nuclear bombs](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/14/do-russias-military-setbacks-increase-the-risk-of-nuclear-conflict) in an attempt to turn around its fortunes in Ukraine. Mr Biden said he believed that Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, was “not joking” about nuclear threats. Russia’s recent pounding on the battlefield has prompted rare public criticisms, including from Kirill Stremousov, the Russian-appointed deputy governor of the [annexed](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/05/russias-annexations-in-ukraine-are-a-legal-and-strategic-mess) province of Kherson. He called Russia’s military leaders “incompetent”.

This year’s <strong>Nobel peace prize</strong> was awarded to one individual and two organisations fighting authoritarianism in the post-Soviet region. The prize was shared between Ales Bialiatski, a Belarusian pro-democracy activist, Memorial, one of Russia’s oldest human rights organisations, [long hounded by the Kremlin](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/01/01/memorial-a-seminal-human-rights-group-in-russia), and the Centre for Civil Liberties, a Ukrainian human rights group that has documented war crimes since Russia’s invasion.

<strong>Credit</strong><strong> Suisse</strong> said it would buy back up to $3bn of its own debt in a bid to reassure investors [amid persistent concerns](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/03/credit-suisse-and-the-hunt-for-the-weakest-link-in-global-finance) about its liquidity. Before the announcement shares in the Swiss bank had fallen 55% this year, while credit default swaps, an insurance-like derivative, had risen. But the latest move helped calm markets: shares in the bank rose 3% in early trading.

<strong>Britain’s</strong> climate minister said that the government was not asking people to use less energy, one day after the company that manages the country’s power-transmission network warned that homes and businesses could face power cuts over the winter. Meanwhile the <strong>EU</strong> and <strong>Norway</strong>—Europe’s largest external gas supplier after Russia cut its flows to the bloc—agreed to “jointly develop tools” to normalise the [energy market](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/08/europes-energy-market-was-not-built-for-this-crisis) and reduce [prices](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/05/europe-scrambles-to-protect-citizens-from-sky-high-energy-prices).

The <strong>UN’s human rights council</strong> rejected a debate on <strong>China’s</strong> treatment of [Uyghurs](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/07/12/what-is-happening-to-the-uyghurs-in-xinjiang) and other minority groups. The motion was proposed by Western countries including America, Britain and Canada. Pakistan, one of 19 countries to vote no, said it did not wish to alienate China. It is only the second time that a motion has been rejected by the council since it was established in 2006.

<strong>Mr Biden</strong> pardoned all Americans convicted of simple <strong>marijuana</strong> possession under federal law, fulfilling a campaign pledge. The move affects more than 6,500 people. He also ordered a review of whether marijuana should remain, for sentencing purposes, in the same class of drugs as heroin and LSD. [Recreational marijuana use](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/05/14/in-california-the-worlds-largest-legal-weed-market-is-going-up-in-smoke) is legal in 19 states and Washington, DC.

Quarterly profits at <strong>Samsung Electronics</strong> fell for the first time in three years, as demand for smartphones and memory chips plummeted. The South Korean conglomerate—the [market leader](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/10/21/samsung-electronics-wants-to-dominate-cutting-edge-chipmaking) in both fields—estimated that operating earnings in the third quarter dropped by 32%, to 10.8trn won ($7.7bn), compared with a year earlier. The woeful state of the [world’s economy](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2022/10/05/inflation-and-rising-demands-on-governments-are-changing-economic-policy) is mainly to blame.

## Europe’s property slowdown

House prices across Britain and the EU have spiralled since the start of the pandemic. But not for much longer, according to two separate indices published on Friday. Halifax, a British lender, said prices edged down by 0.1% in September from a record high in August. The typical price of a house in Britain is now £293,835 ($330,000). Meanwhile, Eurostat, the EU’s statistics agency, reported the first slowdown in two years. House prices in the EU rose by 9.3% between the second quarters of this year and last year, down from the annual rise of 9.8% in the previous quarter.

Higher mortgage rates and a cost-of-living squeeze are[ dampening buyer enthusiasm](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/01/the-global-housing-boom-is-running-out-of-steam). A meltdown akin to America’s subprime crisis when prices fell by a third looks unlikely: a chronic shortage of homes has seen prices across the EU soar by[](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/ddn-20220708-1)45% since 2010. Tight labour markets, which improve household finances, mean that homes are still being snapped up. But as the market cools, a reversal could be around the corner.

## Will Ohio’s abortion ban survive?

The overturning of [<em>Roe v Wade</em>](https://www.economist.com/united-states/how-the-end-of-roe-v-wade-will-affect-american-politics/21809130) in June has opened up a battleground in the Buckeye state. The removal of federal protections opened the way for Ohio’s “trigger ban”, introduced in 2019, to come into force. It prohibited almost all abortions after six weeks. But in mid-September a judge in Hamilton County temporarily suspended the law, on the grounds that Ohio’s constitution guarantees a “fundamental right to privacy, procreation, bodily integrity and freedom of choice”. His ruling, which lasts until October 12th, was a victory for pro-choice campaigners.

On Friday the court will hold another hearing on the injunction. And specific abortion cases are percolating through the courts. In June a ten-year-old was forced to travel to Indiana from Ohio for an abortion after being raped. Indiana’s Republican attorney-general threatened to prosecute the doctor who performed the abortion, claiming, incorrectly, that she had not filed the correct paperwork; she is now suing him for defamation. The battles over abortion show no sign of losing steam.

## Rumbles over independence in Catalonia

On Friday one of Catalonia’s two governing parties, Junts per Catalunya, will announce the result of an internal vote on whether to leave the government. Both Junts and its coalition partner, Esquerra Republicana (ERC), support Catalonian independence. Both backed the [illegal independence referendum](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/09/26/why-the-referendum-on-catalan-independence-is-illegal) of October 2017, which prompted the national government in Madrid to suspend the region’s self-rule. After a bare majority of voters chose pro-independence parties in last year’s [regional elections](https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/02/15/catalonias-separatists-score-another-victory-but-a-hollow-one), many separatist politicians took the result as a mandate to press on.

But the partners are divided on speed. The smaller, more conservative Junts are impatient, while the larger ERC has banked on winning concessions from Madrid through a formal dialogue that began last year. A crackup of the coalition risks putting the independence question on ice. ERC will need votes from more mainstream parties to govern; those groups will want to prioritise the economy. Despite their differences, neither party wants new elections.

## Little Lesotho makes a big decision

The general election in Lesotho on Friday will be one of the least-watched votes in the world this year. The neglect is understandable: Lesotho is a poor and tiny country of just 2.2m people, entirely encircled by South Africa. Yet a new government could jolt the former British protectorate to turn the page on a tumultuous recent history. 

Since independence in 1966 Lesotho has seen coups, attempted coups, prime ministers fleeing the country, assassinations of military bosses, unstable coalition governments and, most recently, a former prime minister [accused of conspiring](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2020/01/23/one-first-lady-is-dead-in-lesotho-another-has-fled) with his third wife to murder his second. (The charges were dropped in July.) [Corruption](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/01/25/corruption-is-getting-worse-in-many-poor-countries) and crime are rampant. Politics is about access to spoils, not the pursuit of the greater good.

The next government will probably be another coalition involving ideologically indistinguishable parties. As pressure from donors and civil society mounts, its priority should be to pass constitutional reforms. That is, if it is not too busy at the trough to bother.

## The Beatles and Bond, 60 years on

Sixty years ago this week the Beatles released their debut single, “Love Me Do”, and the first James Bond film, “Dr No”, premiered at the London Pavilion. Neither was an instant hit. Liverpool’s finest failed to make Britain’s top ten, whilst Sean Connery’s Bond was roasted by the critics, one calling him “a great big hairy marshmallow”. Things worked out in the end, of course; the 25 official Bond films have made more than $7bn at the box office, and the Beatles retain most of the world records for shifting pop music.

John Higgs explores the seismic, and intertwining, cultural impact of the Beatles and Bond in his new book, “[Love and Let Die](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/09/22/sixty-years-ago-james-bond-and-the-beatles-made-debuts)”. Both heralded a vivid, technicolour break with the buttoned-up wartime generation. Yet, as Mr Higgs writes, alongside the jetset modernity, the Bond films cleaved to attitudes on women and class that were already reactionary, and the Beatles won acclaim with the “faux Victoriana” of “Sgt. Pepper”. Little wonder they were so popular in Britain.
