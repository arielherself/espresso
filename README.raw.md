Turkish officials said that they had issued more than 110 arrest warrants for architects, contractors and engineers connected with buildings that collapsed in [devastating earthquakes](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/02/09/the-earthquakes-in-turkey-and-syria-have-shaken-both-countries) on February 6th. The government has been widely blamed for not enforcing construction standards. Meanwhile, unrest in the south of the country disrupted rescue efforts. The death toll in <strong>Turkey</strong> and neighbouring <strong>Syria</strong> has now passed 33,000.

Chuck Schumer, the majority leader of <strong>America’s</strong> Senate, said he believes the flying objects shot down in North American airspace on Friday and Saturday were <strong>balloons</strong>. He hinted that they were <strong>Chinese </strong>spy balloons, but did not explicitly say so. Tensions between America and China have been running high since a [Chinese surveillance blimp](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/02/07/the-lessons-from-the-chinese-spy-balloon) was shot down off South Carolina on February 4th.

Nikos Christodoulides was chosen as the next president of <strong>Cyprus</strong> in a runoff election on Sunday. The former foreign minister once served in the ruling right-wing government, but ran as an independent candidate. Mr Christodoulides now must try to make good on his campaign promises, which included restarting stalled talks about reunifying the ethnically divided island and overhauling the energy infrastructure.

Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, told the BBC that sending <strong>fighter jets</strong> to <strong>Ukraine </strong>would have to be a “joint decision” with other NATO members and would “not be easy to take”. Ukraine’s Western allies—including Poland, one of the most hawkish—remain leery of sending [American F-15 or F-16 ](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/02/01/why-does-ukraine-want-western-jets-and-will-it-get-them)aircraft, despite the entreaties made by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in London, Paris and Brussels this week.

<strong>Iran’s</strong> president, Ebrahim Raisi, declared that months-long <strong>protests </strong>against his regime had [been defeated](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/01/12/protests-have-subsided-in-iran-but-clerics-cannot-yet-proclaim-victory). The country was roiled by demonstrations following the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old who was beaten by police. Speaking at a rally to mark the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Mr Raisi claimed the protests had been fuelled by Western “conspiracies”.

Marc Tarabella, a Belgian MEP, was charged with <strong>corruption</strong> and other crimes over his alleged role in the [money-for-influence scheme](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/12/15/a-corruption-scandal-leaves-the-eu-reeling) at the <strong>European Parliament</strong> that is said to involve Qatar. Another MEP who is co-operating with prosecutors had alleged that Mr Tarabella received up to €140,000 ($150,000) in bribes. Five other people have been charged with the same offences so far.

Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of <strong>France</strong> for a fourth national protest against plans to raise the [pension age](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/01/31/why-is-the-french-pension-age-so-low) from 62 to 64. In January, more than 1m workers took part in strikes. Even though the French spend longer in retirement on average than people in almost any other country in the OECD, most oppose President Emmanuel Macron’s plans.

<strong>Word of the week: </strong><em>dekasegi ryugaku</em>, a Japanese term that means “earning money while studying overseas”. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/02/09/japanese-workers-are-seeking-higher-wages-overseas).

## Re-run of elections in Berlin

On Sunday, for the first time, the city of Berlin is re-running elections for its parliament and 12 district councils. The ballots, which originally took place in September 2021, were nullified by Berlin’s constitutional court owing to chaotic scenes at polling stations. Voters had to queue for hours, often only to find that the places had run out of voting paper or ballot boxes. The disruptions were in part caused by a marathon that was held on the same day.

The annulment allowed Franziska Giffey, Berlin’s mayor, from the Social Democratic Party (SPD), to hold on to her seat. But her party is now trailing the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in the latest polls. Yet even if the conservatives win the most votes, the party might not be able to form a government. The governing coalition of SPD, Greens and the Left Party is determined to stay in power and have one of their own take the mayor’s job.

## Betting at, and on, the Super Bowl

On Sunday, for the 57th time, two American-football teams—this year, the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs—will play for the championship in the Super Bowl. For the first time, the game will be held in a state (Arizona) where sports betting is legal.

The National Football League long treated [gambling](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/02/10/the-national-football-league-bets-on-betting) as a threat. Twenty years ago, it barred ads encouraging people to visit Las Vegas from appearing during its games. In 2018, though, the Supreme Court overturned a federal law forbidding states other than Nevada from legalising sports betting. Today, some form of wagering on sports is legal in most states.

On Sunday, fans in Arizona can bet from their seats using their phones, or in person at a sportsbook just a few hundred feet from the stadium. They’ll have company: roughly 20% of American adults are expected to bet a total of around $16bn on Sunday’s game, and more than one-third of fans say that being able to do so has made games more exciting.

## A bowling success for women’s cricket

The Women’s T20 World Cup—a cricket tournament that began with the hosts, South Africa, taking on Sri Lanka on Friday—offers another example of the sport’s rapid progress. Skills are sharpening and the talent pool is deepening. That is largely thanks to high-profile domestic tournaments, such as the Women’s Big Bash League in Australia and The Hundred in Britain, which create more opportunities for sponsorship and investment.  
  
 The launch of the [Women’s Premier League in India](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/02/09/indian-investors-pile-in-to-womens-cricket) in March will overshadow the lot. Investors spent $570m to acquire the five competing teams in January, an incredible sum for any women’s sport. The player auction on Monday, to allocate players and determine their wages, will be fierce. Some players will receive the biggest pay packets of their careers, earning as much in the three-week WPL as in a year with their national teams. Their excitement may not be shared by those teammates who go unsold.

## Norwegian women marry up

Norway is known for its fjords, fish and feminism. For decades it has jockeyed with its Nordic neighbours at the top of gender-equality charts. But in affairs of the heart, old habits die hard. Research in <em>The Journal of Human Resources</em> shows that hypergamy—marrying “up” a social class—influences how Norwegian women choose a romantic partner. 

By using parental income as a proxy for earning potential, the study controlled for the lingering pay gap, and found that women tend to marry men of higher status. That creates more couples where the husband earns more, incentivising a more traditional division of labour. 

These trends do not appear to have faded with increasing egalitarianism around the world. Hypergamy documented in [China](https://www.economist.com/1843/2018/03/05/a-wife-less-ordinary) has been blamed on a misogynistic culture. But its presence in the Nordic gender utopia serves as a reminder of the firm grip of primal forces.

## Weekend profile: Gustavo Dudamel, star maestro

Gustavo Dudamel is easily excited—unusually so in the [serious world](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/17/the-classical-music-world-is-grappling-with-accessibility) of classical music. “Everything was too loud and everything was too fast, and I loved it,” remembered Sir Simon Rattle, an illustrious conductor, of his introduction to Mr Dudamel, then a [young prodigy](https://www.economist.com/1843/2013/12/23/gustavo-dudamels-next-mountain). Now aged 42, Mr Dudamel has mastered the tempo without sacrificing the passion. On Tuesday it was announced that he will jump from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which he has led since 2009, to the New York Philharmonic in 2026. 

Born in Venezuela, Mr Dudamel got his start in the country’s famous free music education programme, El Sistema, playing the violin. When his own conductor was late to rehearsal one day, he picked up the baton and gave it a whirl. His conductor invited him to be his assistant; Mr Dudamel was about 12. He soon began directing a Venezuelan orchestra and won an international conducting competition in Germany at the age of 23. 

Today the curly-haired Mr Dudamel is one of the world’s most recognisable maestros. He has brought verve to the Los Angeles Philharmonic; the Paris Opera, where he is music director; and the animated film “Trolls 2: World Tour” (for which he voiced the character of a conductor). He has led Venezuela’s Simón Bolívar Youth Orchestra in a rousing version of “Mambo”, from Leonard Bernstein’s “West Side Story”, a number of times. One performance has 1.7m views on YouTube. 

Mr Dudamel’s appointment in New York should restore some cachet to the ensemble, which, in its glory days in the mid-20th century, was led by Bernstein. Today it faces a challenging financial future: elderly concertgoers have been reluctant to return even as the pandemic subsides. Mr Dudamel’s spirited conducting and renown promise to attract crowds and wealthy donors.

In Los Angeles, he always made a point of bowing to the cheap seats behind the orchestra. He encourages clapping between sets and rejects stilted dress codes. It is the music, not its trappings, that so excites him.
