<strong>America </strong>announced that travellers from <strong>China </strong>will have to produce a negative covid-19 test on arrival. Countries in Asia and Europe have already announced similar measures, as Chinese citizens prepare to resume outbound travel. Earlier this week China’s government announced it would end[ mandatory quarantine](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/12/07/china-is-loosening-its-covid-restrictions-at-great-risk) for inbound travellers in January. <strong>Hong Kong </strong>meanwhile scrapped most requirements on entry from the mainland and elsewhere.

<strong>Ukrainian </strong>officials said scores of Russian missiles had been launched at the country’s cities but that air defences had intercepted 54 out of 69 of them before they landed. The capital Kyiv was targeted, as well as Kharkiv, Lviv, Odessa and Zhytomyr. On the southern front Ukrainian officials urged residents of [Kherson](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/11/15/the-battle-for-kherson-in-maps), which they liberated just six weeks ago, to evacuate their city as Russian forces escalated mortar and artillery attacks. 

<strong>Pelé</strong>, the [Brazilian superstar footballer](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/12/29/pele-king-of-the-beautiful-game), died aged 82 at a hospital in São Paulo after a long battle with cancer. He was perhaps the best footballer to have ever played. Pelé (whose full name was Edson Arantes do Nascimento) won three World Cups for Brazil and six national titles with Santos, his club team. His 1,279 goals in 1,363 matches is a world record that is unlikely to be surpassed.

<strong>Binyamin Netanyahu </strong>was sworn in as<strong> Israel’s</strong> prime minister after the Knesset passed a vote of confidence in his new government. He leads a right-wing [coalition](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/10/the-changing-nature-of-israeli-politics) of his own Likud party together with smaller ultra-nationalist and ultra-Orthodox parties. Many fear that their policies could inflame relations with the Palestinians, particularly over settlements. It is Mr Netanyahu’s sixth term as prime minister, a record.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>America’s</strong> Department of Labour announced a slight rise in the number of first-time <strong>benefits claimants</strong>, up by 9,000 to 225,000 in the week ending on December 24th. The figures suggest a modest softening in a tight labour market, raising hopes that a slowing economy might persuade the Fed not to raise interest rates again by as much as had been feared.

With two days to spare, the <strong>Italian</strong> Senate approved a budget for next year—the first from [Giorgia Meloni’s](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/italians-will-soon-discover-who-the-real-giorgia-meloni-is) right-wing government. To ensure it passed, her cabinet made the crucial vote one of confidence in the government. The budget provides more than €21bn ($22bn) for offsetting the effects of the energy crisis. More controversially, it curbs Italy’s main poverty relief scheme, paving the way for its abolition.

Police in <strong>Bolivia</strong> arrested Luis Fernando Camacho, a prominent opposition leader, on charges of “terrorism”. The right-wing governor of the wealthy state of Santa Cruz has been leading demonstrations against the leftist government of President [Luis Arce](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2020/10/24/dont-mess-up-bolivias-miracle). Mr Camacho’s supporters claim that he has been “kidnapped”; his arrest sparked violent protests in Santa Cruz.

## 2023 in preview: Inflation will come under control

<em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will shape finance?</em>

[High inflation](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2022/10/05/the-inflation-problem-will-get-better-before-it-gets-worse) has stalked many of the world’s economies over the last couple of years. The surge was driven by looser fiscal policy to combat the pandemic shutdowns followed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which sent prices of food and energy skyward. In the euro area the rate of consumer-price growth reached a record 10.7% in 2022; in America it peaked at 9%.

Central banks were criticised by some for not raising interest rates early enough to snuff out inflation. Regardless, 2022 was the year in which those increases came regularly, and steeply. Consequently, most countries will get inflation back under control in 2023, but not without serious pain. America’s Federal Reserve predicts an uptick in unemployment in 2023; the [Bank of England ](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/10/27/the-bank-of-england-has-seen-off-several-threats)forecasts a drop in Britain’s GDP. In fact, the last time that the world saw such a confluence of growth-restricting policies, in 1982, it induced a global recession. There is good reason to worry that 2023 will not be any different. 

## 2023 in preview: Expect little relief on energy prices

<em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will shape finance?</em>

Despite [Western sanctions](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/24/western-sanctions-will-eventually-impair-russias-economy) and Russian supply cuts, Europe should have enough gas to last this winter. And by next winter it should have more terminals to receive[ liquefied natural gas](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/11/10/can-american-liquefied-natural-gas-rescue-europe), making it less dependent on Russia’s piped fuel. Nonetheless, the energy market will probably flare up again in 2023, for two main reasons.

For a start, disruptions to supply look set to continue. From February Russia will ban the sale of its oil and petroleum products to Western countries that have imposed a price cap on them. As the continent sources more of its vast imports from Asia rather than Russia, new bottlenecks are bound to appear. OPEC could also announce yet more big cuts in production in order to keep prices up. Second, refined products, such as petrol and diesel, are becoming scarcer. In February, Europe is set to ban imports of such fuels from Russia. Europe in particular is struggling to produce enough of its own diesel. A global diesel crunch could strike as early as March.

## 2023 in preview: Will the bull market return?

<em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will shape finance?</em>

Bear markets come in all shapes and sizes. Since the 1950s, there have been 11 of them. The shortest, in 2020, lasted a single month; the longest, from 2000, more than two-and-a-half years. History, then, is not a foolproof guide as to whether stockmarkets will continue into 2023 the slide they began in 2022—but it does offer clues.

The longest slumps occur when the fall in asset prices reveals financial misdeeds committed when the going was good—think [subprime mortgages](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2017/05/04/how-the-2007-08-crisis-unfolded) in the mid-2000s. The current bear market has unpicked major crypto businesses and exposed weaknesses in British pension funds, which were imperilled in September 2022 by margin calls on some bond derivatives they held. Volatility in American Treasury markets has spiked, too. However, after 15 years of regulatory reform in the financial system it is hard to imagine anything happening on the scale of 2007-09. That’s the good news. But continued [tightening in monetary policy ](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/13/rates-are-rising-at-unprecedented-speed-when-will-they-bite)and slowing economic activity may still delay the return of the bulls.

## 2023 in preview: Low productivity in the boring twenties

<em>This week we are looking ahead to next year’s big stories. Today, what will shape finance?</em>

At the depths of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020-21, many spoke of a silver lining. The rapid development and deployment of vaccines seemed to show that when the world gets its act together it can, indeed, do amazing things. In response pundits predicted a “roaring twenties”, with all sorts of new inventions coming to market. A vaccine for cancer! Driverless cars! Virtual-reality goggles for all! Companies seemed to believe the hype, promising huge increases in investment.

So far, however, the world is proving to be even less innovative than it was before. Global [productivity growth](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/12/14/why-are-the-rich-worlds-politicians-giving-up-on-economic-growth) is extremely weak, and possibly negative—meaning that the average worker is actually producing less than before. There is little sign that 2023 will be different. The optimistic case is that there is a lag between firms’ investment spending and higher productivity, and that eventually productivity will soar. The realistic case is that world-changing innovations, and thus economic growth, are harder to come by. The twenties are likely to be more boring than roaring.
