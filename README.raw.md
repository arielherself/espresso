Sporadic <strong>anti-lockdown protests </strong>broke out in <strong>Beijing</strong>, China’s capital, as similar demonstrations took place in Xinjiang, a province in western China. A fire in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, killed ten people. Many demonstrators blamed [covid-19 restrictions](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/11/24/chinas-response-to-a-surge-in-covid-19-cases-is-muddled) for slowing the response of emergency services. Chinese authorities said on Saturday that covid-19 restrictions would be eased in “stages” in Urumqi following the outbursts, while some areas of Beijing have lifted restrictions ahead of schedule.

<strong>Ukraine’s </strong>foreign ministry said that Russia was using “genocidal” Soviet tactics [against the country.](https://www.economist.com/interactive/graphic-detail/2022/11/26/high-fuel-prices-could-kill-more-europeans-than-fighting-in-ukraine-has) Ukraine commemorated the victims of the “Holodomor”, a Stalin-era famine that killed millions, and which many historians see as a deliberate campaign of starvation. Earlier, in a carefully stage-managed event, President Vladimir Putin told a group of Russian mothers, some of whose sons have died fighting, that he shares their pain.

<strong>Israel’s</strong> incoming prime minister, [Binyamin Netanyahu](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/04/bibi-is-back-and-israel-faces-a-dilemma-over-democracy), moved towards forming a government as his Likud party signed its first coalition deal with the far-right <strong>Jewish Power</strong> party. Under the initial pact, which does not finalise the full coalition, JP’s leader, [Itamar Ben-Gvir](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/11/03/who-is-itamar-ben-gvir-israels-kingmaker), will become police minister and join the country’s security cabinet. The new government looks set to be the most right-wing in Israel’s history.

<strong>Iranian</strong> security officials fired at protesters in the south-eastern province of Sistan-Baluchistan after Friday prayers, leaving dozens of casualties, according to activists tracking the demonstrations. Meanwhile the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps deployed more soldiers to Kurdish regions in the north of the country. Iran’s [protests](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/24/while-irans-turmoil-persists-jitters-spread-through-the-region) were sparked by the killing of a 22-year-old Kurdish woman in police custody on September 16th.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

This year’s <strong>Black Friday</strong>—America’s annual shopping bonanza—appeared to be a relatively subdued affair. The day after Thanksgiving is the busiest day of the year for the country’s shops, but economic worries are prompting parsimony among consumers. Some forecasters predict that sales will be up just 1% on last year, when retailers were still reeling from the pandemic.

The <strong>Federal Communication Commission</strong>, America’s telecommunications regulator, banned <strong>Huawei </strong>and <strong>ZTE</strong>, two Chinese technology firms, from selling goods in America. The commission cited national security concerns. The FCC had previously restricted companies from using government money to buy Huawei&#x27;s gear, but this ruling covers all private-sector purchases. The Biden administration had earlier stopped the export of semiconductors to China, in an increasingly protectionist turn.

<strong>Football World Cup:</strong> <strong>Poland</strong> secured their first win of the tournament, beating <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> despite spirited opposition. Robert Lewandowski scored one of the goals, taking his total for Poland to 77. On Friday, pro- and anti government <strong>Iran</strong> fans clashed in the stands, during the country’s match against <strong>Wales</strong>. Iran went on to win with two late goals. Elsewhere <strong>America’s</strong> footballers maintained their unbeaten record against <strong>England</strong> at World Cups, as the teams played out a turgid goalless draw, the fifth in the competition’s first 20 matches.

## Russian fertiliser sets sail for Africa

Many poor countries rely on Russian [fertiliser](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/05/31/why-fertiliser-prices-are-soaring) to boost their harvests. But more than 400,000 tonnes of the stuff are currently stuck in European warehouses. Although fertilisers are exempt from sanctions, banks and insurance companies are wary of backing trade in Russian goods, lest they accidently get slapped with fines or criminal charges. 

That is a pain for Russia, which was enticed to back a deal to allow grain to leave Ukraine’s Black Sea ports with promises of help for its fertiliser trade. Russian companies have offered to donate stocks to African countries but have struggled to pay for the freight. So the UN has stepped in. This weekend a ship chartered by its World Food Programme is en route from the Netherlands to Malawi, bearing 20,000 tonnes of Russian fertiliser. It is in everyone’s interests to shovel fertiliser along again.

## A call of duty for American regulators

America’s Federal Trade Commission is preparing to decide whether to oppose Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, a video-game developer that the software firm agreed to [buy for $69bn](https://www.economist.com/business/why-microsoft-is-splashing-69bn-on-video-games/21807242) in January. [Microsoft](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/04/15/the-method-in-microsofts-merger-madness), which makes the Xbox console, would get Activision’s library of games, including “Candy Crush”, a mobile hit, and the murderously popular “Call of Duty” franchise. [Sony](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/02/04/how-sony-can-make-a-comeback-in-the-console-wars), in particular, worries that Microsoft might take Activision titles away from its rival PlayStation console.

Microsoft has promised to keep “Call of Duty” on the PlayStation for a decade. It has pointed out to the FTC, and 15 other competition watchdogs examining the deal, that its Xbox lags behind both Nintendo and Sony in the console market, and that it has little presence in mobile. But trustbusters, who in recent years have placed big tech in their sights, worry about Microsoft’s leading position in subscription and [cloud-based gaming](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/06/15/video-gaming-enters-the-cloud). Those are tiny industries for now, but regulators are in a trigger-happy mood.

## The art and activism of Nan Goldin

“All the Beauty and the Bloodshed” profiles a master of candid photography who went on to confront the billionaires at the heart of the opioid crisis. In the 1980s Nan Goldin made her name with disarmingly intimate images of bohemian young outsiders like herself. A few years ago she revealed her own near-fatal brush with OxyContin addiction, and launched a protest against the [Sackler family](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/05/13/patrick-radden-keefe-traces-the-roots-of-americas-opioid-epidemic), who founded and owned Purdue Pharma, which made the drug.

The documentary, which premiered in America on Wednesday, maintains a hushed intensity as Ms Goldin recounts her traumatic upbringing: a beloved sister’s suicide, suburban parents in denial, foster homes. It is directed by Laura Poitras, who shows how Ms Goldin responded by pressing museums into removing the Sacklers’ name from their nameplates. The film is a portrait of the artist as lover and fighter, tough and tender, and hiding nothing.

## The pleasures of “Peanuts”

Who is the greatest dog in fiction? Lassie, Rin Tin Tin and Dorothy’s Toto in “The Wizard of Oz”? All have their appeal. But the answer is surely Snoopy. His creator, Charles Schulz, born 100 years ago on Saturday, translated his dour Minnesotan childhood into [“Peanuts”](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/17/peanuts-charles-schulzs-cartoon-probed-the-human-condition), a cartoon strip in which children confront uncomfortable truths virtually free from adult intervention. Schulz reimagined his boyhood pet, Spike, a playful mongrel, as a beagle: the loyal companion of the hapless Charlie Brown.

Schulz’s human characters, with their large heads and tiny torsos, look vulnerable. They muse bleakly about unrequited love and the elusive nature of happiness. But Snoopy is a sunny presence, the only “Peanuts” character allowed to give kisses. Besides inspiring many people to own a dog, Schulz’s Snoopy encouraged other artists to imbue their own animal creations with psychological depth. And Schulz was paid more than peanuts—by the time he died in 2000, Snoopy merchandise was netting him $30m-40m a year.

## Weekend profile: Hervé Renard, manager of the Saudi football team

At the World Cup in Qatar, Saudi [fans](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/17/qatars-neighbours-hope-for-a-world-cup-tourism-boom) are outnumbered only by Americans and those of the hosts. Proximity to Qatar certainly helps, but no one should doubt the Saudis’ passion for the game. Yet their national team had little to show for it on the sport’s biggest stage—until this week. On Tuesday the Green Falcons, as they are known, [shocked](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/23/what-saudi-arabias-football-victory-means-for-the-middle-east) Argentina, among the pre-tournament favourites.

King Salman gave workers the day off in celebration, just one sign of the commitment the country’s rulers have shown to the sport. In 2021 the Saudi Public Investment Fund, chaired by Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, bought Newcastle United, a team in England’s [Premier League](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/08/04/an-unusual-season-for-english-footballs-premier-league). PIF money has also poured into Saudi Arabia’s domestic league, which attracts tens of thousands of spectators. And Saudi officials are plotting an audacious bid to host the World Cup in 2030.

For all that, the Saudis’ most astute decision may prove to be the appointment, in 2019, of Hervé Renard as manager of the national team. Against Argentina, commentators found his tactic of holding a high defensive line naive, but it proved overpowering on the pitch. Mr Renard’s inspirational pep talk at half-time, when Saudi Arabia were trailing, was also instrumental, according to one player.

The victory felt like the culmination of Mr Renard’s own journey. In 1999 he began coaching SC Draguignan, a small team in the south of France, after his unremarkable playing career had been cut short by injury. To make ends meet, he worked as a cleaner between training sessions, something he later described as the “best schooling” he ever had. Other coaching stints, in Asia and [Africa](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/24/how-do-budding-african-footballers-make-it-to-the-top), followed. In 2012 he led unfancied Zambia to their first African Cup of Nations win. Three years later he took the trophy again, this time with Ivory Coast. 

Mr Renard’s decision to take the Saudi job earned him plenty of criticism, given the country’s poor human-rights record. He insists such matters have “improved a lot,” and that he accepted the role for sporting reasons, not the significant money on offer. On Saturday his team lost to Poland. But the Saudis may yet secure a first appearance in the World Cup’s knockout stages since 1994 with a win against Mexico on November 30th. Should they pull it off, that would strengthen Mr Renard’s claim that Saudi Arabia truly is a “country of football”.
