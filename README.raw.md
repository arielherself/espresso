The warrant used by the <strong>FBI </strong>to search <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s home was issued because the Justice Department said it believed that Mr Trump violated the Espionage Act, which prohibits the possession or transmission of national security information. Mr Trump did not object to a request by Merrick Garland, the attorney-general, that a Florida court unseal the warrant. The agents who [searched Mar-a-Lago](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/09/an-fbi-raid-on-donald-trumps-home-ignites-a-political-firestorm) reportedly removed 11 sets of classified documents, including material marked “top secret” and information on French president Emmanuel Macron. 

Five <strong>Chinese state-owned firms</strong> will apply to <strong>delist </strong>from the New York Stock Exchange, including China Life Insurance and energy giants PetroChina and Sinopec. All five failed to meet American auditing standards earlier this year. The price of other Chinese stocks listed in America tumbled in response to the news. Sino-American tensions are [running high](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/08/11/how-the-crisis-over-taiwan-will-change-us-china-relations) following the visit of Nancy Pelosi, an American politician, [to Taiwan](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/11/how-to-prevent-a-war-between-america-and-china-over-taiwan).

<strong>Salman Rushdie</strong>, the author of “The Satanic Verses”, was <strong>stabbed </strong>several times when he was about to deliver a lecture in Chautauqua, New York. Mr Rushdie was airlifted to the hospital; New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, said he was alive and getting the care he needs. His attacker has been taken into police custody. “The Satanic Verses” inspired controversy upon its release in 1988. Some Muslims said it was blasphemous, and Iran called for Mr Rushdie’s death.

<strong>Britain </strong>declared a <strong>drought </strong>in parts of the country for the first time since 2018. The announcement came amid a [heatwave](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/20/todays-heatwaves-are-a-warning-of-worse-to-come) and on the heels of Britain’s driest July in almost 90 years. Several water companies have imposed restrictions on water usage, prohibiting customers from using hoses on their cars or gardens.

<strong>Taiwan </strong>will no longer host WorldPrideTaiwan 2025, following a request from the event’s licensing body to drop the word “Taiwan” from the event title. At the behest of China, international organisations often insist that the self-governing island uses names other than “Taiwan”. But the WorldPride organisers said that capitulating to the request on this occasion would “harm the interests of Taiwan”. 

A trip by China’s president, <strong>Xi Jinping,</strong> reportedly being planned for November, may include a first face-to-face meeting with his American counterpart <strong>Joe Biden</strong> since Mr Biden became president. They may get together on the margins of multilateral summits in Indonesia or Thailand. Reports also suggest that Mr Xi, who has not left China for nearly three years, may visit Saudi Arabia this month. The Chinese foreign ministry refused to comment. 

<strong>Britain’s</strong> GDP contracted by 0.1% in the three months to June, compared with the previous quarter. The Office for National Statistics attributed most of the decline in services output to a fall in health and social work activities related to covid-19. Household consumption fell by 0.2%. The new GDP numbers signal another blow to [Britain’s faltering economy](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/08/11/britains-economy-is-taking-a-drubbing).

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 29%, the increase in violent crimes involving guns in American states where right-to-carry laws were adopted. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/08/11/a-supreme-court-ruling-could-spell-even-more-gun-crime).

## The IRA’s journey to the president’s desk

On Friday America’s House of Representatives passed the Inflation Reduction Act, a large piece of legislation that will increase some taxes, reduce health-care costs and, most importantly, unlock a vast array of investments to fight climate change. Altogether, the IRA is forecast to generate over $700bn of tax revenue and health savings for the government, much of which will be funnelled towards clean energy.

An earlier iteration of the law, the $3.5trn [Build Back Better](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/12/19/joe-manchin-kills-the-build-back-better-act-joe-bidens-ambitious-legislative-package) bill, was stymied by Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat senator from West Virginia. But a last-minute surprise deal between Mr Manchin and his party’s bigwigs revived a slimline version of the package. To get through a[ Senate](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/09/joe-bidens-signature-legislation-passes-the-senate-at-last) divided on party lines, yet more provisions had to be scaled down.

The final bill was renamed to assuage Americans’ fears about inflation, although it will do next to nothing to reduce it.[ It is imperfect—and essential](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/08/americas-climate-plus-spending-bill-is-flawed-but-essential). For years America has sounded the alarm over climate change while doing little to put out fires. Build Back Better was more ambitious. But the IRA is much better than nothing.

## Russia’s economy battles sanctions

The sanctions the West has imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine have hurt, but not severely enough to prompt a rethink in the Kremlin. New Russian GDP figures, released on Friday, will indicate the scale of the damage.  
  
 The official data are unlikely to deviate much from an estimate by the VEB Institute, a Russian state-owned development bank, that the economy continued to shrink in June. It expects a 5.7% fall of GDP in the second quarter of 2022, compared with the first quarter, when the Russian economy had already stagnated.  
  
 The hit is not as bad as the covid shock, but is almost certain to last longer. It is comparable in size to the financial crisis of 2008-09. But some sectors may have bottomed out. Industrial output grew slightly in June, and resource extraction rebounded strongly; thus far Western sanctions on Russian fuel exports have been limited. The West may have to add more punitive measures to keep Vladimir Putin’s economy down.

## Easing quarantine for travellers to Hong Kong

Hong Kong has been isolated from the outside world for so long that residents joke they have Stockholm syndrome: token concessions from their captors bring outpourings of gratitude. So it was on Monday, when the government announced that from Friday anyone entering the territory must spend only three days in quarantine, down from a week previously—and [three weeks](https://www.economist.com/china/2020/05/02/a-view-from-the-covid-19th-floor) before that. That is a relief to those sealed inside tiny hotel rooms (including this correspondent), but will do little to persuade tourists and business travellers to return. With the wider world open, why endure even three days’ captivity? 

Maintaining punitive entry requirements is increasingly baffling since Hong Kong went through a [covid-19 wave](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/03/18/hong-kong-is-now-the-centre-of-the-pandemic) this year that infected perhaps half its 7.3m inhabitants. It tolerates around 4,000 new cases a day, with few restrictions on locals’ movement—hardly the zero-covid it once aspired to, or that mainland China still does. The consequences of isolation? On Friday Hong Kong confirmed consecutive quarters of shrinking year-on-year GDP.

## Britain’s economy wilts in the heat

The only news competing with [record temperatures](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/08/09/julys-heatwave-may-have-killed-thousands-of-britons) in Britain at the moment is the country’s dysfunctional economy. [Strikes](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/08/09/almost-nothing-seems-to-be-working-in-britain-it-could-get-worse) are back in fashion, but the most salient problem is the spiralling cost of living. Last week the [Bank of England](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/07/28/the-bank-of-england-must-weather-high-inflation-and-meddling-politicians) predicted that annual inflation would rise to just over 13% in October. At least half of this is driven by pricier electricity, gas and petrol. The annual bill paid by an average household is expected to more than double from around £2,000 ($2,400) now to £4,400 next April. On Friday the release of GDP figures for the second quarter confirmed the gloomy mood: the economy contracted by 0.1% compared with the previous quarter.

Some comfort may be found in the growing expectation that Britain’s looming recession will be shallower than those in either the global financial crisis or the pandemic. And yet none of this bodes well for Britain’s ability to break out of its [longer-term economic rut](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/06/09/low-economic-growth-is-a-slow-burning-crisis-for-britain).

## Three strikes for a new baseball film

“There’s no crying in baseball!” This line, from “A League of Their Own”, a classic film about America’s short-lived [women’s professional baseball league](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/08/11/a-league-of-their-own-examines-race-and-gender-in-baseballs-past), makes a reappearance in a television series of the same name. Like the movie, the show, released on Friday on Prime Video, tells the story of the (real-life) Rockford Peaches on their (fictional) journey to the 1943 World Series. Much else will be familiar to fans of the film. Players wear the same uniform, sing the same song—and overcome the same despicable sexism. 

Yet there are differences. The show ditches the film’s all-white cast. Most of its main characters are queer; several are black and Hispanic. It is also much raunchier. But diversity and debauchery do not make a satisfying show. “A League of Their Own” is caught uncomfortably between honouring the film and breaking its mould. The series taps into a surge of [interest](https://www.economist.com/international/2022/07/21/the-womens-euros-are-selling-out-stadiums) in women’s sport, but fewer feel-good quotes and more plot development would have helped it match its predecessor.
