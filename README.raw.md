The <strong>Bank of England</strong> confirmed that its emergency bond-buying scheme, aimed at helping troubled pension funds following the [British government’s](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/11/liz-truss-has-made-britain-a-riskier-bet-for-bond-investors) chaotic [mini-budget](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically), would end on Friday, as planned. The bank’s assurance came after a report in the <em>Financial Times</em> had indicated a possible extension, contradicting comments made by Andrew Bailey, the bank’s governor. The pound once again tumbled against the dollar, and yields on British 30-year bonds surged.

<strong>President Joe Biden</strong> said that he doubted <strong>Russia</strong> would use a tactical nuclear weapon in <strong>Ukraine</strong>, and NATO once again confirmed that it had seen no changes to the Kremlin’s nuclear posture. NATO defence ministers will meet in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss providing more military aid to Ukraine after a [brutal Russian bombardment](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/10/russia-launches-a-wave-of-missiles-across-ukraine) on Monday. On Tuesday the G7, a group of rich democracies, pledged their “financial, humanitarian, military, diplomatic and legal support” to Ukraine “for as long as it takes”.

Mr Biden will “re-evaluate” <strong>America’s</strong> relationship with <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> after the kingdom’s decision to reduce oil production, a White House official said. Last week the Saudi-led OPEC+ bloc of petroleum producers announced it would [cut output by 2m barrels per day](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/05/opec-defies-joe-biden-with-a-big-output-cut), despite sky-high prices. Mr Biden is reportedly considering retaliatory measures such as curbing arms sales and stripping OPEC members of immunity to American antitrust laws.

The Polish operator of the <strong>Druzhba</strong> pipeline, which carries oil from Russia to Europe, said that a leak it detected was likely to have been caused by an accident rather than sabotage. Nevertheless the discovery will add to growing concerns about Europe’s [energy security](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/08/how-to-deal-with-europes-energy-crisis), coming after explosions caused leaks in two other pipelines, Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

Brookfield Renewable Partners, a clean-energy investor, and Cameco, a uranium fuel supplier, said they would acquire <strong>Westinghouse Electric</strong>, an American <strong>nuclear-power</strong> firm, in a $7.9bn deal. The [energy crisis in Europe](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/08/how-to-deal-with-europes-energy-crisis) and soaring oil prices have sparked renewed interest in nuclear power. Tim Gitzel, Cameco’s boss, said the sector is “witnessing some of the best market fundamentals we’ve ever seen.”

<strong>America’s</strong> Supreme Court declined to assess whether fetuses count as legal “persons” by turning away an appeal to a ruling made in Rhode Island in May. In that case, two pregnant women tried to bring claims on behalf of their unborn children against the law that codified abortion rights in the state. Such [fetal “personhood” cases](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/07/a-push-to-recognise-the-rights-of-the-unborn-is-growing-in-america) are expected to increase. 

A male <strong>brown bear, </strong>known as 747, won [Fat Bear Week](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/10/04/alaskas-fat-bear-week-proves-conservation-can-be-joyful), a competition run by Katmai National Park in Alaska to identify which animal put on the most weight to prepare for hibernation. 747, who weighs an estimated 635kg, received 68,105 online votes, more than his rival in the final, a female called 901, who pulled in 56,876.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>49.7%, the estimated share of German companies that cannot secure enough skilled workers, up from 30% in 2019. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/06/there-are-not-enough-germans-to-do-the-jobs-germany-needs).

## Asia’s leaders gather in Kazakhstan

Vladimir Putin, the Russian president [waging war](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/10/russia-launches-a-wave-of-missiles-across-ukraine) on Ukraine, is among the heads of state who will gather in Astana, Kazakhstan’s capital, on Wednesday. The leaders are meeting for the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), an international forum that ostensibly promotes peace and security in its region.  
  
 CICA’s 27 member states, which include China and India, cover much of the [Middle East and Asia](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/05/05/china-unveils-its-vision-of-a-global-security-order). Kazakhstan’s president, Kassym-Zhomart Tokayev, hopes to use this meeting to bolster CICA’s international relevance. As well as Mr Putin the presidents of ten other countries, including Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Ebrahim Raisi of Iran, will attend.  
  
 The heads of some attending countries, including Mr Tokayev, are allies of Mr Putin, but sceptical of his war in Ukraine. Discussions of the conflict are thus likely to be shunted to the sidelines. Mr Putin may meet Mr Erdogan, who hopes to broker talks between Russia and the West. But the sight of one member state firing missiles at its smaller neighbour—Ukraine is one of CICA’s “observer” members—hardly inspires confidence in CICA’s peacebuilding mission.

## America’s contentious national monuments

On Wednesday President Joe Biden declared federal protection for the first “national monument” of his presidency, at Camp Hale high in Colorado’s Rocky Mountains. During the second world war, the army’s 10th Mountain Division learned to ski and rock climb there before being deployed to the European Alps. It will be the 159th area designated as such by a president.

The move is probably intended to boost Michael Bennet, a Democratic senator who has fought to preserve the site, before the midterm elections. It will also anger western Republicans, who view national monuments, on which activities such as drilling, mining, logging and grazing are restricted, as federal overreach. In August Republicans in Utah sued the Biden administration for rolling back Donald Trump’s decision to reduce in size two monuments there. If that case makes it to the Supreme Court, justices may consider the scope of the [Antiquities Act](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/10/08/what-is-the-antiquities-act), which allows presidents to designate vast monuments. Until then their number looks set to rise.

## Hong Kong’s “dim sum” bonds

Thanks to China’s strict [quarantine rules](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/08/18/chinas-economy-is-beset-by-problems), few mainland tourists cross into semi-autonomous Hong Kong to sample the city’s delights, including its tasty dim sum restaurants serving small dishes and tea. But mainlanders are snapping up a different kind of Hong Kong fare: bonds denominated in the mainland’s currency but issued in the city’s international market, which stands outside China’s capital controls. 

These securities, nicknamed “dim sum” bonds, are popular with mainland buyers because they offer slightly higher yields than equivalent onshore assets. And they are attractive to sellers because, thanks to rising interest rates in America, it is now cheaper to borrow in the yuan than in the dollar. China’s government itself sold another 5.5bn-yuan ($770m) worth of bonds on Wednesday. As an international financial centre, Hong Kong benefits from this turnover. These sales thus serve two purposes. They help the mainland by raising money for it. And they help Hong Kong by raising money in it.

## Sinn Féin’s vision for Ireland

On Wednesday evening Sinn Féin, a political party which wants the reunification of Ireland, will hold its inaugural People’s Assembly, in Belfast. The event is the first in its “Commission on the Future of Ireland” campaign to gather opinions from across the island.

Polls in Northern Ireland mostly show support for Irish unity far behind that for keeping Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom. In May, Sinn Féin became Northern Ireland’s [largest political party](https://www.economist.com/britain/sinn-fein-has-become-northern-irelands-biggest-party/21809215)—but still took just 29% of the vote. In the Republic of Ireland the party could do well enough in the next general election, in 2025, to lead the next governing coalition.  
  
 Despite this, and the party’s pledge that the commission will engage with Protestants, loyalists and unionists, Wednesday’s event is likely to see a few hundred republicans mostly talking to each other. Persuading voters to switch parties is hard. Getting them to switch countries is even harder. And for many people, on both sides of the border, Sinn Féin’s violent history makes the party off-putting.

## Warhol’s copyright battle

A First Amendment creativity quarrel arrives at America’s Supreme Court on Wednesday. The case pits a photographer, Lynn Goldsmith, against the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts (AWF), which controls the late artist’s estate. 

In 1981, Ms Goldsmith took a photograph of Prince, a musician. Three years later, <em>Vanity Fair</em>, a magazine, licensed the black-and-white image from Ms Goldsmith and commissioned [Andy Warhol](https://www.economist.com/1843/2020/01/15/how-andy-warhol-invented-american-art) to use it as the basis of “Purple Prince”, a colourful screenprint. Warhol eventually made 16 “Prince” images in various colours. When Prince died in 2016, the AWF foundation licensed “Orange Prince” to <em>Condé Nast</em>, which owns <em>Vanity Fair</em>, without informing (or paying) Ms Goldsmith. 

Allowing such appropriation, Ms Goldsmith says, amounts to “all copying, no right” and would “decimate creators’ livelihoods”. The foundation counters that Warhol’s prints pass the “transformativeness” test and fall under an exception to copyright known as “fair use”. A narrowing of this exemption would have implications for copyright throughout the art world.
