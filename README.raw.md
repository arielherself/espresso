<strong>Ukraine’s</strong> armed forces have [advanced](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/11/is-russia-on-the-run) to within 50km of the border with Russia, according to General Valery Zaluzhny, their commander-in-chief<em>.</em> The country’s troops have retaken more than 3,000 square kilometres of territory in 11 days, [recapturing](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/09/ukraine-seizes-the-initiative-in-the-east) over 20 towns and villages on Sunday alone. Bodies of civilians that bore signs of torture were found in the north-eastern region of Kharkiv, according to the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general.

<strong>Russia </strong>launched dozens of attacks on the <strong>Kharkiv</strong> region on Monday, suggesting an intensification of its response. Russian forces also [retaliated](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/11/is-russia-on-the-run) by attacking <strong>civilian infrastructure </strong>including power stations and water facilities. Power and water in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, were cut off on Sunday before being restored and then hit again on Monday. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said that attacks against utilities are meant “to deprive people of light and heat”.

President <strong>Joe Biden</strong> signed an executive order to supercharge America’s <strong>biotechnology </strong>industry by growing the country’s [biomanufacturing capacity](https://www.economist.com/business/american-biotechnology-is-booming/21803495), expanding the market for biobased products and boosting R&amp;D. An administration official said that the package was motivated by similar investments in other countries, especially China.

An empty capsule designed to carry tourists into space aboard the <strong>“New Shepard”</strong> rocket of [Blue Origin](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/06/07/what-counts-as-a-journey-into-space), the aspiring rocket firm of Jeff Bezos, disconnected itself during launch and descended safely back to earth using a parachute. The unplanned “anomaly” will be investigated by America’s Federal Aviation Administration before flights are allowed to resume.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Charles III </strong>delivered his first address to Britain’s parliament [as king](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/09/what-will-charles-do-now), promising to emulate his late mother’s “selfless duty”. The coffin bearing [<strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong>](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/08/the-death-of-elizabeth-ii-marks-the-end-of-an-era) was taken to Edinburgh; on Tuesday it will be flown to London, to lie in state at Westminster Hall for four days. The funeral will take place on September 19th.

<strong>Sweden’s general election</strong> remained [too close to call](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/12/swedens-election-remains-too-close-to-call) after nearly all voting stations reported their results. The far-right opposition bloc seemed to have won a narrow victory over the country’s left-wing parties. But the balance could still swing back as some early votes as well as those from abroad are counted, with a final result not expected before Wednesday.

<strong>Britain’s economy</strong> grew more slowly than expected in July. GDP increased by 0.2% in July, less than the median forecast of 0.4%. Growth was stagnant over the three months to July compared to the previous three months. Consumer and business activity has been dampened by [soaring inflation](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/08/11/britains-economy-is-taking-a-drubbing).

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 350, the weight in kilograms of a HARM missile being used by Ukraine against Russia in its current counter-offensive.

## Our model of the contest for Congress

On November 8th America holds elections for one-third of the Senate and all 435 members in the House. To predict the outcome, each day <em>The Economist</em>’s [election model](https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-midterms-2022/forecast/senate) runs 10,000 simulated elections based on polling, demographics, fundraising and historical results. It currently gives the Democrats a 76% chance of holding the Senate, and the Republicans a 74% chance of taking the House. 

A few months ago the Democrats seemed poised to lose both. But the unpopular reversal of <em>Roe v Wade</em>, and the Republicans’ selection of unimpressive Senate candidates, have damaged the Republicans’ chances. The Democrats, meanwhile, passed some legislation and may be getting a boost as inflation slows. 

Our predictions may change. The Republicans have time to catch up. And in the 2020 election pollsters overestimated Democratic votes. But another factor may help the Democrats: fundraising. In nearly every tight Senate race, the Democratic candidates have received more donations than their opponents.

## Joe Biden’s war on cancer

It is 60 years since President John F. Kennedy gave a speech outlining America’s intention to land a man on the moon. Marking the anniversary, on Monday, [President Joe Biden](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/07/04/joe-biden-has-a-good-chance-of-becoming-a-surprisingly-activist-president) will set out his wish for renewed efforts on a similarly challenging endeavour—fighting cancer.

He first launched the Cancer Moonshot Initiative in 2016, as vice-president, a year after one of his sons, Beau, died of brain cancer. The scheme pledged $1.8bn in public funding over seven years to support a variety of efforts, such as improving therapeutics, detection and patient-driven care. Public funds continued to flow during Donald Trump’s administration.

In February the president relaunched the initiative, setting a goal of cutting the death rate from cancer in half by 2047. Better screening of potential patients is particularly pressing after an estimated 9.4m tests were missed in 2020 because of the pandemic. The fight against cancer is a rare bipartisan issue, though the public funds committed to this moonshot effort—while large—remain far short of those spent on getting to the actual moon.

## Imran Khan in court

Since he was ousted from office in April Imran Khan has become a fierce critic of Pakistan’s government. The former prime minister has staged [giant rallies](https://www.economist.com/1843/2022/08/25/on-the-comeback-trail-with-imran-khan), clamoured for fresh elections and served up intemperate speeches. That outspokenness has irritated those now in office, and brought him a barrage of criminal charges. On Monday final arguments in a critical court case resumed.  
  
 The former cricket star, who leads the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, faces both contempt and [terrorism charges](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/08/25/pakistans-government-wields-anti-terror-laws-against-imran-khan) related to a speech he made on August 20th in which he blamed police and a judge for the torture of one of his aides. 

Despite [catastrophic floods](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/08/30/pakistan-has-been-hit-by-its-worst-floods-in-recent-memory), which have cost more than 1,000 lives and $30bn in losses, many in Pakistan remain engrossed by this political drama. If Mr Khan were convicted on any of the charges, he would be disqualified from standing for office for five years. A technicality may take him down, but his support on the streets will not be diminished.

## Famine at the door in Somalia

[Somalia](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/07/25/somalia-is-on-the-brink-of-starvation) is in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. The search for food has driven 1m Somalis from their homes and some children are dying. A technical definition of a famine is where at least 20% of households face an extreme lack of food, 30% of children are suffering from acute malnutrition, and two people for every 10,000 dying each day because of starvation or malnutrition and disease. An independent panel, composed of UN experts, members of NGOs and academics, last week decided that this threshold had not yet been met. But the situation is still dire. 

Last week the UN’s humanitarian chief said that to avert a famine $1bn in new donations would be needed, on top of $1.5bn it had previously called for. Much of that first appeal has been raised. In July America [committed $476m. ](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/28/somalia-needs-urgent-help-to-avert-a-catastrophic-famine)But with an Islamist insurgency complicating relief efforts and rains next month expected yet again to fail, the help, however generous, may not come soon enough.

## America’s television gongs

The Emmy Awards have become a battleground in the streaming wars. Each year the combatants—notably Amazon, Apple, Disney, HBO, Hulu and Netflix—hope that by winning an armful of golden statuettes, they might also persuade subscribers that their platform hosts the best content. The prizes are to be dished out on Monday.

[Last year](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2020/09/21/despite-a-changed-television-landscape-the-emmys-had-a-familiar-feel) the contest had a clear winner: Netflix scooped up 44 prizes, followed by HBO with 19. Netflix’s triumph was largely down to “The Crown” and [“The Queen’s Gambit”](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/11/13/the-queens-gambit-is-right-young-chess-stars-always-usurp-the-old), which together accounted for half of the streaming service’s haul. This year it is [“Succession”](https://www.economist.com/culture/2021/10/29/the-success-of-succession-proves-the-virtue-of-hateful-characters), HBO’s flagship show, that should do well. The drama has already won ten Emmys since it first aired in 2018; it is up for 25 awards. (Look out for gongs for Best Drama Series and Best Supporting Actor.) Apple’s “Ted Lasso”, meanwhile, may continue to dominate the comedy categories. Executives and investors (and, who knows, perhaps even regular viewers) will be watching closely.
