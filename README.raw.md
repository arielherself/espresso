<strong>Jair Bolsonaro</strong> had yet to concede defeat in<strong> Brazil’s</strong> presidential election nearly 24 hours after <strong>Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva </strong>was [declared the winner](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/31/lula-will-be-brazils-next-president-now-for-the-hard-part). Mr Bolsonaro, the right-wing incumbent, suggested during the campaign that vote-rigging could yield an illegitimate result, raising fears about an orderly transfer of power should he lose. Lula won with 50.9% of the vote.

A majority of justices on America’s <strong>Supreme Court</strong> appeared sceptical of universities’ use of race as a factor in admissions. Plaintiffs in the two cases at hand say the practice, known as <strong>affirmative action</strong>, discriminates against Asian Americans. The court has repeatedly upheld its legality, but has recently shown a willingness to ditch [decades-old precedent](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/09/29/what-to-expect-from-the-new-scotus-term). A decision is expected in June.

Annualised <strong>inflation </strong>in the eurozone hit a new record in October, soaring to 10.7%, according to Eurostat, the EU’s statistics bureau. The jump was partly fuelled by [rising energy costs](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/30/europes-energy-crisis-is-very-far-from-over), which grew 41.9% year-on-year, compared with a 40.7% rise in September. The data will increase pressure on the European Central Bank to raise interest rates again at its next decision in December. The bank raised rates by 0.75 percentage points last week.

<strong>Donald Trump</strong> asked the Supreme Court to block House lawmakers from seeing his <strong>tax returns</strong>, which a lower court had said they could access by Thursday. Separately, at a [tax-fraud trial](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/05/how-much-legal-jeopardy-is-donald-trump-in) against the former president’s real-estate business, prosecutors accused the Trump Organisation of “cheating” at the “highest level”. Lawyers for the company said only its chief financial officer was guilty of tax evasion, not Mr Trump.

Ukrainian officials said that 12 ships carrying grain had left the country’s ports as planned on Monday. <strong>Turkey</strong>, <strong>Ukraine</strong> and the <strong>UN</strong> vowed to press ahead with the Black Sea grain deal, despite [Russia withdrawing](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/30/putin-suspends-a-deal-to-allow-grain-exports-from-ukraine) after claiming that Ukrainian drones had attacked Russian ships. Its withdrawal provoked outrage from the West and raised fears of global starvation.

Advertisers warned Elon Musk, the new owner of <strong>Twitter</strong>, not to relax [content moderation](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/10/28/elon-musk-buys-twitter-at-last) on the social media platform. The Global Alliance for Responsible Media, an advertising-industry initiative, said that moderation was “[non-negotiable](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/31/how-will-elon-musk-shape-twitter)” for brands. Advertisement is a major source of Twitter’s revenue. Meanwhile, Mr Musk reportedly plans to charge users for having their accounts verified with a blue tick.

<strong>Shanghai Disney</strong> abruptly locked its gates to contain a <strong>covid-19 outbreak</strong>, trapping visitors inside until they can show a negative test. (Rides, at least, are still operating.) Earlier, videos showed workers fleeing a huge <strong>iPhone-assembly plant</strong> in Zhengzhou, in central China, as the facility endured its own covid outbreak. China shows no sign of abandoning its zero-covid policy, despite the [damage to its economy](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/10/13/china-shows-few-signs-of-loosening-its-zero-covid-policy).

<strong>Fact of the day</strong>: $1.7trn, the amount President Joe Biden has pledged to spend in bills on infrastructure, semiconductors and the environment over the next decade.

## Affirmative action’s last stand

Since 1978, America’s Supreme Court has allowed the limited use of racial preferences in university admissions to foster the educational benefits of diversity. In 2003 and 2016, legal challenges to affirmative action fell one vote short in the highest court. But on Monday a pair of cases, involving Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, give the justices another opportunity to nix race-conscious admissions. The court’s six Republican-appointed members were a receptive audience.

Students for Fair Admissions, the plaintiff in both suits, is the brainchild of Edward Blum, a conservative activist who brought the previous cases, too. SFFA argues that <em>Grutter v Bollinger</em>, the 2003 decision, is “egregiously wrong” and must be overturned. Harvard’s tip for black and Hispanic students is not modest but “mammoth”, the organisation says, and “discriminates against Asian Americans”. Harvard counters that its policies “fully align” with the constitutional requirement of equal protection and reflect “common-sense reality, not stereotype”. 

## Ukraine’s grain exports

Twelve ships packed with grain left Ukraine’s ports on Monday, despite Russia pulling out of a deal guaranteeing safe passage through the Black Sea. Not a single ship was able to leave on Sunday after Russia announced on Saturday that it was suspending its participation in the UN-brokered agreement in response to a Ukrainian attack on its Black Sea fleet earlier that day. 

Turkey, Ukraine and the UN insist exports must continue. Since early August, when the deal came into effect, Ukraine has been able to export more than 9m tonnes of grain, saving its farmers from bankruptcy. The agreement has also eased a global food shortage, brought down prices and prevented some 100m people from falling into extreme poverty, according to the UN. Its collapse would undo many of those gains. It may also expose Ukraine’s ports, whose waters have been de-mined to allow ships to pass, to new Russian attacks.

## Some good news for Italy’s new government

Italy’s latest GDP figures showed an unexpectedly strong performance in the third quarter. The economy was reckoned to have grown by 0.5% quarter-on-quarter. Parliament’s budgetary committee had braced for a 0.2% drop. The national statistical office said the preliminary indications pointed to a big boost from services. Italy has benefited from the surge in tourism that has followed the lifting of restrictions imposed during the pandemic.

Today’s figures nevertheless mean that annual growth is down (to 2.6% from 4.9% at the end of the previous quarter). And they reflect only partially the effect of rapidly rising prices. In October, the annual rate of consumer inflation leapt to 12.8% from 9.4% a month earlier. The energy-driven inflation affecting the whole of Europe is among several economic headaches for [Giorgia Meloni’s](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/27/storm-clouds-loom-for-giorgia-meloni-italys-new-prime-minister) newly installed right-wing government. And with Italy already owing more than 150% of GDP, there is a limit to how much she can spend without unsettling investors.

## Hong Kong’s financial summit mired in covid

After more than two years largely sealed off from the outside world, and a violent [crackdown on democracy](https://www.economist.com/interactive/essay/2022/07/01/how-hong-kong-became-a-police-state), Hong Kong’s reputation has taken a beating. But the government hopes to revive its vulnerable status as Asia’s top commercial hub this week with a high-profile summit of global leaders from the finance industry.

The Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit will be a hard sell. Hong Kong is still physically isolated from mainland China as a result of[ zero-covid policies](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/04/16/the-way-chinese-think-about-covid-19-is-changing), threatening its traditional role as a business gateway to the mainland economy. Wall Street bosses are among the attendees, but some will be notable by their absence. Covid-19 diagnoses will keep the head of Citigroup, Jane Fraser, and the president of Blackstone, Jonathan Gray, away. Hong Kong still requires multiple tests for visitors and enforced isolation for those testing positive. Paul Chan, the city’s financial secretary, aims to attend despite having contracted covid on a trip to Saudi Arabia. Zero-covid, it seems, still means lots of covid.

## Meret Oppenheim’s storm in a teacup

Meret Oppenheim was 22 and chatting with Pablo Picasso and Dora Maar in a Paris café when she dreamt up the artwork that would make her famous: a fur-covered cup, saucer and spoon that she called “Object”. Hailed as quintessentially surrealist, this playfully erotic and unnerving sculpture caused a sensation for decades. Yet Oppenheim herself, who died in 1985, has largely escaped notice. 

“Meret Oppenheim: My Exhibition”, a grand survey of more than 180 works at New York’s Museum of Modern Art, should fix this error of omission. The show arrives at a time when curators everywhere have become fascinated again by the Freudian dreamscapes of surrealism, and keen on highlighting the often overlooked work of women. A few years into her star turn as a surrealist, Oppenheim broke free from a movement that often dismissed women as muses, only to continue innovating in semi-obscurity. “Nobody will give you freedom,” she observed. “You have to take it.”
