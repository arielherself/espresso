<strong>The leaders of the G7</strong>, a group of rich democracies, pledged their “undeterred and steadfast” financial and military support for <strong>Ukraine</strong> at an emergency meeting a day after a barrage of [Russian missiles](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/10/russia-launches-a-wave-of-missiles-across-ukraine) rained down on Ukrainian cities. In a joint statement the group warned of “severe consequences” if Russia were to deploy chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. Meanwhile NATO’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said his organisation was “not seeing any changes” in Russia’s nuclear posture.

The <strong>IMF</strong> downgraded its forecast for <strong>global economic growth </strong>next year by 0.2 percentage points, to 2.7%. Blaming efforts to manage [soaring inflation](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/29/markets-are-reeling-from-higher-rates-the-world-economy-is-next), [Russia’s war in Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/08/04/by-how-much-will-the-war-in-ukraine-reduce-global-growth) and [China’s slowdown](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/20/chinas-rulers-seem-resigned-to-a-slowing-economy), a report warned that a third of the global economy may tip into recession by next year. The forecast for 3.2% growth in 2022 remained unchanged.

President <strong>Joe Biden</strong> will “re-evaluate” America’s relationship with <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> after the kingdom’s decision to reduce oil production, a White House official said. Last week the Saudi-led OPEC+ bloc of petroleum producers announced it would[ cut output by 2m barrels per day](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/05/opec-defies-joe-biden-with-a-big-output-cut), despite sky-high prices. Mr Biden is reportedly considering retaliatory measures such as curbing arms sales and stripping OPEC members of immunity to American antitrust laws.

<strong>China</strong> has ramped up [anti-covid measures](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/09/08/public-patience-with-zero-covid-is-wearing-thin-in-china) in some big cities ahead of the Communist Party’s [five-yearly congress](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/29/how-to-make-sense-of-xi-jinping-chinas-enigmatic-ruler), which begins in Beijing on Sunday. To counter an uptick in infections after the National Day holiday [Shanghai](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/06/30/getting-around-covid-controls-in-shanghai) has locked down some neighbourhoods, closed entertainment venues and tourist attractions and will double the frequency of its mass testing. Other local authorities have closed schools.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Israel </strong>and <strong>Lebanon</strong> struck an agreement to settle a [maritime border dispute](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/21/mediterranean-gas-sends-sparks-flying-between-lebanon-and-israel). While limited in scope, the US-brokered deal paves the way for offshore gas exploration in the eastern Mediterranean. Yair Lapid, the Israeli Prime Minister, called the deal “historic”. Hizbullah, an Iranian-backed Lebanese militia which threatened military escalation if the dispute was not resolved in Lebanon’s favour, reportedly backed the government’s position.

<strong>The Bank of England</strong> widened its emergency bond-buying intervention to counter sell-offs by pension funds that threaten Britain’s financial stability. The scheme was introduced in response to the government’s [reckless mini-budget](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically). Separately, Britain’s <strong>unemployment rate </strong>fell to 3.5% in the quarter ending in August, its lowest level in nearly 50 years. Wages increased by 5.4% year on year, but continue to lag behind inflation.

<strong>Tulsi Gabbard</strong>, a former four-term [congresswoman from Hawaii](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2019/10/28/why-democrats-are-talking-about-tulsi-gabbard), announced that she had left the Democratic Party, which she described as “an elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness”. She accused the organisation, which she sought to represent as presidential candidate in 2020 before dropping out and endorsing Joe Biden, of “anti-white racism” and hostility towards religious Americans.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>13%, the average dip in earnings per share around recessions since the second world war, according to Goldman Sachs. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/10/09/have-profits-peaked-at-american-businesses).

## Russia doubles down in Ukraine

The G7, a club of rich democracies, will hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. The hastily convened session is in response to Russia’s [missile attack](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/10/russia-launches-a-wave-of-missiles-across-ukraine) on civilian infrastructure and cities in Ukraine on Monday which killed at least 14 people and injured almost 100 more. The European Union said that such attacks constitute war crimes. The G7 will consider what further pressure can be applied to Russia to stop its assault.

Monday’s missiles were [retaliation](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/08/ukraine-braces-for-retaliation-after-an-attack-on-the-bridge-from-crimea-to-russia) for an attack on a bridge linking Crimea with Russia. But many worry that the bloodshed heralds a new chapter in an already cruel war. It appears to be a statement of intent from President Vladimir Putin and Sergei Surovikin, the general appointed on Saturday as overall Russian commander of the war. General Surovikin has a well-earned reputation for brutality and ruthlessness. One Ukrainian official says he has studied the general’s involvement in Afghanistan, two Chechen wars and Russia’s air war in Syria and had come to a grim conclusion: “He’s a butcher.”

## Meta’s metaverse conference

Nearly a year has passed since the company once known as Facebook renamed itself Meta. The rebranding was meant to signal the firm’s multi-billion-dollar, multi-year shift in focus towards the [“metaverse”](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/05/11/what-is-the-metaverse), a loose [term](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/07/27/in-the-metaverse-matthew-ball-explains-where-the-idea-came-from) envisioning an immersive, virtual-reality driven internet. The [huge investment](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/02/04/metamorphosis-facebook-and-big-tech-competition), together with flagging revenues in Meta’s core social-networking businesses, which include Instagram and WhatsApp as well as Facebook, have sent profits and shares tumbling. 

Does the firm have anything to show yet for its big bet? Investors and consumers will find out on Tuesday at Meta Connect, where progress on Meta’s virtual- and augmented-reality technologies will be revealed. These are likely to include an upgraded and pricier version of the Quest virtual-reality headset. Meta is also expected to unveil improvements to Horizon, a virtual-reality social network released last year for Quest users. Screenshots from Horizon of a cartoonish, poorly rendered version of Mark Zuckerberg, the company&#x27;s founder, became a meme this summer.

## Japan reopens to foreign tourists

More than two years of [pandemic-induced isolation](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/07/what-pandemic-border-closures-say-about-japans-view-of-outsiders) have ended in Japan. From Tuesday travellers from dozens of countries will be able to enter without visas and move around without government-approved guides. 

Japan’s government hopes tourists will help reinvigorate a flagging economy. Some 32m foreigners visited Japan in 2019; inbound tourism spending amounted to nearly ¥5trn ($34bn today). The country had planned for 40m arrivals in 2020, with the summer Olympics in Tokyo. Instead, just 4m entered; last year the number dipped to below 250,000.

The yen being at its weakest level against the dollar in nearly 25 years may inspire shopping sprees. Airlines are increasing flights to Japan. But one lucrative group will not be back just yet. In 2019 Chinese tourists accounted for 28% of arrivals and 37% of tourist spending. But their government is still restricting travel abroad. Without them, Japan’s tourism industry may yet take years to recover.

## The fattest bears in Alaska

Fat Bear Tuesday marks the climax of [Fat Bear Week](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/10/04/alaskas-fat-bear-week-proves-conservation-can-be-joyful), a contest run by Katmai National Park in southern Alaska to identify the brown bear who gains the most weight while preparing for hibernation. Fans share before and after photos of the bears, taken from webcams, and then vote. The final round, to crown a winner, will be between 747, a male nicknamed “Bear Force One”, and 901, a young female. 

The contest, which began in 2014, serves a purpose besides ogling champion chunksters. The park’s webcams bring [Alaska’s wilderness](https://www.economist.com/essay/2022/09/08/the-alaskan-wilderness-reveals-the-past-and-the-future) to people who otherwise may never see it. It also draws attention to conservation. Katmai’s 2,200 bears are so rotund because they feed from a healthy salmon run, untouched by overfishing and [dam construction](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/07/08/in-the-pacific-north-west-hydroelectric-dams-are-being-removed). Park rangers argue the joyful contest has gone viral because it helps dispel gloomy feelings about habitat loss and climate change. May the fattest bear win.

## Damien Hirst burns his art

On Tuesday morning [Damien Hirst](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2017/04/15/damien-hirsts-new-art-is-exquisitely-crafted), a British artist, will begin burning a collection of paintings valued at about $10m as the finale of “The Currency”, his project pitting physical art against [non-fungible tokens](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/10/12/what-is-an-nft).

Last year 10,000 of Mr Hirst’s paintings featuring colourful enamel spots, made in 2016, were made into digital files, known as NFTs. Each NFT was sold for $2,000 but buyers were later given the choice between keeping the NFT or swapping it for the painting. Unwanted paintings are now being burned and rejected NFTs deleted.  
  
 In all 9,000 works were sold to the public: 5,149 buyers chose paintings while 3,851 wanted the NFTs. (Mr Hirst kept the rest.) Fewer than 70 physical works have appeared at auction, fetching twice the price of the more than 2,000 NFTs that have been resold. If “The Currency” asks whether digital works are as valuable as tangible ones, the answer seems to be no.
