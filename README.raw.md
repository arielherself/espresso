<strong>Jerome Powell</strong>, chair of the Federal Reserve, set out a hawkish tone on tackling [inflation](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/05/for-a-change-american-inflation-is-lower-than-expected) in America, speaking at an annual gathering of central bankers at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. He admitted that curbs could result in “a sustained period of below-trend growth” but that America’s central bank “must keep at it until the job is done”. In July [the Fed](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/07/27/the-fed-is-no-longer-taking-baby-steps-to-rein-in-inflation) announced its second consecutive 0.75 percentage point rate rise.

<strong>Moderna</strong>, an American pharmaceutical company, sued its rival, Pfizer, and its German collaborator [BioNTech](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/08/10/after-a-covid-fuelled-adrenaline-rush-biotech-is-crashing) over alleged patent infringement while developing their covid-19 vaccine, the first in the world. Moderna said that the companies infringed on patents filed between 2010 and 2016 covering innovative <strong>mRNA technology</strong>; it clarified that it was not seeking to block the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine from the market.

The Russian-occupied [Zaporizhia nuclear plant](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/19/what-is-at-stake-at-ukraines-zaporizhia-nuclear-plant) in <strong>Ukraine</strong> was reconnected to the national grid, according to the country&#x27;s atomic energy agency, after it was temporarily disconnected in a fire triggered by artillery shelling. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said Europe narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster”. The UN’s nuclear watchdog said its officials were “very, very close” to being able to visit Europe’s largest nuclear plant to assess the situation.

<strong>America </strong>and <strong>China </strong>reached a landmark deal to enable American regulators to inspect audits of Chinese companies listed on its exchanges. The agreement, which comes after more than a decade of stalled talks, could prevent hundreds of US-listed [Chinese stocks](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/07/22/chinas-newest-technology-stock-exchange-is-thriving-despite-the-pandemic) from being delisted for not making their books available for audit for three consecutive years. In August five of China’s state-owned companies said they would opt to delist.

Ofgem, Britain’s energy watchdog, increased the country’s <strong>energy</strong> price cap by 80%, pushing up the typical household’s [energy bill](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/08/26/energy-bills-in-britain-are-soaring) to £3,549 ($4,186) a year. The new prices will kick in from October 1st. Jonathan Brearley, the regulator’s chief executive, said there was “no choice” but to increase the cap to reflect the soaring price of energy. The new prices will kick in from October 1st.

<strong>America’s Department of Justice</strong> unsealed the affidavit that authorised the search of <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s Mar-a-Lago estate earlier this month. The heavily redacted version, written by an FBI special agent, claimed there was “probable cause” to believe that Trump had not returned [additional classified documents](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/10/the-raid-on-mar-a-lago-could-shake-americas-foundations), and that “evidence of obstruction” would be found at his home. 

<strong>Morocco</strong> recalled its ambassador to <strong>Tunisia</strong> “for consultations” after Tunisian president Kais Saied welcomed Brahim Ghali, the head of a local separatist movement, at Tunis airport. Morocco’s foreign ministry denounced Tunisia’s “hostile and detrimental attitude” and pulled out of TICAD, a regional summit for Africa’s development. Last year it temporarily withdrew its ambassadors to Spain and Germany over the same issue. 

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>$217.1bn, the amount that American state governments saved in 2021, exceeding the 2019 record by nearly $100bn. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/25/states-have-historic-amounts-of-leftover-cash).

## Joe Biden’s long game in Ukraine

America marked [Ukraine’s](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/08/14/a-ukrainian-counter-offensive-in-kherson-faces-steep-odds) independence day by announcing its largest package of military aid yet, worth about $3bn, to buy everything from artillery shells to air-defence systems. Unusually, the arms will not come from existing arsenals, but will instead be bought from industry. Some might not arrive for three years. The aid will do nothing to break the current stalemate after [half a year of fighting](https://www.economist.com/interactive/europe/2022/08/24/six-months-of-war-in-ukraine). Instead, America is signalling a years-long commitment to Ukraine, thereby seeking to frustrate Russia’s hope of prevailing in a drawn-out conflict.

[Fear of escalation](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/08/02/what-would-push-the-west-and-russia-to-nuclear-war) explains America’s caution in not sending more potent weapons to Ukraine more quickly. But a long game carries other risks. European allies might break ranks when energy shortages begin to hurt this winter. America’s will to bankroll Ukraine may weaken, particularly if America-first devotees control Congress after the midterms in November. And a [long war](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/06/30/does-a-protracted-conflict-favour-russia-or-ukraine) will prolong the agony of Ukraine. 

## Italy papers the town with posters

Friday brings the beginning of Italy’s [general election campaign](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/28/italys-next-government-may-be-more-nationalist-than-europe-likes): the day it becomes legal to smother towns and cities with election posters. Notwithstanding television and social media, fly-posting is an important part of Italian elections, as are mass rallies. Polls point to a dramatic outcome: the election, for the first time in post-war western Europe, of a government led by a party rooted in the traditions of a pre-war dictatorship. 

The latest surveys give the [Brothers of Italy](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/08/11/can-anything-stop-italys-radical-right), heirs to the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement, around 25% of the vote. Their allies in the hard-right Northern League and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party could together get a further 25%, enough for a commanding parliamentary majority. On Thursday the outgoing prime minister, [Mario Draghi](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/21/mario-draghi-italys-reformist-prime-minister-resigns), warned his successors that distancing Italy from the EU would weaken its economy and international standing. But Italian voters seem ready to dismiss such fears.

## A pushback against impunity in Malaysia

Najib Razak has begun his [12-year sentence in prison for graft](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/25/a-brazen-kleptocrat-has-gone-to-jail-in-malaysia-he-must-stay-there), but not everyone wants justice to take its course. The former prime minister’s loyalists within the ruling United Malays National Organisation seem unperturbed by his role in a [mega-scandal](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/08/23/malaysias-disgraced-former-prime-minister-is-going-to-prison) in which $4.5bn was swiped from Malaysian state coffers—and are furious that the prime minister, Ismail Sabri Yaakob, stood idly by as Mr Najib was jailed. They are calling for a royal pardon, which would allow Mr Najib back into parliament. And they are telling Mr Ismail Sabri to call an early election or face a party mutiny.

It seems Mr Ismail Sabri has listened. On Friday he tabled an early budget for October 7th, a necessary measure to pave the way for a November election. That gives the faction behind Mr Najib the chance to wrest control of the party and the government. It would also give Malaysians their say on all the squabbling and sleaze.

## Britain anticipates the chill of winter bills

Britons face a bleak winter of [steeper energy bills](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/08/26/energy-bills-in-britain-are-soaring). On Friday they found out just how pricey energy will be, when Ofgem, the regulator, updated its cap on how much energy companies can charge most households for electricity and gas. The war in Ukraine has pushed wholesale gas prices to dizzying heights again ([prices dropped](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/05/19/wholesale-gas-prices-in-britain-have-collapsed) earlier in the summer). The average household’s annual bill will rise to £3,549 ($4,180) from October, more than three times the level a year ago.

Labour, the main opposition party, says it would freeze annual bills for six months at £1,971 for the typical household, with the government paying the excess. The idea is popular, but [expensive](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/08/18/why-labours-silly-energy-policy-is-smart-politics)—the state would pay around £6bn towards the bills of the top 20% of earners. A better solution is giving rebates or cash bonuses to the poorest (though targeting help effectively is tricky). If done well, that would encourage people to conserve energy, but still insulate those most in need.

## America’s abortions bans proliferate

Two months after America’s Supreme Court ditched the right to abortion, more states are banning the procedure. Thirteen had so-called trigger laws automatically outlawing abortion after [<em>Roe v Wade</em>](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/06/24/the-supreme-courts-rejection-of-roe-will-hurt-the-poorest-most) was overturned. On Thursday Tennessee banned abortion without exceptions for rape or incest. Texas also stiffened enforcement of a similar law: doctors now face minimum fines of $100,000 per termination and risk spending life in prison.

But some bans are being fiercely contested. On Wednesday a judge ruled that Idaho’s near-total prohibition, set to take effect this week, violated a federal law requiring hospitals to provide emergency medical care. Court battles have paused abortion bans in Utah, Wyoming and North Dakota, where one such law had been scheduled to take effect on Friday. Still, the list of states with existing or pending bans continues to lengthen: one in three [American women of childbearing age](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/19/americas-already-dreadful-maternal-mortality-rate-looks-set-to-rise) now lives in such a place.
