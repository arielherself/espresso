<strong>Iran’s</strong> attorney-general said that the country would abolish its hateful <strong>morality police</strong>, whose tasks include ensuring that women wear the hijab. Many observers were sceptical—as responsibility for the force lies with the interior ministry, which remained schtum, not the judiciary—but, if true, it would be a sign that the government [was bowing](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/04/irans-rattled-government-may-be-backing-down) to three months of protests. Meanwhile, demonstrators called for a three-day strike this week.

The [G7’s cap](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/30/the-wests-proposed-price-cap-on-russian-oil-is-no-magic-weapon) on the <strong>price of oil </strong>bought from <strong>Russia</strong>, to which the EU and Australia agreed on Friday, went into effect on Monday. It bars the sale of Russian crude bought for more than $60 a barrel. In the meantime <strong>OPEC </strong>and its allies had elected not to lift their production targets; the oil-producing cartel is waiting to ascertain the price cap’s impact.

<strong>China</strong> began slowly distancing itself from its <strong>zero-covid</strong> dictum, following [unprecedented protests](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/12/01/lessons-from-a-chinese-protest) against the government’s once unyielding policies. The long-locked-down city of Urumqi in Xinjiang region, where the unrest began, started reopening malls and restaurants on Monday. Some other big cities will no longer require a negative covid test to board public transport. Chinese stockmarkets cheered the hopeful signals.

Britain’s <strong>Labour Party</strong> set out a plan for “the biggest ever transfer of power” and wealth away from the government in Westminster and for sharing it across the country. [The opposition party’s](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/22/after-a-frosty-decade-business-leaders-are-warming-to-the-labour-party) proposals include scrapping the House of Lords, relocating 50,000 civil servants to outside London and giving devolved governments and local authorities more powers, including more say over spending.

<strong>Donald Trump </strong>called for the “termination” of <strong>America’s constitution</strong>, in service to the lie that he won the presidential election of 2020. On his own social-media network he said that revoking “all rules” might be necessary to reinstall himself in the White House (notwithstanding his new [electoral campaign](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/16/donald-trump-declares-that-he-will-make-america-great-again-again)). Mr Trump’s latest [anti-democratic tirade](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/10/27/why-the-republicans-anti-democracy-turn-has-become-normalised) elicited widespread condemnation—but silence from senior Republicans. 

Heavy rains caused a <strong>volcano</strong> to erupt on <strong>Indonesia’s</strong> main island, Java. It buried buildings with ash and debris and prompted the evacuation of about 2,000 people. Locals were advised to keep 8km from Mount Semeru as it blasted out hot clouds and poured down streams of lava. [Indonesia](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/11/14/indonesia-is-poised-for-a-boom-politics-permitting) experiences frequent [volcanic activity](https://www.economist.com/asia/2017/12/02/fiery-mount-agung-is-just-one-of-127-active-volcanoes-in-indonesia); Semeru last erupted a year ago, killing 51 people.

<strong>Football World Cup:</strong> After a group stage punctuated by a series of [extraordinary upsets](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/12/02/why-the-world-cups-first-stage-has-been-surprisingly-even), the first matches of the<strong> knockout round</strong> did not provide any shocks. <strong>England </strong>beat Senegal, whose star Sadio Mané is out of the tournament, and <strong>France</strong>, inspired by Kylian Mbappé, cruised past Poland. 

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>670, the amount of gold in tonnes that central banks bought from January to September. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/01/why-central-banks-are-stockpiling-gold).

## Squeezing Russian oil flows

On Monday, the EU’s ban on seaborne crude oil from Russia came into effect. At the same time, another complicated scheme to manipulate the energy markets has been negotiated, designed to slash the flow of petrodollars fuelling Russia’s war in Ukraine while avoiding a global oil-supply shock. 

European (and British) suppliers of tankers and insurance will be banned from providing services to vessels ferrying crude oil from Russia to non-EU countries. To ensure the ban does not decimate Russian exports and spark an oil-price shock, America proposed that such services could be made available to non-EU countries so long as they purchased seaborne Russian oil below an agreed price cap. After months of wrangling, on Friday the G7 club of rich countries, Australia and the EU agreed to a cap of $60 a barrel. But with Russia refusing to abide by any cap, it is [too soon](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/30/how-the-wests-price-cap-on-russian-oil-could-roil-energy-markets) for the West to declare victory.

## Transatlantic trade troubles

Europe has long urged America to do more in the fight against climate change. Now that it has, the EU is not happy. The bloc fears that President Joe Biden is following an “America First”, rather than a climate-first, approach. The [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/09/joe-bidens-signature-legislation-passes-the-senate-at-last), Mr Biden’s flagship policy, offers green incentives worth $400bn, but includes protectionist subsidies on key products like electric cars. On Monday a meeting in Washington between the EU and the Biden administration could offer hints on how the pair hope to resolve the dispute. 

The text of the law says that exceptions can be applied only to countries with which the United States has a free-trade agreement; America has no such deal with the EU. On Sunday the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, warned that the bloc must “adapt” its own state-aid rules in the face of America’s green subsidies. Not a good sign for the meeting. 

## Free speech v gay rights at SCOTUS

Four years after sidestepping the crux of a dispute between a gay couple and a Christian baker who refused to make them a wedding cake, America’s Supreme Court is taking another crack at the subject. On Monday the justices will examine the case of 303 Creative v Elenis. The question is: does the First Amendment protect a web designer who says her beliefs about marriage preclude her from creating websites for gay weddings? 

Lorie Smith, the designer, says “sacred freedoms of thought and mind” bar the state of Colorado from forcing her to create messages that clash with her beliefs. The state counters that the law only requires Ms Smith to supply gay customers with the same services she offers straight ones. She could insist on selling only websites containing “biblical passages stating that marriage is a union of one man and one woman” as long as she sells them “to everyone”. Tricky questions at the heart of America’s culture wars await: if a business can refuse to carry out work involving same-sex weddings, why not interracial ones, too?

## China’s faltering economy

On Monday China’s central bank freed up 500bn yuan ($72bn) for lending within the banking system, after announcing a 25-basis-point cut to the required reserve ratio, the amount of money banks are required to hold as reserves. In recent years the People’s Bank of China has routinely cut RRR to encourage banks to lend more. The hope is that there will be takers for the extra credit, but demand has been lacklustre in China’s [decelerating economy](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2015/03/11/why-chinas-economy-is-slowing). Covid restrictions have caused companies great uncertainty. Many planned investments in factories or new shops have been axed. In October new loans declined to 615bn yuan, 211bn yuan less than a year ago.

That is worrying for the government, which in its quest for growth wants companies to expand operations and build factories. Until China fixes its covid problem, RRR cuts might amount to little more than pushing on a string.

## Picking the word of the year

At this time of year, as others are trimming Christmas trees, a clutch of dictionary publishers ponder their choice for word of the year. Oxford Dictionaries revealed theirs on Monday: “goblin mode”. That means a state in which someone indulges their laziest or most self-indulgent habits—perhaps suitable as a symbol for the first proper post-lockdown year. 

For the first time ever, the word of the year was selected by public vote. “Goblin mode” beat two of Oxford&#x27;s other choices. One was “#IStandWith”, a hashtag used frequently in solidarity on Twitter but whose status as a word seems questionable. Another was the “metaverse”, the name of a thing which Meta (owner of Facebook) and other companies have poured fortunes into developing—but which few people seem to be actually spending time in. It has been a strange year: war, economic upheaval and a pandemic hangover are hard to sum up in a single dictionary entry. Perhaps 2023 will bring better news, and more inspiring words.
