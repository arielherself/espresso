The warrant used by the FBI to search <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> home was issued because America’s Department of Justice said it believed that Mr Trump violated <strong>the Espionage Act</strong>, which prohibits the possession or transmission of national security information. Mr Trump did not object to a request by Merrick Garland, the attorney-general, that a Florida court unseal the warrant. The agents who [searched Mar-a-Lago](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/09/an-fbi-raid-on-donald-trumps-home-ignites-a-political-firestorm) reportedly removed 11 sets of classified documents, including material marked “top secret” and information on France’s president, Emmanuel Macron.

Sir Salman Rushdie, the Booker-prizewinning [novelist](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/09/05/salman-rushdies-new-novel-is-a-metafictional-romp), was stabbed several times when he was about to deliver a lecture in Chautauqua, in upstate New York. Sir Salman was airlifted to hospital; his agent said he was put on a ventilator and may lose an eye. The attacker has been taken into police custody. “The Satanic Verses”, the author’s fourth novel, inspired condemnation upon its release in 1988. Some Muslims judged it blasphemous, and Iran called for his death. 

America’s <strong>House of Representatives</strong> approved a $430bn climate, tax and health-care bill, delivering a boost for President Joe Biden ahead of November’s mid-term elections. The <strong>Inflation Reduction Act</strong> is the largest package of climate spending in American history, providing $369bn of support for renewable energy and other green infrastructure. It also aims to lower prescription drug prices and raise taxes on some big firms.

America will unveil a new trade plan with <strong>Taiwan </strong>in the coming days, the White House said, intended to deepen ties with the island. Tensions between America, China and Taiwan have been high since Nancy Pelosi, an American politician, visited Taiwan earlier this month. A trip by China’s president, Xi Jinping, reportedly being planned for November, may include a first face-to-face meeting with his American counterpart Joe Biden since the latter became president.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Idaho</strong>’s Supreme Court refused a bid to halt a Republican-backed state law that brings in a near-total ban on <strong>abortion</strong>. Around half of states have or are expected to ban or limit abortion rights following the decision by America’s Supreme Court to overturn <em>[Roe v Wade](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/06/24/the-supreme-courts-rejection-of-roe-will-hurt-the-poorest-most)</em>. Idaho’s measure, which takes effect on August 25th, will allow abortions only in cases of rape, incest or to prevent a pregnant woman’s death. 

The two road bridges into <strong>Kherson</strong>, a city in southern <strong>Ukraine </strong>occupied by Russian forces, are out of use for military supplies, according to British intelligence. Ukraine has for weeks hinted that a counter-attack is imminent, but it faces steep odds to retake the city. Russia has been reinforcing defensive positions throughout the south of the country.

Five <strong>Chinese state-owned firms</strong> will apply to <strong>delist </strong>from the New York Stock Exchange, including China Life Insurance and two energy giants, PetroChina and Sinopec. All five failed to meet American auditing standards earlier this year. The price of other Chinese stocks listed in America tumbled in response to the news. Sino-American tensions are [running high](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/08/11/how-the-crisis-over-taiwan-will-change-us-china-relations) following the visit of Nancy Pelosi, an American politician, [to Taiwan](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/11/how-to-prevent-a-war-between-america-and-china-over-taiwan).

<strong><em>Correction:</em></strong><em> our “Fact of the day” on Friday incorrectly attributed an increase in violent crimes involving guns to states in America where right-to-carry laws were struck down. The increase was actually in states where the laws were adopted. Sorry</em>

## The Aloha State votes

More Hawaiians than usual may vote in the state’s primary elections on Saturday. Hawaii began mailing ballots to voters in 2020 to boost its turnout, the lowest in America. By August 9th, 25% of ballots had already been returned.

The surge of new voters is unlikely to help the Republican Party in a state that is deep blue. David Ige, the governor, and all four members of Congress are Democrats. Mr Ige has reached his term limit but his replacement will probably be Joshua Green, his current deputy. Brian Schatz, one of the Senate’s loudest voices for climate-change legislation, should also glide to victory in his primary. Should they win their general-election races in November, they will have much to do. The pandemic battered the state’s tourism-dependent economy, the Ukraine war strained its[ energy supplies](https://www.economist.com/united-states/hawaiis-oil-dependent-economy-is-being-battered-by-russias-war/21808955)—petrol is costlier in Hawaii than in any other state—and a perennial shortage of affordable housing has worsened. The Aloha State is blue in more ways than one.

## Warranted action: dissecting the FBI raid

Four days after the FBI searched Donald Trump’s home at Mar-a-Lago, in Florida, more details are emerging. It was ostensibly part of an investigation into the ex-president’s alleged removal of classified documents from the White House when he left it. An inventory list from the search warrant, unsealed on Friday and leaked to several newspapers, showed that FBI agents seized 11 sets of documents, some marked “top secret”, meaning they may not leave secure government-approved facilities. 

The most explosive detail is not what was in the boxes—which included Mr Trump’s pardon of Roger Stone, one of his fixers, and “info re: the President of France”. Rather it is the three statutes under which the warrant was granted. One was against “gathering, transmitting or losing defence information”. That law is part of the Espionage Act. Why Mr Trump may have taken the documents, and whether charges will follow, is unknown. But could he be indicted on laws against spying?

## Dark days for the All Blacks

The All Blacks, New Zealand’s men’s rugby union team, has a compelling claim to be the best sports team ever. Since their first game in 1903, they have won more than 75% of the matches they have played, and three World Cups. By those high standards, recent results have been disastrous. In July they lost a series at home to Ireland. Last week they lost in South Africa. The second (and final) match in that series is played on Saturday. Ian Foster, the coach, needs a win to keep his job.

But there are also structural weaknesses hurting the team. Changes to the domestic club-level competition have cut off exposure to sides from outside the Pacific. Participation rates are falling as kids turn to other sports. The team’s financial future may be secure, thanks to a private-equity injection of $129m earlier this year. But a return to all-conquering form, especially before the World Cup in 2023, looks far less certain. 

## A film musician goes solo

Danny Elfman, legendary composer of nearly 100 Hollywood film scores, including the soundtracks of “Good Will Hunting” and “Spider-Man”, this week releases a solo album. “Bigger. Messier.” comprises reworked versions of songs from “Big Mess”, an industrial art-rock LP released last year, and features stars such as Iggy Pop and Trent Reznor. 

This is not the radical sideways step it may seem. Mr Elfman was leader of a new-wave band called Oingo Boingo when two Hollywood fans, Tim Burton and Paul Reubens, invited him to score “Pee-wee’s Big Adventure”, a breakout hit in 1985.

Back then Mr Elfman wanted “to embrace film scoring from a classical approach”. That meant putting his rock instincts aside—until now. In this album, he says he is free to express himself. And that expression is 90 minutes of heavy-duty avant-garde electronica as epic and dramatic as any blockbuster movie.

## Weekend profile: Robert Habeck, Germany’s energy hero

Olaf Scholz may be Germany’s chancellor, but to many the man of the hour in Berlin is Robert Habeck, his vice-chancellor and minister for economy and climate change. This is not just because the senior-most Green in the three-party ruling coalition pips his boss in the polls: since this government took office in December Mr Habeck has consistently been named the country’s most popular politician. It is also because his job as energy supremo puts the chatty, studiedly casual 52-year-old on the front lines of the [biggest crisis](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/08/11/germany-is-facing-dramatic-change-in-many-dimensions-all-at-once) Germany has faced in a generation.

By most accounts Mr Habeck has done well. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February placed Germany in a dilemma. Decades of misguided policy had hooked Europe’s biggest economy on Russian fossil fuels. Pipelines from Siberia supplied 55% of its natural gas. But with a mix of charm, money and dealmaking, Mr Habeck has helped shield Germany from potential blackmail by trimming gas use and finding new suppliers. Enhancing his reputation for pragmatism (some would say lack of principle), the vice-chancellor muted his Green beliefs to reignite mothballed coal-fired power stations. A similar nose-holding green light may also keep Germany’s last three nuclear power plants open. They were to close in December as part of a longstanding plan to scrap nuclear power. Polls show even a majority of Green voters realise that, right now, that would be stupid.

Mr Habeck, who hails from Germany’s northernmost state, Schleswig-Holstein, earned a PhD in literature before entering politics. But it is his trademark three-day stubble, preference for open-necked shirts and penchant for blunt honesty that seem to please voters. He has also won points for working smoothly with Annalena Baerbock, the foreign minister, whose choice as the Greens’ candidate for chancellor in last year’s election was tough on Mr Habeck, by his own admission. But the easygoing manner disguises a sharp statesman. Visiting Ukraine last summer, Mr Habeck suggested supplying the country with defensive weapons. Rivals from left, right and centre called him irresponsible. Who looks silly now?
