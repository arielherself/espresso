<strong>Russia</strong> said it would suspend America’s inspections of its <strong>nuclear weapons</strong> under the New START treaty, and blamed Western sanctions for making the process too difficult. The treaty is the only remaining [nuclear-arms agreement](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/31/will-the-ukraine-war-ring-the-knell-for-nuclear-arms-control) between America and Russia. It limits the number of [nuclear weapons](http://west-and-russia-to-nuclear-war) they can deploy, and allows each country to inspect the other’s arsenal. The treaty is set to expire in 2026, though President Joe Biden suggested last week that his administration wanted to negotiate a replacement.

<strong>Israel </strong>reopened border crossings into the <strong>Gaza Strip</strong> on Monday, during an Egypt-brokered truce between Israel and Palestinian militants that came into effect on Sunday and appears to be holding. Fuel trucks were able to move into Gaza, relieving a severe power shortage. [Israeli air strikes on the enclave](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/07/the-attack-on-gaza-may-bolster-israels-prime-minister) have killed 44 people, including two leaders of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militant group.

<strong>China</strong> announced new military drills around <strong>Taiwan</strong> on Monday, despite its previous statement that live-fire exercises would conclude on Sunday. China also announced fresh drills, to last until August 15th, in the Yellow Sea, which separates it from the Korean peninsula. The People’s Liberation Army had already conducted its largest-ever [co-ordinated exercises](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/08/04/china-sends-missiles-flying-over-taiwan) in the Taiwan Strait, in reaction to a visit from an American delegation. Su Tseng-chang, Taiwan’s prime minister, said his island would “never bow to pressure”.

<strong>Ukrainian</strong> staff at the <strong>Zaporizhzhia</strong> [nuclear power plant](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/03/04/europes-largest-nuclear-plant-shuts-down-after-a-russian-attack) are “working under the barrels of Russian guns”, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN’s nuclear watchdog said on Monday. He called for an international mission to the nuclear plant, which was damaged by Russian shelling on the weekend, according to Ukrainian authorities. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has accused Russia of engaging in “nuclear terror” and called for international sanctions on Russia’s nuclear sector.

Travis McMichael, one of three white men [charged with murdering](https://www.economist.com/united-states/the-killers-of-ahmaud-arbery-are-found-guilty/21806458) <strong>Ahmaud Arbery</strong> in 2020, received a life sentence on hate-crime charges, in addition to his existing life sentence for murder. The two other killers, Mr McMichael’s father and a neighbour of the McMichaels, will receive their sentencing decisions later on Monday. Arbery, a black man, was chased and shot while jogging through a mostly-white neighbourhood in Georgia, in an attack described by many as a “modern-day lynching”.

America’s Federal Aviation Administration said <strong>Boeing</strong> could soon resume shipments of its 787 Dreamliner jets, nearly two years after deliveries were first halted because of manufacturing flaws. The announcement is welcome news for the firm following a few [bumpy years](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/01/27/can-boeing-fly-without-government-help)—owing to the grounding of its [737 MAX planes](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/11/27/a-new-book-explains-the-tragic-failure-of-boeings-737-max) after two fatal crashes, and disruptions to air travel during the pandemic.

<strong>Novavax</strong>, an American vaccine-maker, cut its annual revenue forecast by half on Monday, to $2bn-2.3bn, because of weak demand for its <strong>covid-19</strong> jab. [Novavax’s vaccine](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/02/09/how-do-different-vaccines-work), which triggers an immune response by injecting protein fragments similar to the virus that causes covid-19, was authorised for adults by America’s Food and Drug Administration in July. But it has not been approved for children or teens, many of whom remain unvaccinated in America.

## America’s new tone on Africa

When Antony Blinken begins a three-country tour of Africa on Monday, America’s secretary of state will strike a more emollient tone than his predecessors. The Trump administration was obsessed with telling African states to resist China’s supposedly nefarious ways. African leaders saw that as patronising and impractical. [China is Africa’s largest trading partner](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2022/05/20/how-chinese-firms-have-changed-africa) and bilateral creditor. 

Mr Blinken will [recast](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2022/05/20/countering-china-in-africa) America’s approach, saying that African countries have the right to follow their own paths to development. But he will also argue, in a nod to the roughly half of African countries that did not vote at the UN to [condemn](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/04/04/who-are-russias-supporters) Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, that America is the most reliable partner for those journeys, whether they involve dealing with [debt crises](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/04/30/debt-repayment-costs-are-rising-fast-for-many-african-countries) or climate change. African leaders will appreciate this more nuanced message—but wonder where the beef is. Many African economies are in deep trouble and need support for debt relief, generous IMF programmes and money from climate-finance schemes. Mr Blinken’s words are one thing; America’s deeds, quite another.

## Hard times ahead for SoftBank

SoftBank Group reported a loss of 3.2trn yen ($23.4bn) in the second quarter. The unprecedented result adds more misery to what is already an annus horribilis for the Japanese investment giant. After an eventually[ profitable pandemic](https://www.economist.com/business/2020/10/15/what-softbanks-masa-does-next), the firm suffered what was then its[ largest-ever losses](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/05/16/after-a-bruising-year-softbank-braces-for-more-pain) in the first quarter of 2022. These ones are worse.

Most of the newly announced pain comes from SoftBank’s so-called Vision Funds, which make up 38% of its holdings. The funds—which hold both publicly listed tech firms and smaller private companies aiming for rapid growth—posted a loss of 2.3trn yen in the second quarter. Tech stocks have stumbled in recent months as interest rates have risen, causing nosebleed-level valuations to dive. The NASDAQ 100, an index of the best-performing tech companies, lost 22% in the quarter to the end of June, its worst showing since the financial crisis of 2008. 

## America’s abortion wars rage on

Legal challenges to abortion restrictions in America will continue on Monday, when a court in Georgia hears a motion to temporarily halt the state’s ban on abortions after six weeks. In July the American Civil Liberties Union and local pro-choice groups sued the state after a federal court upheld the ban. The plaintiffs argue abortion is protected by a right to privacy in Georgia’s constitution.

Since June, when the Supreme Court [overturned <em>Roe v Wade</em>](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/24/the-supreme-court-erases-the-constitutional-right-to-abortion) and handed abortion policy back to individual states, 14 of them have, in effect, banned the procedure. Several others have imposed severe restrictions. Since then, legal challenges to abortion laws have arisen in at least a dozen states. The federal Justice department has sued Idaho, arguing that under its new rules pregnant women may be denied necessary medical care. But last week Kansans voted overwhelmingly [to keep](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/03/kansans-vote-to-keep-the-right-to-abortion) their right to abortion. With the issue further dividing America ahead of the mid-term elections in November, the battle is far from over.

## BioNTech struggles

Since listing in 2019 BioNTech has rapidly become one of Europe’s biggest biotech companies. With assets worth €19bn ($19.4bn), the German firm is catching up with the pharmaceutical giants. But the company has been hit by an industry-wide downturn: on Monday, its shares plunged as its second-quarter earnings missed expectations.

It is a fall from grace for the company buoyed by sales of the [highly effective](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/07/13/which-covid-19-vaccine-saved-the-most-lives-in-2021) [mRNA](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/03/27/covid-19-vaccines-have-alerted-the-world-to-the-power-of-rna-therapies) coronavirus vaccine it developed with Pfizer in 2020. The company hopes sales of two new vaccines, targeting the Omicron variant, will receive regulatory approval later this year, which should lead to a boost in revenue and keep full-year revenue in line with its predictions.

Biotech firms are battling a funding drought, falling valuations and dwindling reserves of capital. But BioNTech’s vaccine profits had provided it the freedom to invest in ambitious experiments. The company hopes to use mRNA technology to transform the treatment of cancer. But its latest struggles may make investors wary of its aims to tackle the crowded, agonisingly slow oncology market.

## The failings of hazing

The rites of initiation practised by [American university fraternities](https://www.economist.com/united-states/1997/10/02/raise-a-fond-last-glass-to-dionysus) have long been a source of intrigue for anthropologists. Their pet theory is that these “hazing” traditions, which usually involve humiliating or physically tormenting inductees, help build group solidarity. But studying them is difficult, given that they tend to be shrouded in secrecy. Now <em>Evolution and Human Behavior</em>, a journal, has published one of the most in-depth studies on hazing to date. 

Between 2012 and 2014 the study tracked six groups of inductees, known as “pledges”, who were hoping to enter a fraternity chapter (which remained anonymous). The researchers interviewed individuals as they undertook a ten-week induction process, including unnamed hazing rituals. The results suggested that anthropologists were wrong: hazing does not, in fact, improve group solidarity. In recent years concerns about the [dangerous](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2017/10/13/hazing-deaths-on-american-college-campuses-remain-far-too-common) practice have compelled universities to crack down on fraternities. If its ineffectiveness had been proven sooner, hazing would have been exposed for what it is—a cruel, pointless and often dangerous practice.
