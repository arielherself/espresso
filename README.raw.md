The House committee [investigating the Capitol riot](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/29/donald-trumps-shameful-role-in-the-storming-of-the-capitol) of <strong>January 6th 2021</strong> recommended that the Justice Department charge <strong>Donald Trump</strong> with four federal crimes. They are obstruction of justice, conspiracy to defraud the United States, aid to an insurrection and making false statements to the government. The referrals carry no legal weight; prosecutors are conducting their own probe of the former president’s [efforts to overturn the 2020 election](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/21/the-january-6th-committee-has-hobbled-donald-trump). 

<strong>EU </strong>energy ministers agreed to a <strong>cap on gas prices</strong>. Gas may not be bought or sold for more than €180 ($191) per MWh if contracts exceed that price for three consecutive days, which is far lower than the European Commission’s earlier proposal to [cap prices](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/09/27/the-wrong-way-to-solve-europes-energy-crisis) when they hit €275 per MWh for ten days. The cap, which still needs to be legally approved, is due to come into force next February.

<strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>, Russia’s president, said his country would conduct [joint naval drills](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/03/12/xi-jinping-places-a-bet-on-russia) with <strong>China</strong> in the East China Sea starting on Wednesday. For the first time in three years Mr Putin travelled to <strong>Belarus</strong> to meet Alexander Lukashenko, his thuggish counterpart there. Joint army exercises by the two countries have sparked concern that Russia is pressuring Belarus to enter the war in Ukraine.

<strong>COP15</strong>, the UN’s [biodiversity summit](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/12/09/why-is-there-another-cop-happening), concluded with a historic deal to protect 30% of the planet’s ecosystems by 2030 and raise up to $30bn in annual conservation aid for developing countries. The chair of the summit, Huang Runqiu, China’s environment minister, overruled an objection from the Democratic Republic of Congo, which wanted more support for developing countries, to push through the deal.

<strong>Epic Games</strong> agreed to pay $520m to settle allegations by America’s Federal Trade Commission that it violated children’s privacy and tricked players of “Fortnite”, its signature video game, into making unwanted purchases. Separately, the European Commission warned that <strong>Meta</strong> is [breaking EU antitrust law](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/01/is-the-eu-overreaching-with-new-digital-regulations) by giving Facebook users automatic access to its classified-advertising service, Facebook Marketplace, to the disadvantage of competing services. It promised to investigate further.

The High Court in London ruled that plans by <strong>Britain’s government</strong> to [deport asylum seekers](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/11/02/why-small-boats-are-a-big-problem-for-britain) to <strong>Rwanda</strong> are legal. The court also decided that eight people set to be deported to the African country must have their cases reviewed. In June an intervention by the European Court of Human Rights stopped a British deportation flight to Rwanda minutes before departure.

<strong>Binance</strong>, the world’s largest <strong>cryptocurrency</strong> exchange, purchased the assets of Voyager Digital, a bankrupt cryptocurrency lender, for $1bn. Confidence in crypto is at a low ebb following the [implosion of FTX](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/11/17/the-failure-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried-will-leave-deep-scars), a Bahamas-based crypto exchange. Undeterred, however, Binance is still expanding. The company also bought Tokocrypto, an Indonesian crypto exchange.

## 2022 in review: war returns to Europe

<em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, the war in Ukraine.</em>

When Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine at dawn on February 24th, most Western officials thought Kyiv, the capital, would be overrun in days. In fact, Russia’s army was forced to retreat from the north of Ukraine after little over a month. It turned instead to the eastern Donbas region, which over the summer saw the most intense artillery duels since the second world war. By early July Russia had conquered almost all of Luhansk province, but ran out of steam in next-door Donetsk.

The next month Ukraine, armed with American and European artillery and fresh supplies of ammunition, went on the offensive in Kherson province. Ukraine’s army liberated Kharkiv province in September and Kherson city in November, forcing Russia to conduct a partial mobilisation and turn to aerial bombardment of Ukraine’s [power grid](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/12/14/despite-power-cuts-and-blockades-ukraines-economy-is-coping). Both sides are [now rearming](https://www.economist.com/ukraines-fateful-winter) for large battles early next year.

## 2022 in review: the year economic woes kept piling up

<em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, the war in Ukraine.</em>

Before the war in Ukraine began, the global economy was suffering from the after-effects of covid-19. A boom triggered by the West’s lifting of pandemic restrictions had started to fade. At the same time, fiscal-stimulus programmes and supply-chain disruptions caused by the sudden recovery in demand pushed up inflation. China did not begin to reopen until the end of 2022: its zero-covid policy hampered growth both there and elsewhere.

The energy-price jump that followed Russia’s invasion led to another bout of inflation while central banks were still busy fighting the last one. Governments in rich countries spent billions to protect households and businesses from sharply higher prices, pushing up public debt. Higher interest rates in the rich world forced up rates in poorer countries, where the hardship caused by rising food prices is greatest. In 2023, the global economy will struggle to recover.

## 2022 in review: Europe’s biggest refugee movements in decades

<em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, the war in Ukraine.</em>

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused the largest exodus of people in Europe since the second world war. Millions [returned home](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/05/24/as-russias-invasion-stalls-ukraines-refugees-return-home) when it became clear that Russia could not quickly conquer the whole country. But as the war has dragged on into the winter, people continue to trickle out of Ukraine: by December 6th more than 4.8m Ukrainians, almost all of them women and children, had registered for refugee-support schemes in Europe. 

The EU gave all Ukrainians immediate permission to work and receive social benefits. (Syrians have had to spend months or years applying for asylum first.) Many found jobs and settled in quickly, especially in [Poland](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/01/ukrainian-refugees-are-making-poland-multicultural-again), which took in the largest number. But many refugee children are attending online classes given by Ukrainian schools. And generosity has its limits: in March, Poland will start charging refugees for government housing. Meanwhile, Russia claims that 2.9m Ukrainians have come there; many had no other way out of war zones. Thousands of Ukrainian children have been seized and placed with Russian foster parents.

## 2022 in review: the start of a new geopolitical era

<em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, the war in Ukraine.</em>

The war in Ukraine, and the intensifying [Sino-American rivalry](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/10/america-and-china-must-talk), herald a new geopolitical era. Russia shattered the norm that borders should not be changed by force and revived the spectre of nuclear war. America has rallied Western allies to help Ukraine. Even so, it regards China, whose shadow looms ever-larger over Taiwan, as a bigger foe than Russia. China’s growing nuclear stockpile may yet lead to a new arms race and jittery [three-way deterrence](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/29/how-will-america-deal-with-three-way-nuclear-deterrence). 

Economic weapons are being wielded with new ferocity: Russia is starving Europe of fuel; the West is trying to [squeeze Russia’s revenues](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/30/the-wests-proposed-price-cap-on-russian-oil-is-no-magic-weapon) through sanctions and embargoes. America, meanwhile, is working to constrain China’s industries and build up its own, to the ire of many allies. As cleavages deepen between [democracies and autocracies](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/28/how-to-deal-with-despots), much is uncertain—even the name of this post-post-cold-war era. “Great-power competition” is too bloodless; the “new cold war” too reductive. And the “decisive decade”—President Joe Biden’s phrase—won’t stick.
