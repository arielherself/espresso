<strong>Ukrainian</strong> officials said they had discovered a <strong>mass grave</strong> in Izyum, a north-eastern town [recently recaptured](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/15/a-stunning-counter-offensive-by-ukraines-armed-forces) from Russian forces. They claimed that more than 400 bodies had been buried there, including people killed by air strikes. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, accused Russia of leaving “death everywhere”. He promised to share “clear, verified information” on Friday.

India’s prime minister, <strong>Narendra Modi</strong>, publicly criticised Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, telling President <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> that “today’s era is not an era of war”. Mr Putin responded that he understood Mr Modi’s concerns. Meanwhile China’s president, <strong>Xi Jinping</strong>, said that Russia and its Central Asian neighbours should take care to avoid foreign interference or “colour revolutions”. All three leaders are attending the [Shanghai Co-operation Organisation](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/14/what-is-the-shanghai-co-operation-organisation) summit in Uzbekistan.

<strong>Germany</strong> seized control of three refineries belonging to <strong>Rosneft</strong>, Russia’s [state-owned oil giant](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/04/28/why-gerhard-schroder-wont-unfriend-vladimir-putin). The economy ministry said that a federal regulator will take over the operation of the units, which account for around 12% of the country’s oil processing. The move will counter the “impending threat to the security of energy supply” from Russia, argued the ministry.

The <strong>Biden administration</strong> said it would send an additional $600m-worth of <strong>arms to Ukraine</strong>, including more High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems—guided missiles that have [wreaked havoc](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/13/ukraines-new-rockets-are-wreaking-havoc-on-russias-army) on Russia’s army. America has given Ukraine around $15bn in military assistance since the start of the war. Meanwhile, the Kremlin warned that if America supplied Ukraine with longer-range missiles, it would cross a “red line” and become “party to the conflict”.

<strong>British retail sales</strong> dropped significantly, by 1.6%, in August as consumers were hit by sky-high inflation and energy prices, adding to fears of a coming recession. To avert a downturn, Britain’s new chancellor, [Kwasi Kwarteng](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/07/kwasi-kwarteng-is-bold-brainy-and-weird), will introduce an emergency “mini-budget” on September 23rd, likely to focus on tax cuts aimed at stimulating growth.

A judge in <strong>America</strong> upheld a ruling that temporarily bars the Department of Justice from reviewing thousands of documents seized from <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> Florida home. The DoJ had appealed against Judge Aileen Cannon’s original decision, made last week. It must now wait while an independent arbiter—also appointed on Thursday—decides which documents can potentially be used as evidence in its [ongoing criminal investigation](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/09/an-fbi-raid-on-donald-trumps-home-ignites-a-political-firestorm) against the former president. 

A study found that <strong>climate change</strong> played a significant role in the recent devastating flooding in <strong>Pakistan</strong>. World Weather Attribution, a global network of climate modellers, reckons that anthropogenic global warming made rainfall across the country 75% more intense than it might otherwise have been. Almost 1,500 people have died [in the floods](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/09/15/devastating-floods-like-pakistans-will-be-more-common-in-a-warming-world).

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> $30bn, the estimated cost of Pakistan’s floods, equivalent to 9% of GDP. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/09/15/devastating-floods-like-pakistans-will-be-more-common-in-a-warming-world).

## NATO bolsters its eastern front

Military chiefs from 30 NATO countries meet in Tallinn, the Estonian capital, on Friday to discuss the new “strategic concept” agreed at the alliance’s most recent [summit](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/06/26/nato-holds-its-most-important-summit-for-decades) in June. The aim is to shore up the eastern front and make NATO better able to respond to Russia. The alliance has changed since the invasion of Ukraine. Not only is it [expanding](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/06/28/turkey-lifts-its-block-on-letting-sweden-and-finland-join-nato), but military commanders are writing new regional defence plans as to which national forces would defend which geographic areas in the event of a war.

Last week Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary-general, said that the alliance was sending a “message to Moscow about our readiness to…defend every inch of Allied territory.” He also called for member states to send more weapons to Ukraine. Those are still needed. But Ukraine’s stunning [counter-offensive](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/11/is-russia-on-the-run) has left NATO’s number-one adversary looking weakened. A renewed air of confidence may prevail in Tallinn.

## Ramaphosa escapes the ANC to DC

When [Cyril Ramaphosa](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/cyril-ramaphosa-says-the-world-must-end-vaccine-apartheid) visits the White House on Friday he will be glad to put some distance between him and his troubles at home. South Africa’s president, who must win re-election as leader of the ruling African National Congress in December, is under pressure from internal enemies and frustrated voters. In Washington, DC, though, he can expect charm and flattery.

Almost half of African countries, including South Africa, have [declined to condemn Russia’s invasion](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/03/12/why-russia-wins-some-sympathy-in-africa-and-the-middle-east) of Ukraine at the UN. So America has sought to reaffirm its commitment to the continent. Last month Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, set out the Biden administration’s Africa strategy, promising support for development and a more equal, less patronising relationship. This reflects America’s [rivalry with China](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2022-05-28) as much as with Russia. For all its flaws, South Africa remains one of Africa’s most powerful states—and critical to realising America’s policy. Yet White House officials may find that Mr Ramaphosa has no desire to pick sides. Non-alignment suits his country just fine.

## A semblance of normality in Russia’s economy

Immediately after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, its economy appeared to be collapsing. The rouble tanked; regulators had to close the stockmarket. Economists pencilled in a GDP decline of up to 15% in 2022. 

It has [not quite worked out that way](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/23/why-the-russian-economy-keeps-beating-expectations). In one month since the invasion the rouble made up its losses. Since peaking at 17.8% in April, inflation has steadily fallen. That, along with buoyant business activity, has allowed the central bank to ease monetary policy. On Friday it cut interest rates by half a percentage point to 7.5%.

To some degree, Russia has [managed to reorient](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/23/why-the-russian-economy-keeps-beating-expectations) its trading and investment relationships eastwards. The government has also deployed judicious fiscal stimulus, while households and firms have continued to spend and invest. Most importantly, Western sanctions have largely avoided impairing Russia’s exports of oil and gas, the global prices of which have soared. That leaves the central bank free to step on the monetary gas.

## Azerbaijan attacks Armenia, Erdogan meets Putin

The guns have yet to cool in [Armenia and Azerbaijan](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/13/why-azerbaijan-and-armenia-are-fighting-again), where a deadly two-day conflict earlier this week was stopped by a truce on Thursday. Across the Caspian Sea, in Uzbekistan, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, will take up the issue with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the sidelines of a summit on Friday.

Turkey is a firm backer of Azerbaijan. [In 2020](https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/11/12/a-peace-deal-ends-a-bloody-war-over-nagorno-karabakh) Mr Erdogan’s government supplied the country with drones, military advisers and Syrian mercenaries, enabling it to recapture the ethnic-Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. Russia, for its part, has a mutual-defence treaty with Armenia, but also has good relations with Azerbaijan. That allowed it to broker a ceasefire between the pair in 2020.

Bogged down in Ukraine, Russia wants to avoid fresh fighting. Turkey meanwhile is more likely to demand that Armenia recognise Azerbaijan’s sovereignty over Nagorno-Karabakh in exchange for peace. Mr Putin and Mr Erdogan know how to wage proxy wars while maintaining cordial relations. Expect them to agree to disagree in Uzbekistan. 

## David Bowie on screen

[David Bowie’s](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2016/01/16/starman-jones) music often dealt with his inner world, and yet he sported eye-catching costumes to perform for vast crowds. “Moonage Daydream”, Brett Morgen’s new documentary, released on Friday in America and Britain, captures Bowie in his own words, unencumbered by others’ opinions—while imparting an overwhelming sense of just how crowded his life could be.

Music biopics are having a moment, and Bowie holds obvious appeal for ambitious filmmakers. Yet “Moonage Daydream” paints a far more intimate portrait of its subject than do recent films about [Elvis](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/06/24/the-strange-case-of-elvis-presleys-musical-posterity), [Freddie Mercury](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2018/10/26/bohemian-rhapsody-is-more-fantasy-than-real-life) and [Elton John](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/05/20/rocketman-is-a-suitably-ostentatious-biopic-of-elton-john). Mr Morgen has carefully selected archive footage to create a razor-sharp portrait of Bowie. On occasion he overreaches: the film is more interested in Bowie&#x27;s philosophy and art than his relationships and the people around him. At one point Bowie reflects that, “I put myself through everything” to grow into the artist he became. This extraordinary, almost extreme film puts the viewer through a comparable experience.
