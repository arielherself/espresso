<strong>Russia</strong> said it “will not accept” the <strong>price cap </strong>on its oil imposed by the West. On Friday diplomats from the EU, the G7 and Australia agreed to [cap Russian oil ](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/30/the-wests-proposed-price-cap-on-russian-oil-is-no-magic-weapon)at $60 per barrel in an attempt to squeeze Russia’s revenues. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, said Russia had prepared for the cap. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, called the policy “weak”, saying it would not cause “serious” damage to Russia.

<strong>Iran </strong>will abolish its [morality police](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/26/who-are-irans-hated-morality-police), local media reported, a sign that the government may be bowing to ongoing protests. The unrest started in September after Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman, died in custody having been arrested for violating the country’s dress code. On Saturday Iran’s attorney-general, Mohammad Jafar Montazeri, said parliament was reviewing a law requiring women to wear a hijab.

South Africa’s president,<strong> Cyril Ramaphosa</strong>, will not resign, his spokesman said, after an [independent panel](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/01/a-sofa-stuffed-with-cash-imperils-south-africas-president) suggested he [broke](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/06/23/allegations-of-impropriety-weaken-south-africas-president) anti-corruption laws by covering up a theft of some $4m from his game farm. Mr Ramaphosa denied wrongdoing and his spokesperson called the panel’s report “flawed”. MPs will now consider whether to launch impeachment proceedings against the president.

Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang region in north-west <strong>China</strong>, announced a lifting of <strong>covid restrictions</strong> after [unprecedented protests](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/12/01/lessons-from-a-chinese-protest) against the government’s [zero-covid](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/28/chinas-economy-cannot-bear-much-more-zero-covid) policies. The city, where the wave of protests initially began, will reopen malls, restaurants, markets and some other venues from Monday. Other Chinese cities have recently eased restrictions as well in response to the popular unrest.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Honduras </strong>announced it would suspend some constitutional rights as part of a crackdown on criminal gangs. A national-security emergency will be imposed in parts of Tegucigalpa, the capital, and San Pedro Sula, a city in the north. Businesses, NGOs and residents have complained of rising cases of extortion in recent months. In neighbouring <strong>El Salvador</strong> the government deployed 10,000 troops to curb gang violence in a township near the country’s capital.

Kyriakos Mitsotakis, <strong>Greece’s</strong> prime minister, held secret talks with George Osborne, chairman of the British Museum, over a possible return of the <strong>Elgin marbles</strong> to Athens, reported a Greek newspaper. The contested ownership of the frieze—taken by Lord Elgin from the Parthenon in the early 1800s, and later transferred to the <strong>British Museum</strong>—has long been a running sore in [British-Greek](https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/02/20/will-britain-lose-the-elgin-marbles) relations.

<strong>Football World Cup: </strong>After a group stage punctuated by a series of [extraordinary upsets](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/12/02/why-the-world-cups-first-stage-has-been-surprisingly-even), the first two matches of the<strong> knockout round</strong> did not provide any shocks. <strong>Argentina</strong>, inspired by [Lionel Messi](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/08/14/by-the-numbers-lionel-messi-is-european-footballs-best-scorer-ever), beat Australia while<strong> the Netherlands</strong> eased past America. Meanwhile Pelé, who helped Brazil win three World Cups and is now battling cancer, said he was “strong with a lot of hope” following reports that he was beginning end-of-life care.

<strong>Word of the week: </strong><em>fumuguan,</em> a Chinese word meaning “father-mother official” and often used to describe local magistrates in imperial times. [Read for the full story](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/12/01/lessons-from-a-chinese-protest).

## War lessons from Ukraine

Open source intelligence, like YouTube footage of drone strikes and tank battles, has given the public unprecedented insight into war. But it can also mislead. A [new report](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/11/30/what-is-the-war-in-ukraine-teaching-western-armies) by the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank in London, draws on Ukrainian military data to bust some myths. What made the difference in the first weeks of the conflict, for instance, was not Western anti-tank missiles and Turkish drones, feted on social media, but huge volumes of artillery to stop the [Russians north of Kyiv.](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/03/04/why-a-huge-russian-convoy-remains-stalled-north-of-kyiv)

That is a sobering thought for European armies, all of which have less artillery than Ukraine did in February. Drones were important, but 90% of all those that Ukraine deployed between February and July were destroyed. Deception played a vital role. On one occasion Ukraine photographed a destroyed airfield and printed the images onto a large tarpaulin to trick Russian satellites. “This led…amusingly,” the report notes, “to the Russians debating whether Ukrainian fighter aircraft were operating from subterranean shelters.”

## Democrats’ last weeks of power in the House

Nothing clarifies priorities like a tight deadline, and America’s Democrats are staring down two. The first is December 16th, when annual federal funding expires; Congress needs to pass a spending bill or extend the deadline to avoid a government shutdown. The second is January 3rd, when control of the House of Representatives will [flip to Republicans](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/17/in-a-republican-house-investigations-and-fiscal-clashes-loom). Democrats have tried to use their waning days of unified control of Congress to push through some final bills.

They are set to cross one off their list, a law enshrining the protection of same-sex and interracial marriages. Less realistically, they want to ban assault rifles and protect the residency rights of undocumented [immigrants who were brought to America as children](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/24/congress-should-act-now-to-protect-dreamers). Neither is likely to get the necessary 60 votes to overcome a filibuster in the Senate. On Tuesday a run-off election in Georgia may see Democrats add to their slim majority in the upper chamber next year. But with Republicans set to control the House, expect legislative gridlock come January.

## England’s cricket tour of Pakistan

In March 2009 Islamist militants [attacked](https://www.economist.com/asia/2009/03/03/game-over) a bus carrying the Sri Lankan cricket team to play a match in the Pakistani city of Lahore. Eight people were killed. The assault also pushed Pakistani cricket into exile. For the next decade, no international team would visit the country and home matches were shifted to the United Arab Emirates.

Yet cricket in Pakistan has stayed on its feet. The team won two international trophies and a successful Twenty20 franchise league was introduced. And now it is hosting international cricket again. Since Sri Lanka returned in 2019, Australia, Bangladesh, and South Africa have visited. This month England is touring. For cricket-mad Pakistanis living through economic and political turmoil, the three Test matches will be a welcome distraction. They have already been entertained—albeit at their team’s expense. England kicked things off on Thursday by smashing 506 runs, a record for the first day of a Test.

## The Beach Boys: more than just “Good Vibrations”

For most listeners, the Beach Boys’ catalogue both peaks and ends with the album “Pet Sounds” and the single “Good Vibrations”, both masterpieces from 1966. Yet over the following seven years the band would release eight more albums which, although they sold poorly, would form an influential body of work.

A new reissue, “Sail On Sailor: 1972”, collects the final LPs of this sequence, “Carl and the Passions—So Tough” and “Holland”. These records were made in the near-absence of the band’s guiding genius, Brian Wilson, but the rest of the band stepped up in his place. “Holland” in particular is an undervalued marvel. Mr Wilson’s late brothers Dennis and Carl shine creatively, and new members Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar come to the fore on the eponymous “Sail On Sailor”, a classic rock number. The Beach Boys retained their fascination long after their commercial pomp.

## Weekend profile: Alexie, a protester in Shanghai

Alexie has joined two protests in her life. Both times, the Shanghai coffee-shop owner (whose name we have changed) chanted slogans against China’s government—a good way to risk a jail sentence. 

In 2019, to express her own discontent with China’s growing authoritarianism, she travelled to Hong Kong, where she marched with millions of others calling for democratic rule in the territory. She was unable to tell anyone who she was and what she was doing there. “I felt alone, but paradoxically, I had never felt so close to the people around me,” she says.

In the three years since, Chinese officials have only tightened their grip on Hong Kong. Many there have lost hope. Alexie has, too. She considered leaving China on several occasions but ultimately decided against it: not because she didn’t have the means, but because of her “unspeakably deep connections” with her homeland. Alexie is a globetrotter—having lived in Argentina and travelled to nearly all continents, she came back to China four years ago, hoping to establish a stable life, even though it soon started to become “unbearable”, not least because of the prolonged covid-19 lockdowns.

Last Saturday night, she found some solace. She learned from friends that[ protesters were gathering](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/12/01/lessons-from-a-chinese-protest) on Wulumuqi Road, just three kilometres from her apartment. Taking a bouquet of flowers and sheets of white paper, the symbolic weapons of these protests, she joined them. She laid flowers in tribute to the families who had died two days before in a fire in an apartment building in Xinjiang, in far-west China. The building’s exits had reportedly been sealed, to comply with[ China’s zero-covid policy](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/11/27/unrest-breaks-out-across-china-as-frustration-at-lockdowns-grows). The blank paper is more explicitly political, a challenge to China’s strict controls on free expression. 

She could hear the chanting from a few blocks away. “No to PCR testing, yes to freedom.” When one person shouted, “Communist Party!”, a handful of people responded tentatively, “Step down!”. Again, the man shouted “Communist Party!”. This time the response was stronger and more joined in, including Alexie: “Step down!”

The next day, clips of the protest she attended flooded Twitter, which is blocked in China but accessed by people with virtual private networks. With dread she stopped the videos on each frame to check if her face was visible (it wasn’t). “I was afraid, and still am, but I just had to go,” she says.
