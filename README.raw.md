Reports emerged of residents in four Russian-controlled parts of <strong>Ukraine</strong> being coerced into voting in favour of joining <strong>Russia</strong>, after <strong>referendums</strong> [began on Friday](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/23/voting-begins-in-four-sham-referendums-in-ukraine). Ukrainian officials said that people were being intimidated by armed groups, forbidden from leaving certain areas until polls close on Tuesday, or threatened with losing their jobs. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said that the results would be “unequivocally condemned”. The G7 group of rich countries called the referendums a “sham”.

The value of the pound plummeted and markets scrambled after Kwasi Kwarteng, <strong>Britain’s</strong> [new chancellor of the exchequer](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically), announced [huge tax cuts](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/22/liz-trusss-selective-reaganomics-wont-work) and increases in borrowing. The pound fell by more than 3% to its lowest level against the dollar in 37 years. Larry Summers, America’s former treasury secretary, said Britain was acting “like an emerging market turning itself into a submerging market”. 

<strong>America’s</strong> government said it would allow tech firms to operate more freely in <strong>Iran</strong>, to try to help citizens there bypass <strong>internet restrictions</strong>. Many American companies normally do not operate in Iran for fear of violating sanctions. But this week the Iranian government cut off access to most of the internet as part of a crackdown on [widespread protests against religious restrictions on women](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/22/why-iranian-women-are-burning-their-hijabs). 

<strong>China’s</strong> foreign ministry said that <strong>America</strong> was sending “very wrong, dangerous signals” on <strong>Taiwan</strong>, after Antony Blinken, the American secretary of state, met with Wang Yi, the Chinese foreign minister, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. Mr Blinken is said to have stressed the importance of [maintaining peace over the island](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/08/11/how-the-crisis-over-taiwan-will-change-us-china-relations), which China claims as its own. 

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Russia</strong> announced some exemptions from its [civilian draft](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/21/vladimir-putin-declares-a-partial-mobilisation), amid attempts by large numbers of men to leave the country and concerns from companies over staffing shortages. Many of those who work in technology, banking and telecommunications will not be sent to the frontline in Ukraine. Meanwhile Russia’s European neighbours—Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland—collectively ruled out expanding their asylum categories to include fleeing Russians.

<strong>​​Ursula von der Leyen</strong>, the president of the European Commission, said the EU had “tools” to deal with undemocratic governments—a thinly veiled warning to <strong>Italy</strong> ahead of its election on Sunday. A hard-right alliance led by Giorgia Meloni is [expected to win](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/22/how-afraid-should-europe-be-of-giorgia-meloni). Matteo Salvini, the head of one of the parties in Ms Meloni&#x27;s bloc, called the comments “shameful arrogance”.

At least 36 people were killed during storms in 24 hours in Uttar Pradesh, a state in northern <strong>India</strong>, including 12 who were struck by <strong>lightning</strong>. In the past year, across India, there has been a 34% rise in the number of lightning strikes, which are made more likely by climate change increasing the temperature and the amount of moisture in the air. 

<strong>Word of the week: </strong><em>Nannaria swiftae</em>, the scientific name for a millipede given to honour Taylor Swift, the American pop star. [Read the full story.](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/09/21/on-the-troubles-of-naming-species)

## Scholz of Arabia

Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, is visiting three Gulf states this weekend in a bid to shore up energy supplies and dampen prices. With imports of oil and gas from Russia cut off, and power-hungry firms and households facing steep winter bills, Europe’s biggest economy is sliding towards a [recession](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/31/europe-is-heading-for-recession-how-bad-will-it-be). 

Mr Scholz will turn on the charm in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, all big energy exporters, arguing that it is in their own long-term interest to calm markets and keep customers happy. Germany is particularly keen to secure liquefied natural gas deliveries from Qatar, which vies with America and Australia as the top exporter of the fuel. But the toughest meeting on Mr Scholz’s first visit to the region as chancellor may be with [Muhammad bin Salman](https://www.economist.com/1843/2022/07/28/mbs-despot-in-the-desert), the Saudi crown prince. The kingdom’s record on human rights and its messy entanglement in Yemen’s civil war have not endeared the Saudi leader to German public opinion. 

## Political protests in Angola

When supporters of Angola’s main opposition party take to the streets on Saturday they will know that their cause is just—and their chances of success slim. The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) says [last month’s election](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/08/an-unofficial-tally-exposes-angolas-dodgy-election) was rigged by the ruling party—and its former enemy in the country’s civil war—the People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). 

UNITA has a case. Tallies collected by NGOs suggest the result was a near-tie. Yet the electoral commission announced that the MPLA won 51% of the vote. Without a majority, the party’s grip on power would have been at risk. Alas, the courts, the commission and, most importantly, Angola’s security apparatus, are all under its thumb. So UNITA’s protests will probably be defeated, peacefully or otherwise. The only comfort it can take is that, given President João Lourenço’s [disappointing record](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/18/a-dictators-ghost-haunts-angolas-upcoming-elections), the opposition will only grow in strength in Africa’s largest oil producer. 

## “Sidney”, a new look at a Hollywood trailblazer

The rags-to-riches life story of [Sidney Poitier](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/it-was-hard-for-any-viewer-to-look-away-from-sidney-poitier/21807122), as recounted in a new documentary about the trailblazing actor, just released, is as compelling a narrative as any in his films. Sir Sidney’s parents were poor Bahamian tomato farmers. As a teenager, he was taught to read by a Jewish waiter in New York. He went on to become one of Hollywood’s first black leading men (starring in hits like “The Defiant Ones” and “Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner”), the first black winner of an Academy Award for acting (for “Lilies of the Field”), and a director of raucous comedies (such as “Stir Crazy”).

Oprah Winfrey, the documentary’s producer, and other friends speak of him with love and respect. But the highlights of “Sidney” are the archive interviews with the actor himself, who died in January at the age of 94. The towering dignity and authority that made him a superstar can be seen in every clip.

## Juanes, a Colombian rock star, plays in America

Juanes returns to the American stage in San Diego on Saturday to promote his album, “Origen”. The Colombian singer, a winner of three Grammy awards and 26 Latin Grammys, will also release a new album in the coming months.

His songs unite traditional Colombian rhythms with rock instrumentation, giving him rockstar status in his homeland. Born in 1972 and growing up in 1980s Medellín, a city terrorised by Pablo Escobar’s [drug cartel](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/02/08/how-drug-trafficking-is-and-isnt-to-blame-for-violence-in-latin-america) and guerrilla fighters, music provided an emotional escape: “We clung to it as if our lives depended on it,” he recalled. His breakthrough hit was “Fijate Bien”, a song about Colombia’s ubiquitous land mines. In 2008 his “Peace Without Borders” concerts attempted to create cross-border civilian unity amid the diplomatic crisis unfolding between Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela. His career spans a turbulent period of Colombian history—but also a time of change. Last month Colombia’s first ever [left-wing president](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/06/20/how-gustavo-petro-a-former-guerrilla-might-govern-colombia) took office.

## Weekend profile: William Kentridge, South African artist

Using just a stick of charcoal and crisp sheet of white paper, [William Kentridge](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2020/12/09/william-kentridge-contemplates-history-and-creation) tries to make sense of a messy world. Over and over, he traces a line, smudges it a little, rubs it out and traces it anew. His mediums are many, his subjects wide ranging: the Russian revolution; the great colonial wars of the 20th century; the inequities of his native South Africa, first under apartheid and then democratic rule. Doubt, migration and the slipperiness of history are recurring themes.

Aged 67, Mr Kentridge is in the flush of his career—and having a moment. This month “Self-Portrait as a Coffee Pot”, a documentary series chronicling his studio practice, had its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. In London he is involved in three shows. A retrospective at the Royal Academy of Arts, opening on Saturday, is packed to the gunwales with his drawings, sculptures and sets for theatre and opera. Starting on October 6th the Barbican will stage performances, involving music and dance, by South African artists developed at Mr Kentridge’s incubator in Johannesburg. Also next month Goodman Gallery will screen “Oh to Believe in Another World”, a stop-motion film set to Dmitri Shostakovich’s Tenth Symphony.

Shostakovich composed the symphony around the time of Joseph Stalin’s death; its explosive second movement is said to evoke state terror. Mr Kentridge uses marionettes to explore the composer’s attitudes towards Stalin and the Soviet Union. The film resembles a collage. Like much of Mr Kentridge’s work, it implies that history itself is a process of eliding, distorting and stitching things back together.

For the impatient viewer these works may be noisy and confusing. But it’s worth persisting. “One of the hard things to realise”, says Mr Kentridge, “is the edge of who one is, of what your imagination can produce.”
