After only 45 days in office <strong>Liz Truss </strong>resigned, becoming the shortest-serving <strong>prime minister</strong> in British history. She stepped down under pressure from her own Conservative Party MPs following a series of [chaotic political missteps](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/19/welcome-to-britaly), starting with the [disastrous “mini-budget”](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/10/14/liz-truss-has-lost-her-chancellor-signature-tax-cut-and-authority) of September 23rd. She will stay in office while the party holds a leadership election, to be completed by October 28th. <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong>, her rival in the [leadership race](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/07/12/the-conservative-party-after-boris-johnson) earlier this year, is expected to run; some MPs are openly canvassing for the return of her predecessor, <strong>Boris Johnson.</strong>

The <strong>EU </strong>agreed to new sanctions on <strong>Iran</strong> over its supply of [“kamikaze” drones](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/19/will-russias-drone-attacks-change-the-war-in-ukraine) to Russia, which it used to damage Ukrainian energy infrastructure. Volodymyr Zelensky, <strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, said that air strikes had destroyed 30% of the country’s power plants, necessitating limits on electricity usage. Meanwhile Russian-appointed officials in the southern city of [Kherson](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/30/why-does-kherson-matter) said they had evacuated 5,000 civilians, with plans to move up to 60,000 people, amid fears of a Ukrainian counter-offensive.

<strong>Elon Musk</strong> told prospective backers of his bid for <strong>Twitter</strong> that he would sack nearly three-quarters of its 7,500 staff, according to the <em>Washington Post</em>. Mr Musk reportedly said that swingeing job cuts would mark the first step in his [shake-up](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/11/with-or-without-elon-musk-twitter-is-overdue-a-shake-up) of the social-media firm, whose profits lag behind those of its competitors. His [purchase](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/10/11/will-elon-musk-owned-twitter-end-up-as-a-deal-from-hell) is expected to close by October 28th.

<strong>Snap’s </strong>share price fell by more than one-quarter in post-session trading, wiping off over $4bn in market value, after it reported its slowest revenue growth since going public five years ago. The social-media firm warned that revenues in the last three months of 2022 would be flat compared with the same period last year. Snap relies on [digital advertisers](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/28/the-online-ad-industry-is-being-shaken-up), who are retrenching amid a global economic downturn.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Hans Moke Niemann</strong>, the 19-year-old American embroiled in a <strong>chess-cheating scandal</strong>, sued Magnus Carlsen and others in federal court for defamation and colluding to harm his career. Mr Niemann alleges that Mr Carlsen, the reigning world champion, falsely [accused him of cheating](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/10/07/hans-moke-niemann-is-known-to-have-cheated-at-chess-does-he-still) after losing a match, then blacklisted him from top tournaments. He is seeking $100m in damages.

At least 50 people were killed by security forces in <strong>Chad</strong> during a banned anti-government protest in the capital, N’Djamena. The African country descended into chaos after its president of 30 years, Idriss Déby, was [killed](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/04/24/the-death-of-chads-leader-shakes-the-wests-attitude-towards-strongmen) last year and replaced by a transitional military council led by his son. The military pushed back Chad’s democratic transition by two years from its promised deadline on Thursday.

<strong>Philip Morris</strong>, the maker of [Marlboro cigarettes](https://www.economist.com/business/2019/08/29/philip-morris-and-altria-want-to-merge), has raised its offer to buy <strong>Swedish Match</strong> to SKr116 ($10.34) per share from Skr106. Swedish Match produces oral nicotine pouches which are the world’s fastest-growing alternative-nicotine category. PMI, which has pledged to “deliver on a smoke-free future”, is trying to finalise a $15.8bn takeover torpedoed by hedge funds seeking a higher bid.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> $17bn, the estimated amount Ukraine will need to rebuild critical infrastructure and housing for returnees. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/18/ukraines-economy-seems-to-be-growing-again).

## How do you solve a problem like North Korea?

When the top military minds of America, Japan and South Korea meet on Thursday they will mull a problem that they have failed to solve for 30 years: how to defang North Korea’s ever more menacing nuclear programme. The “hermit kingdom” started the year by testing new missile technology. Over the last month it has engaged in [multiple drills](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/02/03/what-is-behind-north-koreas-flurry-of-missile-tests) designed to show it can use its weapons in combat. American and South Korean spooks expect another nuclear test soon, possibly of the sort of “tactical” weapon that could be used on the battlefield.

So far the response has followed a familiar pattern: shows of military strength, talk of America’s and South Korea’s “ironclad” alliance and threats to annihilate North Korea if it steps out of line. Far from giving pause to Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s dictator, this approach merely gives him more time to develop his weapons. A new strategy may be in order. 

## The EU’s packed agenda

European Union leaders will meet on Thursday to discuss the continent’s [energy crisis](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/13/europe-is-growing-complacent-about-its-energy-crisis) and the war in Ukraine. On the agenda will be emergency measures proposed by the European Commission in Brussels that would compel the EU’s 27 governments to jointly purchase some natural gas. That would prevent European countries from bidding against each other, and thus driving up prices. With national governments pushing different remedies to the crisis, diplomats are playing down the chance of sweeping actions such as price caps on gas imports.

That will leave more time to discuss the [situation in Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis). Funds to keep the government in Kyiv ticking over are needed, as is money for future reconstruction. Hawkish states, mainly in central and eastern Europe, are demanding fresh sanctions against Russia in the wake of its drone strikes on Ukrainian cities; the previous package of sanctions was agreed by EU leaders just two weeks ago.

## An ultimatum at a Ukrainian nuclear plant

Thursday marks the deadline by which occupying Russian officials told Ukrainian technicians at the [Zaporizhia nuclear plant](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/19/what-is-at-stake-at-ukraines-zaporizhia-nuclear-plant) that they had to formally switch their allegiance to Russia. Workers who comply will retain their seniority, vacation days and pensions. Those who refuse risk more than the threat of firing. In the months following Russia’s seizure of Europe’s largest nuclear plant, in south-east Ukraine, in March, dozens of employees sympathetic to Ukraine have been tortured, held for ransom or killed. On Monday two more managers were abducted.

The plant’s pre-invasion workforce has shrunk by more than two-thirds. Many Western observers, including the UN’s nuclear watchdog, fear that additional thinning could lead to a nuclear accident. The Ukrainian state operator, Energoatom, has urged staff to keep working but not switch sides. To complicate the workers’ decision, Ukrainian forces are not far off and [advancing well](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/06/ukraine-has-made-stunning-gains-on-the-battlefield). Ukraine’s government has vowed to prosecute those who collaborate with Russia, though officials have suggested that in this case exceptions could be made.

## Turkey keeps its zany economic policies

With inflation surging to 83% and the Turkish lira down by nearly 30% against the dollar since the start of the year, Recep Tayyip Erdogan might have considered reversing [his unusual policy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/25/the-connection-between-russian-sanctions-and-bizarre-turkish-monetary-policy) of lowering interest rates to rein in consumer prices. Not a bit of it. In its third cut in as many months, on Thursday the country’s central bank slashed its benchmark rate by more than expected, from 12% to 10.5%.

And Turkey’s president promises to keep going. “As long as this brother of yours is in power, the interest rate will continue to fall,” he said earlier this month. Mr Erdogan is desperate to sustain economic growth, which reached 7.6% in the three months to June, ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections next year. That means the benchmark rate may soon reach single digits. Inflation be damned.

## The art of dystopian Britain

The Turner prize for contemporary art in Britain is easy to mock. Over the past 40 years its offerings have included a dishevelled slept-in bed, a pickled cow and calf, and a painting made of elephant dung.

Yet, as a barometer of what the nation cares about, the Turner prize often succeeds. An exhibition of the four artists shortlisted for the 2022 prize opened at Tate Liverpool this week. The show includes photographs by Ingrid Pollard, documenting how black people have been portrayed on imagery such as pub signs and street names; delicate sculptures by Veronica Ryan of seed pouches, avocado stones and magnolia pods, all of which were transported as part of the Atlantic slave economy; and a drag-act video by Sin Wai Kin of a non-binary pop band. The final prize, announced on December 7th, may well go to a creepy installation by Heather Phillipson full of animal eyes accusing mankind of [destroying the planet](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/09/01/climate-change-may-lead-to-staggering-levels-of-migration).
