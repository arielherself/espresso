In <strong>Pakistan </strong>a suicide bombing at a mosque killed at least 59 worshippers and injured scores more in Peshawar, close to the Afghanistan border, as they performed afternoon prayers. Up to 400 people were in the building, which was in a fortified security compound that houses the city’s police and counter-terrorism offices. No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing, but the city has previously been terrorised by the [Tehreek-e Taliban Pakistan](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/01/05/pakistan-and-china-find-they-have-little-leverage-with-the-taliban), a militant group.

<strong>Poland </strong>said it will increase defence spending to 4% of GDP this year, up from 2.4% in 2022. That would be the highest proportion among NATO members. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made Poland, its neighbour, [anxious](https://www.economist.com/europe/poland-will-play-an-outsized-role-in-western-efforts-to-assist-ukraine/21808064). Poland recently signed a $1.4bn deal to buy a second batch of [Abrams tanks](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/01/25/what-makes-germanys-leopard-2-tank-the-best-fit-for-ukraine) from America.

<strong>Renault</strong> tentatively agreed to reduce its stake in <strong>Nissan</strong> from 43% to 15%, thus equalising the carmakers’ shareholdings in each other. The French firm’s larger ownership of its Japanese partner had [long](https://www.economist.com/business/2020/05/28/the-renault-nissan-alliance-hunkers-down) been a source of friction in their alliance. In return Nissan will invest in Renault’s electric-vehicle unit. Talks to improve the fractious relationship have been under way for months.

<strong>Jair Bolsonaro</strong> applied for a six-month tourist visa in America, where he has holed up since leaving Brazil’s presidency. He aims to “take some time off” and “clear his head”, said his lawyer. Brazilian authorities are investigating whether he incited the [Brasília riots](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/01/09/supporters-of-jair-bolsonaro-mount-an-insurrection-in-brazil) against his successor on January 8th; earlier some 40 American congressmen urged the Biden administration to revoke his visa.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Germany’s GDP </strong>in the fourth quarter of 2022 was slightly worse than expected, shrinking 0.2% compared with the previous quarter. Despite pressures from high [energy costs](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/11/24/the-costs-and-consequences-of-europes-energy-crisis-are-growing) and rising interest rates, most analysts had expected GDP to be flat. Another contraction, as is predicted for the first quarter of 2023, would mean a [recession](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/why-a-global-recession-is-inevitable-in-2023), which it had previously seemed as though Germany might narrowly avoid.

International Holding Company, the most valuable company listed in Abu Dhabi, promised to buy $400m in shares of the besieged Indian conglomerate the <strong>Adani Group</strong>. Adani Group’s share offering was set off-kilter last week by a scathing report from <strong>Hindenburg Research</strong>, a New York investment firm. [The report](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/27/a-short-seller-rattles-gautam-adanis-empire) accused Adani Group of market manipulation and accounting fraud, sparking a $65bn stockmarket rout.

America’s secretary of state, <strong>Antony Blinken</strong>, encouraged <strong>Palestinians </strong>and <strong>Israelis </strong>to calm tensions amid “a new and horrifying surge in violence” as he landed in Tel Aviv on Monday. A recent spate of killings, including a gun attack on a synagogue in East Jerusalem and a deadly Israeli raid in the West Bank, has prompted fears that conflict could escalate further.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>$25bn, the revenue of the listed companies of the Adani Group in the last financial year. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/27/a-short-seller-rattles-gautam-adanis-empire).

## Israel’s heavy-handed response to shootings

Israel’s [far-right government](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/29/israels-new-government-is-the-most-right-wing-ever) has responded to the worst terror attack against Israeli citizens in 15 years with collective punishment. The family of the Palestinian gunman who murdered seven passers-by in a shooting spree in Jerusalem on Friday night have already had their home sealed, as a prelude to its demolition. Similar steps are planned for the home of the 13-year-old who shot and wounded two Israelis on Saturday. Palestinians in Jerusalem found to be involved in terror activity will have their residency rights revoked.

Legal and moral qualms aside, these tactics have all been tried with only limited success in the past. But the ministers are playing to their nationalist audience. Likewise, with the incendiary decision by Israel’s security cabinet on Sunday to encourage more Israeli civilians to carry guns. Help is unlikely to come from [America’s top diplomat](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/06/16/joe-bidens-middle-east-policy-looks-a-lot-like-his-predecessors), Antony Blinken, when he visits on Monday. The last serious American initiative to solve the conflict ended, fruitlessly, in 2014.

## Germany’s economy braces for a chill

On Monday, when Germany’s statistics office unveiled its final figure for GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2022, the number was slightly worse than expected. The country’s economy shrank by 0.2% compared with the third quarter. That followed a 0.5% rise in GDP between second and third quarters. Another contraction, as is predicted for the first quarter of 2023, would mean a recession, which it had previously seemed as though Germany might narrowly avoid.  
  
 War in Ukraine, lingering supply hiccups and surging inflation, especially in energy prices, has made Germany’s [energy-hungry](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/09/11/germany-faces-a-looming-threat-of-deindustrialisation) and export-reliant economy look especially wobbly. But after a relatively mild weather kept energy prices down, some optimism returned. In fact both production and demand have been hurt by high energy prices and rising interest rates. Now the German government is saying it expects a return to growth in the spring.

## Rahul Gandhi’s long walk back

The de facto leader of India’s opposition party, [Congress](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/10/06/indias-congress-party-seems-determined-to-prove-its-critics-right), finishes his near-3,500km “unite India March” on Monday. Rahul Gandhi has billed his [country-spanning walk](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/01/26/relaunching-rahul-gandhi-again) as a riposte to the strident Hindu-nationalism of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). It is part of an effort to revive Congress’s electoral prospects before a general election next year. The former juggernaut of Indian politics has suffered successive humiliating defeats.

Such pilgrimages, <em>yatras</em>, have long been a feature of Indian politics. Marches in the 1990s were central to the BJP’s rise to prominence. Mr Gandhi has drawn crowds; he is planning more to galvanise local support. That is sorely needed: Congress controls just three of India’s 28 states and less than 10% of seats in the lower house of parliament. Polls say Narendra Modi, the BJP prime minister, is backed by twice as many Indians as Mr Gandhi. Mr Gandhi’s long walk may be over, but Congress still faces a daunting trek.

## The opposition’s vision for Turkey

Turkey’s opposition parties are hopeful about their chances of unseating President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in May, when the country holds both [presidential and parliamentary elections](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/01/16/turkey-faces-a-crucial-election-this-summer). On Monday they will unveil their manifesto, which includes bringing back the country’s old parliamentary system. Executive lawmaking powers were transferred to the president in 2018. Since then Mr Erdogan has [expanded his grip](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/01/19/turkey-could-be-on-the-brink-of-dictatorship) over Turkey’s courts and electoral board. He is also eyeing more constitutional change, to enshrine the right of Muslim women to wear the headscarf and to protect family values against “perverted currents”.

To put a stop to that, the [six opposition parties](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/01/16/the-turkish-opposition-faces-big-obstacles-to-winning-the-election) have formed a coalition which will field a single candidate. But they cannot agree on who that should be. The likely choice—Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the uncharismatic chairman of the CHP, the biggest party in the bloc—has led his party to four successive parliamentary election defeats since 2010. The coalition has two weeks left to squabble until a planned announcement.

## The cost of hurricanes in America

Residents of America’s Gulf coast have several months yet before they batten down the hatches when hurricane season starts in June. But their property-insurance bills offer a constant reminder of the risk of disaster: firms charge homeowners in Florida and Louisiana some of the dearest premiums in the country. Still, insurers are struggling to stay afloat after a run of terrible storms. More than eight went bankrupt in Louisiana last year; 15 have gone under in Florida since 2020.

The result is that states are reluctantly [playing an ever-larger role](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/10/06/floridas-government-subsidises-people-living-in-hurricane-zones) in propping up their insurance markets. On Monday Louisiana lawmakers will gather for a special legislative session and probably allocate money—officials have requested $45m—to induce firms to keep operating. They want to limit homeowners’ reliance on the state-backed insurer of last resort, lest that undermine the private market, while insisting that premiums stay affordable. But what is affordable for homeowners is not economic for firms.
