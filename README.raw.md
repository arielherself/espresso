The <strong>European Union</strong> reached an agreement to voluntarily reduce <strong>natural gas</strong> demand by 15%, in preparation for [Russian cuts](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter) to gas supplies. Exemptions from the reduction target are possible for some member states. The bloc’s decision came a day after [Gazprom](https://www.economist.com/business/how-gazprom-helps-the-kremlin-put-the-squeeze-on-europe/21807841) announced it would further cut gas flows through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Europe, saying the pipeline needs repair work. Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of “gas blackmail”.

<strong>Walmart</strong> pared down its profit forecast for this year, sending shares in American retail firms for a spin. The [beast of Bentonville](https://www.economist.com/business/2017/12/07/the-beast-of-bentonville-battles-amazon-the-king-of-the-e-commerce-jungle) predicted its annual profits will decline by 11-13%, as food and fuel prices force consumers to reduce discretionary spending. Walmart’s shares promptly fell by 10% and Amazon’s fell by 4%. The S&amp;P 500’s Retail Index is down by 24% this year.

<strong>Alibaba </strong>will apply to list in <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, allowing investors from mainland China to buy shares in the Chinese e-commerce giant directly. The firm is already listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but Chinese officials want companies to trade domestically. In January [Hong Kong’s](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/29/the-battle-between-asias-financial-centres-is-heating-up) stock exchange started permitting “innovative” Chinese companies to carry out dual listings. Daniel Zhang, Alibaba’s boss (successor to Jack Ma, a victim of [China’s crackdown ](https://www.economist.com/business/can-chinese-big-tech-learn-to-love-big-brother/21809084)on big tech), said this would help attract a “more diversified investor base”.

A spokesman for <strong>America’s</strong> State Department said that <strong>China</strong> should condemn <strong>Myanmar</strong> after [the junta](https://www.economist.com/economist-reads/2022/06/23/the-seven-books-to-read-about-myanmar) executed four men, two of whom were prominent democracy activists. Ned Price pointed out that China has more influence over Myanmar than any other country, and urged all countries to refuse to sell Myanmar military equipment. China’s foreign ministry said that China did not interfere in other countries’ affairs.

<strong>Taiwan’s </strong>president, Tsai Ing-wen, made a rare visit onboard a naval warship to oversee annual military exercises. Ms Tsai applauded soldiers for their “ability and determination” to defend Taiwan. The week-long drills come amid rising concerns over a possible Chinese invasion. [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/07/21/talk-of-nancy-pelosi-visiting-taiwan-angers-china), Speaker of America’s House of Representatives, plans to visit Taiwan in August, much to the chagrin of China.

<strong>China </strong>attempted to obtain insider information from America’s <strong>Federal Reserve</strong>, according to an investigation by a Senate committee. The investigation identified “a sustained effort by China, over more than a decade, to gain influence over the Federal Reserve and a failure by the Federal Reserve to combat this threat effectively.” The Fed disputed the investigation’s findings, calling it “unfair, unsubstantiated, and unverified”.

<strong>OneWeb</strong> and <strong>Eutelsat</strong>, two satellite companies, announced plans to merge in an attempt to create a European <strong>satellite internet</strong> provider that could rival SpaceX’s Starlink. The deal values OneWeb at $3.4bn; once it closes OneWeb shareholders will own 50% of Eutelsat. OneWeb went bankrupt in 2020 but was bailed out, in part by Britain’s government.

## A darkening outlook for the global economy

An updated forecast for the global economy, released by the IMF on Tuesday, makes for grim reading. The world economy is expected to grow by just 3.2% this year. But the IMF suggests that if [gas flows](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter) to Europe reduce and [inflation](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/26/why-inflation-looks-likely-to-stay-above-the-pre-pandemic-norm) worsens, growth could come in at just 2.9% this year and 2% in 2023. The period from 2020 to 2023 would then register as one of the worst global growth performances of the post-war era.

Economic conditions have worsened steadily since early this year, spoiled by Russia’s war in Ukraine, economic weakness in China and central banks’ struggle to choke off inflation. The IMF last published its World Economic Outlook in April. Back then it revised down its forecast for world GDP growth in 2022 by nearly a full percentage point, to a so-so rate of 3.6%. But in the months since then, inflation has proven harder to contain and the economies of America, China and Europe have all stumbled. There are likely to be more disappointments ahead.

## Keeping Europe warm this winter

At an emergency meeting in Brussels, energy ministers of the 27 EU countries agreed to reduce their gas consumption by 15%, compared with the average for the past five years, from August 1st until the end of March. The hope is to help the bloc weather the winter should Russia [halt or radically reduce gas supplies](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter). Such fears had deepened on Monday when Russia announced that it would further reduce the flow of gas to Europe through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, to 20% of capacity.

The agreement is voluntary, though ministers accepted that should flows fall further, mandatory cuts proposed by the European Commision a few weeks ago could be introduced. It also has allowances for countries less exposed to Russian energy blackmail. Spain and Portugal wondered why they should be punished for the mistakes of countries, such as [Germany](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/14/can-deutschland-ag-cope-with-the-russian-gas-shock), that spent decades making themselves ever-more dependent on Russian gas. Hungary was reportedly the only country of the 27 to oppose the compromise deal

## Indonesia’s surprisingly energetic diplomacy

For Xi Jinping, China’s president, a meeting with Joko Widodo on Tuesday marked something of a return to face-to-face diplomacy after his self-enforced isolation during the pandemic. (He did hold a few meetings with foreign leaders during Beijing’s Winter Olympics in February.) But for Jokowi, as Indonesia’s president is known, it is the latest in a recent flurry of visits.

Jokowi’s diplomacy has an important [economic dimension](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/21/why-indonesia-punches-below-its-weight-in-global-affairs). He has pleaded with Vladimir Putin to unblock exports of Ukrainian wheat, which Indonesia needs for instant noodles. In Beijing, he and Mr Xi agreed to boost trade and work together on agriculture and food security.

Yet Jokowi’s diplomatic skills will be especially tested by Indonesia’s hosting of a summit of G20 leaders in November. Russia is a G20 member, but the West has threatened to boycott the event if Mr Putin shows up. So Jokowi has invited Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, to join too, hoping that might soothe the West.

## Another false start in Stormont

A fresh attempt to form a government in Northern Ireland has been postponed following the death of David Trimble, the unionist co-architect of the Good Friday Agreement. Rivals delayed recalling the devolved assembly as a mark of respect. The third attempt to restore power-sharing since May almost certainly would have failed.

In February the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party brought down the administration in protest at the [Northern Ireland protocol](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/03/10/why-is-the-northern-ireland-protocol-so-contentious), a contentious part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement that establishes [a trading border](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/06/16/the-northern-ireland-protocol-enrages-some-businesses-pleases-others) between Great Britain and Northern Ireland to avoid hardening the land border on the island of Ireland. The DUP went on [to lose](https://www.economist.com/britain/sinn-fein-has-become-northern-irelands-biggest-party/21809215) an election in May to Sinn Fein, its nationalist rival. But since then the DUP has repeatedly vetoed the formation of a new government.

The DUP hopes that Liz Truss, rather than Rishi Sunak, will win the Conservative Party leadership and stick to [a Tory promise](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/05/18/britain-and-the-eu-head-towards-a-showdown-over-the-northern-ireland-protocol) to ditch most of the protocol. Either way, months of stasis loom.

## To the moon and back

In 1969 Buzz Aldrin became the second Earthling to walk on the moon, stepping on to the lunar surface 19 minutes after his fellow American, Neil Armstrong. On Tuesday a sale at Sotheby’s in New York will auction memorabilia collected by Mr Aldrin from the mission. A jacket he wore on Apollo 11 has a guide price of $1m-$2m. So too does a broken circuit-breaker switch which nearly imperilled the mission, offered with the pen that Mr Aldrin used to fix it.  
  
 The sale is timely. A new [moonrush](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/01/01/in-2022-a-moonrush-will-begin-in-earnest) is under way as countries compete to [explore](https://www.economist.com/international/2021/07/17/america-china-and-the-race-to-the-moon) Earth’s closest neighbour. China and Russia are building a joint moonbase. America’s Artemis programme aims to land on the far side of the moon, the first American mission to do so, by 2025. To take more astronauts to the moon, NASA is planning to use a rocket developed by Elon Musk’s [SpaceX](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/02/19/spacexs-monstrous-dirt-cheap-starship-may-transform-space-travel), a company that wants to take billionaire tourists on off-world adventures. The astronomical costs of such trips make the items on offer in Mr Aldrin’s sale look reasonable.
