The first ship carrying <strong>grain exports</strong> set off from the Ukrainian port of Odessa on Monday as part of the [deal negotiated between Russia and Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/21/odessas-port-may-soon-be-reopened). Earlier Russian missile strikes on Mykolaiv, a port city in the south, killed Oleksiy Vadatursky, one of Ukraine’s richest businessmen and biggest exporters of grain. A Ukrainian spokesman said Russia had targeted Mr Vadatursky deliberately.

Manufacturing activity in the euro zone contracted in July, intensifying fears of a <strong>recession</strong>. S&amp;P Global’s Purchasing Managers’ Index dropped to 49.8 in July compared with 52.1 in June. It was the first fall below 50, which indicates contraction, since May 2020. Staff absences due to covid-19 and supply shortages contributed to the downturn.

<strong>Iran’s </strong>atomic energy chief, Mohammad Eslami, said that the country has the ability to build a<strong> nuclear weapon</strong>, but does not plan to do so. His comments will increase anxiety over Iran’s nuclear activities, which have increased since a deal to limit its nuclear programme, agreed in 2015, began to unravel after <strong>America</strong> withdrew its support under the presidency of Donald Trump.

<strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong>, the speaker of America’s House of Representatives, landed in Singapore, the first stop of a tour through Asia. Her delegation also plans to visit Malaysia, South Korea and Japan. There was no mention of whether she would travel to Taiwan as initially suggested. Chinese officials earlier [threatened](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/07/21/talk-of-nancy-pelosi-visiting-taiwan-angers-china) “strong and resolute measures” should she stop on the island. If she does, Ms Pelosi would be the highest-ranking American official to visit Taiwan since 1997.

<strong>Retail sales</strong> in <strong>Germany</strong> saw their biggest year-on-year slump since 1994, new data showed on Monday. Sales in June fell 8.8% in real terms compared to the same month last year, larger than the 8% drop predicted by analysts. High inflation, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the covid-19 pandemic have all helped to deter shoppers. 

<strong>Myanmar’s</strong> military junta extended a <strong>state of emergency</strong> across the country by six months. The regime has ruled with emergency powers since overthrowing the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. Last week it reintroduced the death penalty and [executed](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/myanmar-extends-state-of-emergency-for-six-months-until-february) four activists. Generals promise new elections will be held next year, though few think that likely.

<strong>England’s women footballers</strong> became European champions, defeating Germany in a tense final in London. It was England’s first victory in a [major football tournament](https://www.economist.com/international/2022/07/21/the-womens-euros-are-selling-out-stadiums) since the men’s team won the World Cup in 1966. Some 17.4m Britons watched the Lionesses’ final victory, a striking figure for a country obsessed with the men’s game.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>10%, the proportion of the Russian population that has experienced torture by law-enforcement agencies. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/07/28/vladimir-putin-is-in-thrall-to-a-distinctive-brand-of-russian-fascism).

## A nuclear free-for-all looms

The fabric of nuclear-arms control, woven after the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, has long been fraying. The [war in Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/06/02/a-new-nuclear-era) may rip it entirely, as [Russia](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/07/28/vladimir-putin-is-in-thrall-to-a-distinctive-brand-of-russian-fascism) threatens to use nukes. A chance to patch it up comes on Monday, with the opening in New York of a month-long conference of 191 signatories of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

The agenda is forbidding: Iran is on the nuclear threshold; North Korea has crossed it; Britain is enlarging its arsenal; and China is building up fast. The global stockpile of 12,700 warheads is thus set to grow. Splits between big powers, and between nuclear haves and have-nots, may prevent agreement. Many have signed an alternative treaty to ban nukes altogether.

The good news? America and Russia still swap information about long-range weapons under New START. The bad? The treaty expires in 2026. Follow-on talks stopped after the invasion of Ukraine. There is no sign of them resuming soon—if ever.

## Less gas requires more solidarity

It is rare for industrial assets to be expropriated in Europe these days. But because it has done nothing to fill it up, Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, will on Monday lose its part of the Haidach natural-gas storage facility in Austria, one of the largest in central Europe. Another operator will take over the space. Yet the change in ownership will not do much to solve the [continent’s gas squeeze](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/28/the-eu-agrees-on-an-energy-diet-to-fight-russian-gas-cuts). It may run out of gas next spring.

If Gazprom keeps supply at just 20% of capacity through Nord Stream 1, the biggest pipeline providing Russian gas, it is unlikely that storage facilities across the European Union, currently 67% full, will reach the EU’s goal of 80%. If the firm reduces the flow even further or the winter is unusually cold (or both), facilities in some countries, particularly Germany, could run empty by March or so. Then the big question will be whether EU member states will show solidarity and share [whatever gas they have left](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter).

## Britain takes aim at dirty money

Any government serious about tackling [money-laundering](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2022/07/11/the-best-books-to-read-to-understand-financial-crime) needs to crack open anonymous shell companies. These can shield those using dirty dosh to buy assets, often swanky pads in places like London and Paris. On Monday [Britain](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/05/07/how-to-solve-britains-dirty-money-problem) will take a step in the right direction. A register of the “beneficial” (real) owners of overseas companies that hold British property will come into force. The idea is to force more transparency on those hiding behind brass-plate firms in tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands.

The move comes six years after Britain introduced a public register of owners of domestic companies. This was seen at the time as a global landmark in the fight against financial crime. But the lessons from it are sobering. Policing has been weak, with few prosecutions for submitting false data. The omens this time are not good, either. Despite feisty political rhetoric, British law enforcement lacks the funding needed to get a grip on the money-rinsers.

## Publishers’ antitrust battle

The proposed $2.1bn merger of Penguin Random House and Simon &amp; Schuster may reduce the North American book industry’s Big Five to just four. But first it has to get past the American Department of Justice’s [antitrust division,](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2022/01/10/the-growing-demand-for-more-vigorous-antitrust-action) which will argue in a trial beginning on Monday that the two publishers should be kept separate.

America’s antitrust enforcers normally keep firms apart over concerns that their market power would reduce supply and raise prices for consumers. But rather than base its case on arguments about fewer and more expensive books, the department will argue that the combined company would have too much power over authors’ pay, leading to less fierce bidding wars for writers’ works. The DoJ’s tactic is rare but not unprecedented. If it is successful, more cases focused on big firms’ power over wages could be on the way. 

## Wearable stickers to peer inside the body

Ultrasound captures images from inside the body in real time with high-frequency sound waves. Useful as it is, clunky equipment and clammy gel make it a cumbersome affair. It also requires the steady hand of a highly skilled sonographer. But now, as published in <em>Science</em>, researchers have invented a bioadhesive sticker that attaches to the skin. The size of a postage stamp, the stickers can take images of organs, tumours or embryos continuously for 48 hours.

In tests, the stickers provided high-resolution live images of volunteers’ insides. That could mean sonographers may no longer need to be present throughout surgeries, monitoring blood flow. But the real breakthrough would come if the stickers could be made wireless; people could buy them at the pharmacy and slap them on like plasters. Patients’ smartphones would do the rest—analysing the data and alerting them or their doctor. As easy to use as nicotine patches—only better for your health.
