Millions of Americans began voting on <strong>midterms</strong> election day, which will see hundreds of races for the Senate and House of Representatives decided, with most results to be announced on Tuesday night. Like it was 2020 once again, <strong>Joe Biden</strong> and <strong>Donald Trump</strong> took to the hustings hours before [the midterms’](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/05/what-to-watch-ahead-of-the-midterms) finale to blast one another’s parties. Mr Biden warned voters that a Republican victory (more or less [expected](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/11/04/our-midterm-predictions-point-to-major-gains-for-the-republicans)) will weaken the country’s [democratic institutions](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/10/27/why-the-republicans-anti-democracy-turn-has-become-normalised). Mr Trump promised to make a big announcement on November 15th, presumably that he will stand again in 2024. 

A group of experts established by the UN told delegates at <strong>COP27</strong> that there must be stricter rules to stop companies being dishonest about their climate action. António Guterres, the UN’s secretary-general, criticised the “rank deception” of fossil-fuel companies which have promised to slash their <strong>emissions</strong> yet use loopholes such as carbon offsetting to continue to invest in new production of oil, coal and gas.

<strong>Binance</strong>, a <strong>cryptocurrency</strong> exchange, is set to buy FTX, a competitor run by billionaire [Sam Bankman-Fried](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/07/05/cryptos-last-man-standing), after the company faced financial difficulties and a liquidity crunch. [Changpeng Zhao](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2021/12/18/the-most-powerful-people-in-crypto), Binance’s chief executive, tweeted that FTX had asked for his firm’s help in a difficult period. FTX’s FTT token dropped 30% earlier on Tuesday; Bitcoin and Ethereum also slumped earlier on news of the company’s struggles.

Protesters supporting <strong>Imran Khan</strong>, the former prime minister of <strong>Pakistan</strong>, blocked motorways around Islamabad, the capital, as part of an attempt to overthrow the government. On Thursday Mr Khan was shot in the leg in a [failed assassination attempt](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/11/03/imran-khan-pakistans-ex-prime-minister-survives-an-attempt-on-his-life); he alleges that Shehbaz Sharif, the prime minister, and civilian and military officials conspired to kill him. Pakistan’s police have launched an investigation into the attack.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights wants the immediate release of <strong>Alaa Abd el-Fattah</strong>, a [jailed British-Egyptian activist](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/06/22/the-tragedy-of-alaa-abd-el-fattah-a-relentless-revolutionary), a spokesperson said on Tuesday. Mr Abd el-Fattah began a hunger strike in April and stopped taking water when <strong>COP27</strong> began on Sunday. His family have begged Rishi Sunak, Britain’s prime minister, to obtain proof that Mr Abd el-Fattah is alive.

<strong>America </strong>confirmed reports about its channels of communication with <strong>Russia</strong>; they remain open. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, said that whereas it is in America’s interests to maintain contact with the Kremlin, he was “clear-eyed about who we are dealing with”. It had been reported that he held talks with Nikolai Patrushev, his Russian counterpart, specifically regarding [nuclear escalation in Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/international/2022/09/29/could-the-war-in-ukraine-go-nuclear).

<strong>Nvidia</strong>, America’s most valuable semiconductor company, is now selling an alternative graphics-processing <strong>chip</strong> in China that meets the Biden administration’s new restrictions on chip exports. America’s government has blocked the sale of cutting-edge chips to China in order to slow its rival’s military progress. [Nvidia’s](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/09/01/is-nvidia-underestimating-the-chip-crunch) new A800 chip is less effective than its predecessor, the A100, at training large AI models.

## America’s midterm election day

On Tuesday Americans go to the polls—or, to be more precise, finish going to the polls. More than 40m voters have cast early ballots in the midterms, pointing to the continuation of a trend of record-high turnout in American elections. After see-sawing for months, most pundits now predict a good night for Republicans. They are expected to win a majority in the House and are [favoured to do so in the Senate](https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-midterms-2022/forecast/senate). 

Though Democrats are buoyed by support for abortion rights, they are burdened by inflation, crime, an unpopular president and a historical pattern that the party holding the White House loses ground in midterms. But a more important historical pattern seems likely to be violated: many Republican candidates have refused to commit to honouring the results should they lose, following the example of Donald Trump in 2020. A political cliché—that “the only poll that matters” is on election day—may be put to the test.

## India and Russia’s mutual admiration

Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India’s foreign minister, met Sergey Lavrov, his Russian counterpart, in Moscow on Tuesday. The atmosphere was cordial. Trade between two countries has soared and is set to exceed $30bn next year, two years before the target set for it to do so. India is now one of the main buyers of Russian oil, which is [under sanctions from the West](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/03/the-g7-plans-to-cap-russian-oil-prices). It is also one of the best customers for Russian weapons.

In September, [after months of silence](https://www.economist.com/asia/why-wont-indias-government-condemn-vladimir-putin/21808074), Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, commented on President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “This is not an era of war,” he said, adding that “democracy, diplomacy and dialogue” were needed instead. But despite suggesting it is “deeply disturbed” by the warmaking, India has repeatedly refused to vote on any United Nations’ resolution condemning it. In return Mr Putin has praised Mr Modi as a “great patriot” and lauded his ability “to pursue independent foreign policy”.

## Blockbuster meme stocks have a difficult next act

AMC, the world’s largest cinema chain, will report its quarterly results on Tuesday. In 2020, lockdowns shutting cinemas tanked the company’s revenues by nearly 80%, bringing it close to bankruptcy. In 2021, its fortunes shifted with the[ meme-stock frenzy](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/07/06/are-meme-stocks-harmless-fun-or-a-threat-to-the-financial-old-guard), as retail investors stampeded into the market to squeeze professional short-sellers targeting beloved companies. Between January and June 2021, its share price rose from just above $2 to $61, a rally egged on by Adam Aron, AMC’s iconoclastic boss, on social media.

The hype is now fizzling out. Shares are trading below $6. Revenue has been recovering, but analysts expect it to remain below 2019 levels this year and next as cinema attendance remains depressed (viewers can now often watch new films at home). AMC’s problems will be further exacerbated by a lack of blockbuster releases between now and Christmas. Investors spooked by the collapse of Cineworld, a rival company, in September are now eyeing AMC with more concern.

## Financial fault lines at COP27

On Tuesday Gaston Browne, the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, addressed COP27, the annual United Nations climate summit in Egypt. Speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States—a group of countries that has the most to lose from rising temperatures and sea levels—Mr Browne called for a global carbon tax on oil and gas companies, used to help countries like his offset [the damages they have already incurred](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/03/what-is-climate-loss-and-damage) from climate change.

A report, commissioned by Britain and Egypt and released on Tuesday, states that poor countries will need $2trn per year by 2030 for adaptation and to reduce their emissions, half of which will have to come from external financing. The private sector will provide much of that investment, but the report also argues that rich countries should double the climate grants and low-interest loans they provide to $60bn by 2025. Arguments over money are at the heart of this year’s conference. Rich countries have still not met their target of providing $100bn in [climate finance](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2022/11/01/public-money-must-pave-the-way-for-private-investment-in-climate-change-adaptation) a year by 2020.

## How HBO changed television

Fifty years ago on Tuesday HBO broadcast its first programme—a hockey match. The television network’s early offering combined live sport with uncensored films. As a paid-for cable channel, it was not subject to the same government restrictions on content as broadcast television, nor did it have to please advertisers.

Capitalising on this freedom, HBO started developing original dramas; creations often revelled in violence, sex and swearing. “It’s not TV. It’s HBO” proclaimed a famous slogan first used in 1996. The network soon became a television trend-setter. Hit gangster-drama “The Sopranos” created a zest for antiheroes, something subsequently copied by AMC (the network, not the cinema company) with shows like “Mad Men” and “Breaking Bad”. “Game of Thrones”—HBO’s most successful drama, which scooped up 59 Emmy awards during its eight-season run—fueled appetite for fantasy. With high production values and demanding narratives, the network changed viewers’ expectations of television and paved the way for [companies like Netflix](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/10/31/what-went-wrong-with-snap-netflix-and-uber). Those streamers are now HBO’s main competition.
