Several news outlets reported that<strong> Volodymyr Zelensky</strong>, [Ukraine’s](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/12/20/our-country-of-the-year-for-2022-can-only-be-ukraine) president, plans to visit <strong>Washington</strong> on Wednesday, to address Congress and meet Joe Biden, his American counterpart. It would mark his first known foreign trip since the war’s start, though it reportedly may be called off owing to security concerns. American lawmakers are preparing to pass a $1.7trn spending bill that contains $45bn in additional assistance to Ukraine and NATO.

On Tuesday Mr Zelensky made a surprise visit to Bakhmut, a tiny town in eastern Ukraine that Russia has been[ attempting to seize](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/12/06/russia-is-hurling-troops-at-the-tiny-ukrainian-town-of-bakhmut) for months. <strong>Vladimir Putin </strong>admitted that the situation in the[ four regions of Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/zaluzhny-transcript) that his country claimed to have annexed in September is “extremely difficult”. Meanwhile, the Kremlin moved to shut down the Moscow Helsinki Group, one of Russia’s most prominent human-rights organisations.

<strong>Wells Fargo</strong> agreed to a $3.7bn settlement with America’s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over mismanagement tied to mortgages and loans. The CFPB ordered America’s [fourth-largest bank](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/10/26/what-kind-of-bank-will-wells-fargo-be) to pay $2bn to redress harm done to customers and fined the bank $1.7bn—a record amount. Wells Fargo has been scandal-stricken since 2016, when it emerged that it had opened fraudulent customer accounts.

<strong>China</strong> said it would limit its official tally of <strong>covid-19 deaths</strong> to those who tested positive for the virus and died from respiratory failure. The definition is narrower than the previous standard, which included anyone who died after testing positive. As the virus spreads throughout the country, just five covid fatalities were reported on Tuesday; the true number is [likely to be](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/12/15/our-model-shows-that-chinas-covid-death-toll-could-be-massive) far higher.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

The <strong>Taliban</strong> barred <strong>women</strong> from attending university in Afghanistan. The edict, issued in a letter by the higher-education minister, adds to the many schooling-related [obstacles](https://www.economist.com/leaders/the-taliban-are-shackling-half-the-afghan-population/21808483) the Taliban have imposed on Afghan women since regaining power in 2021. They in effect banned girls from secondary school after taking over, and in October severely restricted the subjects women could study at university.

<strong>Mexico</strong> granted asylum to family members of <strong>Peru’s</strong> former president, Pedro Castillo, who faces prosecution for his attempt to [dissolve the legislature](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/12/07/after-a-bungled-coup-attempt-perus-president-falls). Mexico did not say which of his relatives or how many had sought refuge at its embassy in Lima. Several, including his wife, are being investigated for corruption. Mexico’s president continues to acknowledge Mr Castillo, a fellow leftist, as Peru’s rightful leader.

<strong>EU regulators </strong>will open an investigation into a planned $61bn takeover of VMware, a software company, by <strong>Broadcom</strong>, a chipmaker. The European Commission said it was concerned that Broadcom could make VMware’s software inoperable with competitors’ hardware. Separately, <strong>Amazon</strong> [reached a settlement](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/01/is-the-eu-overreaching-with-new-digital-regulations) with EU regulators to end an antitrust probe, avoiding a potential fine of 10% of global revenues. 

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>$1.6trn, the potential loss in children’s lifetime earnings caused by pre-school closures during 2020, according to UNICEF.

## 2022 in review: Xi Jinping’s greatest test

<em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, the year in politics.</em>

China’s president, Xi Jinping, had hoped to use the past year to showcase his power. And in October he did: at the Communist Party’s five-yearly congress Mr Xi secured a [norm-breaking third term](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/10/23/xi-jinping-leaves-no-doubt-who-is-in-charge-of-china) as party boss. His reshuffle of the top decision-making body, the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, [elevated loyalists](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/27/for-xi-jinping-loyalty-trumps-ability). Gone were any checks on Mr Xi’s dirigiste economic instincts or authoritarian urges.

But what followed in November—when anti-lockdown protests erupted around the country—served as a [rebuke of Mr Xi](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/12/01/chinas-failing-covid-strategy-leaves-xi-jinping-with-no-good-options). For months official media had hailed him as commander-in-chief of a people’s war against covid-19. “Zero-covid” was his trademark policy. Yet it proved unsustainable in the face of the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Amid public anger at draconian restrictions and a suffering economy, the government largely ditched its zero-covid policy. Now people are expected to fend for themselves. Low vaccination rates could overwhelm hospitals and lead to a [calamitous loss of life](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/12/15/our-model-shows-that-chinas-covid-death-toll-could-be-massive). It is a predicament of Mr Xi’s [own making](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/12/01/xi-jinpings-zero-covid-policy-has-turned-a-health-crisis-into-a-political-one).

## 2022 in review: the Republican wave that wasn’t

<em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, the year in politics.</em>

High inflation, and dissatisfaction with President Joe Biden, ought to have been a gift to Republicans in November’s midterm elections. Yet they barely eked out a majority in the House of Representatives and lost a seat in the Senate. For that they can thank the Supreme Court’s rollback of abortion rights, which energised Democrats, and Donald Trump, whose hand-picked, conspiracy-peddling candidates [repelled moderates](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/10/after-the-midterms-america-and-its-democracy-look-stronger). Indeed, after their [dismal showing](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/10/a-republican-victory-will-be-much-smaller-than-democrats-feared) Republicans have increasingly questioned whether Mr Trump—who faces several [criminal probes](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/05/how-much-legal-jeopardy-is-donald-trump-in)—should be their presidential nominee in 2024. Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor, has [seen his star rise](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/09/the-rise-of-ron-desanctimonious).

In Washington Mr Biden had a busy summer of lawmaking. First came $280bn-worth of subsidies for [semiconductors and scientific research](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/29/america-takes-on-china-with-a-giant-microchips-bill), followed by nearly $400bn for [clean energy](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/09/joe-bidens-signature-legislation-passes-the-senate-at-last). The next two years of his term promise to be much less productive; divided government will cause legislative gridlock.

## 2022 in review: Britain’s year of turmoil

<em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, the year in politics.</em>

Three prime ministers and the death of a beloved monarch: in Britain, turbulence was the year’s watchword. Boris Johnson’s [chaotic premiership](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/07/boris-johnson-should-go-immediately) finally fell apart in July. After wriggling his way out of numerous scandals, he was ultimately undone by his admission that he knew of sexual-misconduct allegations against an MP whom he had nevertheless promoted in government. Next came Liz Truss, whose plan for unfunded tax cuts [backfired spectacularly](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/10/20/who-will-be-britains-next-leader). Her 49 days in office won her the ignoble distinction of being the [shortest-serving](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/20/liz-truss-is-britains-shortest-serving-prime-minister)—and arguably worst—prime minister in British history.

Rishi Sunak entered Downing Street in October, promising personal decency and sound fiscal stewardship. That his ascension brought relief reflects low expectations [rather than Mr Sunak’s own talents](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/10/25/rishi-sunaks-first-job-clearing-up-the-mess-he-helped-make) or lasting unity among Conservative MPs. Indeed, the tension remains unresolved between the Tories’ hankering for low taxes and their habit of making big-state promises. Moreover, stability is not enough to solve the [problems plaguing Britain](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/26/rishi-sunaks-promise-of-stability-is-a-low-bar-for-britain): low growth, a rocky post-Brexit future and an acute inflation crisis.

## 2022 in review: Brazil’s white-knuckle election

<em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, the year in politics.</em>

It was closer than polls had suggested; indeed, the narrowest presidential election since Brazil’s return to democracy in the 1980s. On October 30th Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a leftist former president, [claimed victory](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/11/03/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-will-oversee-a-more-divided-brazil) over the far-right populist incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, by 1.8 percentage points—just 2.1m votes. In a campaign marked by mudslinging, both candidates were tainted: Mr Bolsonaro by his mismanagement of the pandemic, and Lula by an old corruption scandal known as Lava Jato (Car Wash). (Lula was convicted of corruption and served a year and a half in jail before the convictions were annulled.)

Three weeks later Mr Bolsonaro [challenged the results](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/11/23/jair-bolsonaros-challenge-to-brazils-election-was-rejected) in court, without success. Fears that he may try to block the transfer of power in January, when Lula takes office, have been allayed. But Lula will struggle to govern a country that is deeply divided. Many <em>bolsonaristas</em> no longer trust institutions such as the Supreme Court and what they call the mainstream media. Lula will have his work cut out for him.
