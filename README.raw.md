The <strong>UN’s</strong> human-rights chief urged <strong>Elon Musk</strong> to ensure that “human rights are central to the management of Twitter”. Reports that the social-media firm’s entire human-rights team had been sacked were not an “encouraging start”, wrote Volker Turk in an open letter. Earlier Mr Musk claimed Twitter had “no choice” but to conduct mass layoffs as the social media platform is [losing $4m per day](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/11/03/will-people-pay-8-a-month-for-twitter).

Vladimir Putin<strong>, Russia’s</strong> president, said any remaining civilians in <strong>Kherson </strong>in southern Ukraine should leave, his first public acknowledgement that Ukrainian forces are drawing close to the [occupied city](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/30/why-does-kherson-matter). Meanwhile, <strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said that the most intense fighting was [around Bakhmut](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/11/01/keeping-ukraine-from-freezing-this-winter), 500km away, where Russia was “forcing tens or hundreds of thousands more people to the meat grinder”.

<strong>Iran’s</strong> Revolutionary Guards launched a new rocket capable of carrying a satellite, according to state television. The country has three satellites in orbit, and claims its programme is peaceful, though Western powers are not so sure. Separately, for the first time Iran admitted to [supplying Russia with drones](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/19/iranian-drones-pose-a-fiendish-military-problem-for-ukraine)—but said the shipments were delivered before the war in Ukraine. An American official said they were sent this past summer.

<strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>, Warren Buffett’s conglomerate, recorded a loss of $2.7bn in the third quarter of 2022 as stocks sagged. That is better than the $43.8bn it lost in the second quarter, though less than its $10.3bn profit a year ago amid a stockmarket boom. Operating earnings, a proxy for the cash generated by the firm&#x27;s businesses, rose compared with a year ago to $7.8bn.

A suicide-bomb attack at an army-training camp in Mogadishu, <strong>Somalia’s</strong> capital, left at least 10 dead. <strong>Al-Shabab</strong>, an affiliate of al-Qaeda, [claimed responsibility](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/03/somali-clans-are-revolting-against-jihadists). On Friday the army said it killed 100 al-Shabab fighters in clashes in the central state of Hirshabelle. A week ago al-Shabab killed 116 people in two bomb attacks in Mogadishu.

A fire at a bar in <strong>Russia </strong>killed at least 13 people, according to state media, after a drunk reveller fired a flare gun on the dancefloor. Around 250 people were evacuated from the venue in Kostroma, a city 300km north-east of Moscow. Lethal blazes are common in Russia; a fire at a Siberian [shopping mall](https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/04/05/russian-protests-over-the-kemerovo-fire-are-already-burning-out) killed at least 60 people in 2018.

<strong>American</strong> presidents current and past held competing [rallies](https://www.economist.com/mid-terms-2022) in the swing state of Pennsylvania ahead of Tuesday’s <strong>midterm elections</strong>. Barack Obama and Joe Biden staged a double-act in Philadelphia, where Mr Obama told Democrats that “truth and facts and logic and reason and basic decency are on the ballot”. Donald Trump arrived outside Pittsburgh to rouse Republicans.

<strong>Word of the week: </strong><em>pesantrens, </em>Indonesia’s Islamic boarding schools, testing grounds for the “eco-Islam” movement. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/11/03/indonesias-imams-are-doing-their-bit-for-the-environment).

## The battle for Pennsylvania

On Saturday, three days before the midterms, presidents current and past—Joe Biden, Donald Trump and Barack Obama—will descend on Pennsylvania for a final bout of campaigning. Democrats are keen to pick up the state’s [open Senate seat](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/11/03/the-road-to-senate-control-may-run-through-pennsylvania), which would allow them to keep control of Congress’s upper chamber even if they were to lose another close seat, like Nevada. A Republican victory could well hand control of the Senate to the Republican Party.

The Democratic candidate, John Fetterman, who suffered a stroke in May, held a steady polling lead this summer. But Mehmet Oz, the Trump-endorsed Republican contender, has since advanced in the polls. [Our forecast](https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-midterms-2022/forecast/senate/pennsylvania) puts him within a whisker of overtaking Mr Fetterman.

Whether the race has narrowed because establishment Republicans have “come home”, or because voters are concerned about Mr Fetterman’s fitness, it was always going to be a dogfight. And it may be some time before a winner is declared: poll workers cannot begin processing mailed ballots until election day.

## Campaign season begins in Malaysia

On Saturday campaigning for Malaysia’s general election, scheduled for November 19th, officially starts. But lawmakers have not stopped scheming since voters last had their say four years ago. In the interim three prime ministers from three coalition governments watched their backs until their necks were sore. Just about every party has tasted power, and is thus, in the eyes of voters, partly responsible for Malaysia’s mess. Prices are increasing, the currency is weakening and wages are stagnating.

The coalition of the historic ruling party, UMNO, has the best shot at forming a government. That is despite the [jailing](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/08/23/malaysias-disgraced-former-prime-minister-is-going-to-prison) of its previous prime minister, Najib Razak, for his role in the 1MDB affair that saw billions of dollars vanish from state coffers. The two other blocs despise each other. UMNO might fancy its chances in a divided field. But none of this means that the politicking will be over two weeks from now.

## A rugby tournament returns to Hong Kong

The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens, the city’s biggest sporting event, is back this weekend—just. The coronavirus pandemic meant the 2020 and 2021 editions were cancelled, while the 2022 event was postponed from its usual slot in April. 

The government’s original hair-brained scheme for the spectacularly boozy event—that fans could drink but not eat in the stadium to limit covid transmission—was thankfully binned. Still, capacity at the Hong Kong Stadium will be reduced, masks will be compulsory and the women’s event will not take place. The organisers expect most of the crowd to be locals, given the relatively recent relaxation of the rules governing foreign arrivals. Nevertheless the organiser, the Hong Kong Rugby Union, reports that ticket sales to locals are above average. On the field, Fiji remain the team to beat, having won seven of the past eight tournaments, as well as gold medals in the men’s event at the 2016 and 2020 Olympics. 

## Contemporary art among the pyramids

Visitors to Egypt’s Great Pyramid of Giza this month will see modern art next to ancient treasures. The second edition of “Forever is Now”, a public art exhibition, places contemporary sculptures and interactive installations alongside monuments such as the Great Sphinx. Meta, parent company of Instagram, has released augmented-reality filters to guide people around the sites. 

Art D’Égypte, the organiser, sought participation from 12 artists from around the world. Their brief was to think about immortality; some grapple with sustainability and environmental disruption. One of the works is an installation from Litre of Light, an organisation that helps poor communities construct solar lights. Meanwhile the question of how to meet the world’s growing energy needs without further endangering the future will be debated fiercely 500km to the south-east in Sharm el-Sheikh, where the [UN’s annual climate summit](https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2022/11/05/the-world-is-going-to-miss-the-totemic-1-5c-climate-target) begins on Sunday. 

## Weekend profile: Kari Lake, Arizona’s Republican candidate for governor

The first time she was “cancelled really hard”, as she puts it, Kari Lake did some soul searching. In 2019 a hot mic had caught Ms Lake—then a veteran television newsreader in Phoenix, Arizona—crudely dismissing concerns about her presence on Parler, a right-wing social network. “Fuck them,” she said of her detractors. “They’re 20-year-old dopes.”

After the tape leaked, the dopes called for Ms Lake to be fired. She spent a week off the air, but her unease only grew. She turned to God. She started comparing the Bible she kept on one side of her desk with the news scripts she kept on the other. Eventually, she quit broadcasting altogether, saying she was through with “having to read news that I felt wasn’t fully truthful”. Shortly thereafter she announced her candidacy as a Republican for [governor of Arizona](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/11/01/arizonas-midterm-races-are-full-of-election-deniers), in a video produced by her husband, a videographer with a penchant for soft-focus backgrounds.

Ms Lake enjoys a slight lead over her lacklustre Democratic opponent, Katie Hobbs, ahead of Tuesday’s election. She is revelling in her cancellation. Ms Lake frequently peddles the lie that the 2020 election was stolen, earning Donald Trump’s approval. She describes [immigration on Arizona’s southern border](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/10/04/the-biden-administration-is-quietly-completing-bits-of-donald-trumps-wall) as an “invasion”. She has accused Ms Hobbs of supporting sex education for youngsters and opposing medical care for infants who survive abortion attempts. Both characterisations are misleading. But unlike many of [Mr Trump’s acolytes](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/10/27/why-the-republicans-anti-democracy-turn-has-become-normalised), she is fully media-trained. Glenn Beck, a right-wing radio host, compares her speaking talent to that of Ronald Reagan. Ms Hobbs refuses to debate her—no doubt for fear of getting shown up.

Critics spy opportunism in Ms Lake’s recent political awakening. She says no politician since Reagan has thrilled her like Mr Trump, yet she voted for Barack Obama in 2008. She calls herself Christian from birth, and dismisses rumours that she dabbled in Buddhism. (The yoga was for stress relief, she says.) If she can convince Arizona voters that she is the real deal, the Lake playbook—ultra-smooth delivery of far-right talking points—could be a winner. Democrats are rightly worried.
