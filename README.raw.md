<strong>Meta’s</strong> share price fell by about a fifth, shaving more than $80bn from its market capitalisation, after the social-media firm reported a [lower-than-expected](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/10/16/how-much-trouble-is-mark-zuckerberg-in) quarterly profit. Revenues at Facebook’s parent company declined by 4% year-on-year, to $27.7bn. Weaker digital-ad spending continues to crimp growth at its social-media core.

Three heavily armed men killed at least 15 people and injured another 40 in an attack on a Shia shrine in Shiraz, a city in southern <strong>Iran</strong>. [Islamic State](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2017/06/07/the-jihadists-of-islamic-state-hit-iran), a Sunni terrorist group, claimed responsibility. Meanwhile Iranian security forces clashed with crowds honouring <strong>Mahsa Amini’s </strong>tomb in her Kurdish hometown of Saqez. Her death in police custody 40 days ago triggered [widespread and ongoing protests](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/18/irans-protests-spread-as-a-notorious-prison-burns) against Iran’s theocratic rulers.

The <strong>European Central Bank</strong> has doubled its key interest rate to 1.5%, the highest level since 2009, and signalled that it would increase further. The ECB is determined to curb “far too high” levels of inflation (the euro area’s figure was 9.9% in September). European leaders voiced concern over raising rates and dampening demand given that Europe is heading into a [recession](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/11/as-europe-falls-into-recession-russia-climbs-out).

<strong>Russia</strong> held its first <strong>nuclear drill</strong> since it invaded Ukraine, which simulated a retaliatory strike and was supervised by President Vladimir Putin via videolink. Earlier <strong>America’s </strong>president, Joe Biden, warned him that [deploying tactical nuclear weapons](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/17/how-to-detect-an-imminent-russian-nuclear-attack) would be an “incredibly serious mistake”. Separately, Ukraine’s government reported that 1,000 bodies had been exhumed in territories its armed forces liberated in the north-east of the country.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> posted underlying profits of $9.5bn in the third quarter, more than double the figure in the same period last year but a slowdown from a bumper second quarter. The war in Ukraine briefly pushed oil prices to $120 a barrel. Europe’s largest [oil and gas company](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/05/31/why-the-oil-price-is-spiking-again) said they would raise its payout to shareholders by 15% amid calls for a more stringent [windfall tax](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/03/19/windfall-taxes-on-energy-companies-are-a-bad-idea).

<strong>Stormont</strong>, Northern Ireland’s parliament, has been recalled in an eleventh-hour attempt to form a government. The devolved region’s power-sharing agreement collapsed in May, when [Sinn Féin](https://www.economist.com/britain/sinn-fein-has-become-northern-irelands-biggest-party/21809215), the left-wing party associated with Irish unification, [won the election](https://www.economist.com/britain/sinn-fein-has-become-northern-irelands-biggest-party/21809215). The DUP, which came second, want a [closer trade union](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/02/12/northern-irish-devolution-collapses-again) with Britain. This year’s second election will be triggered if no compromise is reached by midnight.

<strong>Elon Musk </strong>visited the headquarters of <strong>Twitter</strong>, the social-media firm he is [expected to buy](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/10/05/elon-musk-is-buying-twitter-really-probably) this week, having committed himself to a price of $44bn in April. He told staff he has no intention of sacking 75% of them, though he was quoted saying so. (Mr Musk says [a lot of things](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/06/how-worried-should-you-be-about-elon-musks-superpowers).) The <em>Wall Street Journal </em>reported that his banks have begun sending $13bn in financing to close the deal.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 30m, roughly the number of combatants killed in wars fought between countries over the past 200 years. [Read the full article](https://www.economist.com/interactive/international/2022/10/24/vladimir-putin-is-dragging-the-world-back-to-a-bloodier-time).

## A superficial rebound for America’s economy

Technically, it looks great. Data on Thursday showed that in the third quarter of the year America’s GDP growth accelerated to 2.6% on an annualised basis. That marks a sharp rebound after contractions in both the first and [second quarters](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/07/28/americas-gdp-shrinks-for-the-second-consecutive-quarter). The Democrats and Joe Biden will no doubt be grateful for positive headlines about the economy less than two weeks ahead of [midterm elections](https://www.economist.com/mid-terms-2022), even if they will probably still face a drubbing at the ballot box.

Viewed in more detail, the [economic picture](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/09/a-focus-on-gdp-understates-the-strength-of-americas-recovery) is less reassuring. Arithmetically, strong imports were a drag on GDP at the start of the year. More recently, imports have weakened, reflecting more sluggish domestic demand. Counter-intuitively, that makes GDP growth appear stronger now since fewer American dollars are going abroad. That does not mean that America is in a recession yet. But it does signal that it is losing steam.

## The ECB makes a tricky call

The decision of the[ European Central Bank](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/07/14/the-ecbs-masterplan-to-manipulate-markets) on Thursday was as expected: a second increase of the bank&#x27;s benchmark rates by 0.75 percentage points, bringing it to 1.5%. But a statement from the bank’s top brass suggests it may slow down its tightening in the coming months. That is because three important economic indicators all point in different directions.

The key number is the euro zone’s inflation rate, which soared to 9.9% in September, far above the[ bank’s 2% target](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/07/17/what-does-the-ecbs-new-target-mean-in-practice). That calls for a further steep rate rise. But data on economic sentiment suggest a screeching downturn is under way, especially in gas-hungry Germany. That calls for a rate cut.

A final consideration is wage growth. Employers and workers have struck mostly moderate agreements, providing no reason for rate increases. With energy prices falling thanks to a warm autumn in Europe, the ECB may decide to go softer next time.

## Putin’s propaganda parley

The Valdai discussion club began in 2004 as a Russian version of the [Davos conference](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/05/26/is-this-the-end-of-davos-man) of global bigwigs. Its mission was, mostly, to convince Western elites to invest in Russia. Those days are long gone. When President Vladimir Putin [addressed](https://www.economist.com/films/2022/09/23/we-read-between-the-lines-of-putins-speech) the meeting in Moscow on Thursday, it was to attack the West and to foretell its downfall.

Last year Mr Putin treated attendees to a wide-ranging three-hour discussion in which he lambasted Western liberalism and praised [obscure Russian nationalist philosophers](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/07/28/vladimir-putin-is-in-thrall-to-a-distinctive-brand-of-russian-fascism). This year he rehashed that material with the added urgency of his [invasion of Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/15/vladimir-putins-war-is-failing-the-west-should-help-it-fail-faster). The conference’s theme, “A Post-Hegemonic World: Security and Justice for Everyone”, is central to Russian propaganda, which presents the war as an effort to free the world from Western domination. The president bent on conquering and annexing a neighbouring country accused the West of a “bloody” attempt to “deny the sovereignty of countries and peoples, their autonomy and uniqueness”. Ukrainians have grown used to such shamelessness.

## Credit Suisse unveils its survival plan

Credit Suisse issued a devastating third-quarter report on Thursday, disclosing SFr4bn ($4bn) in losses. Even more attention will be paid to the bank’s strategy to recover: it announced “radical” plans to raise an equivalent of SFr4bn by selling new shares, cutting 9,000 staff and spinning off some of its business. A recent [string of risk-management and compliance disasters](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/03/credit-suisse-and-the-hunt-for-the-weakest-link-in-global-finance) incurred losses ranging from $1.7bn with the collapse of [Greensill](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/03/06/greensill-capitals-woes-will-reverberate-widely), a lender, to more than $5bn when Archegos, a hedge fund, went bust last year. This month the bank had to fork over fines to America (linked to its residential mortgage-backed securities business) and France (to settle a money-laundering case).

Adding to the turmoil, its top management ranks have been in a state of flux. Tidjane Thiam quit in 2020 after the bank admitted to spying on former staff. His successor, Thomas Gottstein, was replaced in August this year with Ulrich Koerner, a restructuring expert. Mr Koerner may well be able to whip the venerable firm [back into shape](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/28/investment-banks-are-sharpening-the-axe); he will need to convince financial markets of his determination to do so.

## The populist’s guide to getting ahead

The memoir of Benjamin “Bibi” Netanyahu is published in Britain on Thursday, following its release in America and Israel last week. Now the leader of Israel’s opposition, Mr Netanyahu was the country’s [longest-serving prime minister](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/10/30/netanyahus-shadow-starts-to-recede-in-israel) until he was ousted in 2021. In “Bibi: My Story” he recounts his rise up the ranks and 15 years in office. Other power-hungry populists will find plenty of tips—these include: play up existential threats to your country, don’t be afraid to spar with America, exploit voters’ greatest fears and bash the elite (even if it doesn’t exist).

But Mr Netanyahu’s motivation for picking up a pen is not altruistic. Instead, he wants to [convince the world](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2020/09/10/serbia-and-kosovo-awkwardly-embrace-israel) that Israel must remain strong and unyielding in the face of Iran’s nuclear programme and Palestinians’ demands. And he wants to persuade Israeli voters that he is the only man who can ensure this, and that they must therefore re-elect him prime minister in the [election](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/06/20/israels-government-collapses-prompting-the-fifth-election-in-four-years) due on November 1st.
