Shares in <strong>Alphabet</strong>, <strong>Apple</strong> and <strong>Amazon</strong> all slid after the tech giants reported weak results for the last quarter of 2022. Poor iPhone sales caused Apple’s quarterly revenues to fall by 5.5% year on year, the first decline in more than three years. Alphabet said quarterly revenues grew by just 1%, to $76bn, undershooting expectations as digital advertisers tightened their belts. Amazon reported that net income was just $278m, down by 98%. <strong>Meta</strong> also reported a 4.5% decline in sales, but an [optimistic](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/02/things-are-looking-up-for-meta) revenue forecast caused its shares to soar. 

The Pentagon<strong> is </strong>tracking a suspected <strong>Chinese</strong> spy balloon flying over parts of <strong>America</strong>. Officials decided against shooting it down because of fears about falling debris. The balloon was first spotted in the northern state of Montana. The incident will heighten [tensions between America and China](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/01/29/a-new-challenge-to-relations-between-america-and-china). Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, is expected to visit Beijing next week. 

<strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong>, president of the European Commission, arrived in Kyiv for meetings with Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, about his country eventually joining the EU. European officials will also discuss imposing new sanctions on Russia. Meanwhile on a visit to Stalingrad, scene of a desperate Russian victory against the Nazis 80 years ago, Vladimir Putin promised to again repel German tanks in Ukraine. 

<strong>Israel’s</strong> foreign minister said his country would sign a “historic peace agreement” with <strong>Sudan </strong>later this year in Washington. His statement followed a meeting with officials in Khartoum. Since 2020, three other Arab countries—Bahrain, Morocco, and the United Arab Emirates—have [normalised relations](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/01/03/israels-new-government-will-test-the-ties-with-arab-states) with Israel at America’s urging. Sudan had agreed to, but has yet to implement a deal.

All border restrictions between mainland <strong>China</strong> and <strong>Hong Kong</strong> will be removed from Monday. The government in Beijing had for three years severely restricted travel between the two, in an attempt to keep [covid-19](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/02/02/will-we-ever-know-how-many-people-died-of-covid-19-in-china) at bay. Mainlanders had previously made up nearly 80% of Hong Kong’s tourists. The recession-hit territory also announced plans to give away 500,000 flights, to kick start its recovery.

A Brazilian senator alleged that <strong>Jair Bolsonaro</strong> attended a meeting to discuss ways to overturn Brazil’s presidential election result of 2022. Following Mr Bolsonaro’s defeat, Marcos do Val says that a plan was discussed to secretly record the head of the electoral court, in an attempt to obtain an incriminating statement. A [bolsonarista insurrection](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/01/12/how-brazil-should-deal-with-the-bolsonarista-insurrection) in January failed to halt the inauguration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

Shares in the <strong>Adani Group </strong>[continued to plunge](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/01/what-next-for-gautam-adanis-embattled-empire) during trading on Friday. The group’s ten listed firms have now lost more than $120bn, about half their market value, since Hindenburg Research, a small investment firm, accused the conglomerate of fraud. The Indian stock exchange restricted trading in two of the group’s firms. Meanwhile India’s central bank has asked lenders to disclose their exposure to the group. 

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 100,000, the number of Russian exiles who have taken refuge in Georgia. [Read the full story.](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/01/31/georgia-is-drifting-into-the-kremlins-orbit)

## The woes of the Adani empire

On Wednesday Adani Enterprises [cancelled a secondary share offering](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/02/01/what-next-for-gautam-adanis-embattled-empire), which had been fully subscribed, after its share price plunged. By Thursday the Adani Group’s losses had reached $100bn. In a four-minute video the firm’s Indian founder, [Gautam Adani](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/01/31/who-is-gautam-adani), dismissed concerns about its finances and insisted that the move was to “insulate investors from potential losses”.  
  
 The rout started last week when Hindenburg Research, an American short-seller, [accused](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/27/a-short-seller-rattles-gautam-adanis-empire) the Adani Group of accounting fraud and share-price manipulation—charges it denies. The threat does not appear existential. Mr Adani is considered an able operator and his companies own many valuable assets. No rating agency has yet reappraised the group’s debt, which boasts an investment grade.

Yet it is hard to believe that his grand investment plans will be unaffected. Between 2023 and 2027 his group was forecast to spend more than $50bn on investments. If the yields on Adani bonds remain elevated and its share prices depressed, securing the necessary cash will prove difficult. Foreign investors are not taking any chances. In just two recent days, global funds pulled a net $1.5bn from the Indian stockmarket.

## Sweden and Finland discuss NATO bids

When Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, welcomes his Finnish counterpart, Sanna Marin, to Stockholm on Thursday, he will be looking for a show of solidarity. After Russia invaded Ukraine the Nordic neighbours decided to give up their long-standing non-aligned status, and [applied to join NATO](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/05/15/in-applying-to-nato-finland-and-sweden-give-the-lie-to-putins-claims). But they were blocked by Turkey, which like all NATO members has a veto. Turkey extracted promises from both countries to crack down on residents associated with the [Kurdistan Workers’ Party](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/06/28/what-is-the-pkk) (PKK), a violent separatist group in Turkey.

Now Turkey has new demands. Last month a far-right Danish politician burnt a Koran outside Denmark’s embassy in Stockholm. The act prompted protests across the Muslim world. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, says he is ready to approve Finland’s NATO application, but that Sweden must outlaw Koran-burning before it can join. Mr Kristersson has condemned the act, but says his country’s laws on freedom of expression are non-negotiable. Ms Marin will no doubt pledge to stand by her Swedish friends.

## Global democracy remains under threat

The steady retreat of democracy that began in 2016 at last came to an end in 2022. Yet a hoped-for revival did not materialise. According to the [Democracy Index](https://www.eiu.com/n/campaigns/democracy-index-2022/?utm_source=economist&amp;utm_medium=espresso&amp;utm_campaign=democracy-index-2022), an annual snapshot published by <em>The Economist</em>’s sister company, EIU, the average score among 167 countries ticked up by just 0.01 points, to 5.29 out of 10. More than a third of people worldwide still live under authoritarian rule and less than half live in a democracy. 

The lifting of pandemic-related restrictions almost everywhere last year—China was a notable exception until December—improved scores in the “civil liberties” category. But any gains were wiped out by democratic backsliding elsewhere. A [bungled attempt](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/12/07/after-a-bungled-coup-attempt-perus-president-falls) by the now-ousted president of Peru to shut down Congress resulted in the country’s being downgraded to a “hybrid regime”. Burkina Faso suffered not one but [two coups](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/01/for-the-second-time-this-year-soldiers-stage-a-coup-in-burkina-faso). But it was [Russia](https://www.economist.com/international/how-vladimir-putin-provokes-and-complicates-the-struggle-against-autocracy/21808339) that recorded the biggest democratic decline of any country in the world, falling 22 places to 146th.

## The BoE’s interest-rate decision

As expected the Bank of England raised its interest rate to 4% on Thursday, from 3.5%, its tenth consecutive increase. Central-bank watchers, though, were looking keenly for a signal from the central bank’s nine-member monetary-policy committee about the pace of future rises. In a statement the committee was more doveish than in recent months. While recognising the “considerable uncertainties around the outlook”, including on the impact of previous rises, it suggested that only unexpectedly bad news about inflation would require a further rise next time it meets.

Before the announcement the bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, had suggested that falling wholesale gas prices will make it easier to reduce inflation without steep increases in rates, which would be good news for the economy. But the bank’s chief economist, Huw Pill, had warned that Britain faces a unique combination of challenges that could cause inflation to persist more stubbornly than in America or Europe. If he is right then, interest rates may have to continue rising.

## Why China chooses to forget

Zhang Hongbing’s mother was executed in 1970 after being branded a counter-revolutionary. Such horrors were not uncommon during the [Cultural Revolution](https://www.economist.com/china/2016/05/14/it-was-the-worst-of-times), a decade of Maoist madness that began in 1966 and saw up to 2m people killed for supposed political transgressions. But the case of Mr Zhang’s mother stands out, because he and his father had been her accusers.

Mr Zhang’s memory of the event seems strange to Tania Branigan, the author of “Red Memory”. He existed in it “as a Maoist algorithm: inputs, rules, outputs”, she writes. How people remember the Cultural Revolution—or why they have forgotten it—is the theme of her penetrating book.

China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has [suppressed](https://www.economist.com/china/2021/11/06/xi-jinping-is-rewriting-history-to-justify-his-rule-for-years-to-come) discussion of the Cultural Revolution. He has accumulated more power than any leader since Mao Zedong and created his own cult of personality. “What makes the era’s lessons so vital is also what makes them impermissible,” writes Ms Branigan.
