<strong>Turkey’s </strong>president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, declared a three-month state of emergency in ten provinces affected by [large earthquakes](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/02/06/massive-earthquakes-in-turkey-and-northern-syria-kill-thousands) in the south of the country and neighbouring <strong>Syria</strong>. The quakes on Monday have already left at least 7,900 people dead. That number looks certain to rise; the World Health Organisation suggested that fatalities could reach 20,000. Rescue efforts continued on Tuesday, with America sending aid to both [Turkey and Syria](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/02/07/the-scale-of-the-disaster-in-turkey-and-syria-keeps-growing). The initial quake’s epicentre was near the Turkish city of Gaziantep and had a magnitude of 7.8.

In the <strong>state-of-the-union address</strong>, Joe Biden appealed for Republican support for policies that he said would reduce America’s debt, aid “hard-working families” and deal with the threat from China. The prospect of bipartisanship appeared dim, however. Republicans accused the president of obsessing over “woke fantasies”. Despite rock-bottom approval ratings Mr Biden is expected soon to announce that he will run for president again in 2024. 

Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands said <strong>Ukraine</strong> would receive [at least 100](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/01/25/what-makes-germanys-leopard-2-tank-the-best-fit-for-ukraine) <strong>Leopard 1 tanks</strong> in the coming months. <strong>Germany </strong>has approved the export of up to 178. Separately, America approved the sale of weapons worth $10bn to Poland, including the HIMARS rocket launcher. Poland has ramped up its defences since Russia invaded its neighbour.

<strong>Microsoft</strong> unveiled an AI-enhanced version of its Bing search engine. It is powered by the same technology behind ChatGPT, a chatbot created by OpenAI, a Microsoft-backed startup, and only accommodates a limited number of queries at present. Microsoft’s AI investment represents an [attempt to win market share](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/30/the-race-of-the-ai-labs-heats-up) in search from Google, which just announced its own AI-powered chatbot called Bard.

<strong>Jerome Powell</strong>, chair of America’s <strong>Federal Reserve</strong>, warned that interest rates may rise higher than [markets have anticipated](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/02/07/surging-stocks-undermine-a-hallowed-investing-rule) in order to restrain inflation. An unexpectedly strong jobs report last week, Mr Powell said during an event in Washington, “underscores the message” of caution. On Wednesday the Fed raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point.

Thousands attended the funeral prayers of <strong>Pervez Musharraf</strong>, Pakistan’s former [president](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/02/05/pervez-musharraf-was-one-of-pakistans-better-dictators), in Karachi, a city in the south of the country. Mr Musharraf, who died on Sunday, led a coup in 1999 and went on to rule Pakistan for nearly a decade, first as “chief executive” then as president. He had lived in Dubai since 2016. 

<strong>Gustavo Dudamel</strong> will leave the Los Angeles Philharmonic to lead the <strong>New York Philharmonic</strong> in 2026. The Venezuelan-born conductor was appointed music director in Los Angeles in 2009, aged just 27, and has [breathed fresh air](https://www.economist.com/1843/2013/12/23/gustavo-dudamels-next-mountain) into the rarefied world of classical music. His mandate in New York is to help revitalise the financially troubled orchestra; he called it a “very interesting” challenge.

<strong>Correction: </strong>In Tuesday’s edition we incorrectly wrote that ChatGPT can generate images and videos. In fact it is OpenAI, a Microsoft-backed artificial-intelligence startup that created ChatGPT, which builds models that aim to do so. Sorry.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>2.2%, the contraction of Russia’s GDP last year, which defied many economists’ expectations of an annual decline of 10% or more. [Read the full story.](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/02/04/russias-technocrats-keep-funds-flowing-for-vladimir-putins-war)

## Biden’s state of the union

President Joe Biden delivered the annual state-of-the-union address to Congress on Tuesday. With Republicans now in control of the House of Representatives, Mr Biden’s window for passing big-ticket legislation has closed. Still, in his speech he urged bipartisanship and spoke directly to his Republican detractors, some of whom heckled him. 

In preparation for a [re-election bid](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/10/joe-biden-should-not-seek-re-election) next year, expected to be announced soon, the president reminded Americans of his job-creation efforts and major infrastructure and climate bills. He pledged to make “the supply chain for America [[begin] in America](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/02/02/joe-bidens-effort-to-remake-the-economy-is-ambitious-risky-and-selfish)”. Foreign policy—namely America’s support for Ukraine and its competition with China—also featured in the address. Even so, Mr Biden knew that some would scrutinise the delivery of his speech as much as its substance. His age, 80, is a turn-off for many voters. That perhaps explains his spirited and spontaneous retorts to opposition lawmakers on the right side of the chamber.

## Poor construction makes earthquakes more deadly

The huge earthquakes that [struck](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/02/06/massive-earthquakes-in-turkey-and-northern-syria-kill-thousands) southern Turkey and northern Syria on Monday have killed at least 7,900 people. They were the strongest in the region since one near Istanbul in 1999 that killed over 17,000 people. That disaster, and botched search-and-rescue efforts, exposed a deeply flawed urban development model, corrupt building practices and lack of preparedness in Turkey. Some problems persist.

Under Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in [power](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/01/16/turkey-is-still-just-a-democracy-but-it-is-not-certain-to-remain-that-way) since 2003, disaster response has improved. More than 3m housing units have been renovated and strengthened. Yet apartment blocks built on the cheap or in defiance of building codes continue to crowd Turkish cities and towns. An amnesty on unregistered construction work, passed by Mr Erdogan’s government in 2018 and which has had 9m applications, has not helped. It risked turning Turkish cities into “graveyards” in an earthquake, Cemal Gokce, the chairman of the Chamber of Civil Engineers, said a year later. His words may have proved prescient. 

## How is big oil spending its profit bonanza?

The coffers of big oil companies are overflowing. So far this year Shell unveiled net profits for 2022 of nearly $40bn; during the same period ExxonMobil made a record net profit of $55.7bn and Chevron’s doubled. BP added to the haul on Tuesday, reporting a profit of $27.7bn (£23bn) for 2022, more than double its total for 2021 ($12.8bn). TotalEnergies will also announce results on Wednesday. In total the five oil “supermajors” may have raked in around $200bn in profits.  
  
 Some of this bounty will flow back to shareholders, but a wedge will be invested. Where and how that money is spent is changing. Bosses need energy that is faster to market, less risky to develop, cleaner to produce and closer to home. Having been forced to abandon their assets in [Russia](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/01/29/how-russia-dodges-oil-sanctions-on-an-industrial-scale) after the invasion of Ukraine, some are diverting investments to the Americas, a region with relatively low-risk and low-cost reserves. Oil companies are also responding to pressure from activists and policymakers to decarbonise their portfolios. BP, for instance, vows to invest a cumulative $55bn to $65bn in low-carbon sectors between 2023 and 2030.

## Australia’s next interest-rate rise

Battling rising prices, Australian central bankers have raised interest rates eight times since May. Their fight is not yet over. Inflation has been slower to ease down under than in Europe and America; in December it hit an annual rate of 7.8%, the highest since 1990. The Reserve Bank of Australia responded by bumping up interest rates by another 0.25 percentage points on Tuesday, to 3.35%. It has not hit those heights since September 2012. 

Australia has some of the world’s most indebted households, and the hikes are starting to hurt. The bank’s rates rise means it will cost Aussies almost A$1,000 ($692) more per month to service a A$500,000 mortgage than it did last April, according to AMP, an Australian bank. Since then [house prices](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/24/where-the-coming-housing-crunch-will-be-most-painful) have plunged by almost 9%. And more will suffer this year as their fixed-rate loans end. To avoid a recession, monetary policymakers may soon have to pull their punches.

## A landmark art show in the Gulf

The Sharjah Biennial in the United Arab Emirates opens on Tuesday to mark 30 years since the event’s founding. The contemporary-art exhibition has always punched above its weight thanks to the ambition of Sharjah’s ruling family, who are keen curators and collectors. Still, this year’s iteration is hotly anticipated—and poignant. Its focus was conceived by Okwui Enwezor (pictured), a Nigerian curator who died of cancer in 2019. During his lifetime Mr Enwezor did more than almost any other curator to shape the way the contemporary-art world thinks about history and colonialism.

Those themes underpin the show, which is titled “Thinking Historically in the Present” and curated by Hoor Al Qasimi, director of the Sharjah Art Foundation. In five towns across the emirate, the event will display new work by an array of artists. They include Wangechi Mutu, a Kenyan-American painter and sculptor; Sir Steve McQueen, a British film-maker; Philippe Parreno, a French conceptual artist; and Sir John Akomfrah, a Ghanaian-born British artist and director. For lovers of contemporary art it promises to be worth a trip.
