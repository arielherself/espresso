A lawyer for<strong> Donald Trump</strong> signed a statement in June declaring that all classified material held at Mr Trump’s home in Florida had been returned to the government, according to the <em>New York Times</em>. But on August 8th [federal agents reportedly removed](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/09/an-fbi-raid-on-donald-trumps-home-ignites-a-political-firestorm) 11 sets of classified documents, including material marked “top secret”. The warrant to search Mr Trump’s home was issued because America’s Department of Justice said it believed that the former president violated <strong>the Espionage Act</strong>, which prohibits the possession or transmission of national security information.

<strong>Sir Salman Rushdie</strong>, a Booker-prizewinning [novelist](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/09/05/salman-rushdies-new-novel-is-a-metafictional-romp) who was stabbed as he was about to deliver a lecture in upstate New York, has been taken off a ventilator and is able to talk, according to his agent. A 24-year-old man from New Jersey has been charged with attempted murder. Sir Salman has lived under the threat of violence since his fourth novel, “The Satanic Verses”, was published in 1988. Some Muslims thought it blasphemous. Iran’s then leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, called for his death.

Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said that Russian troops who fire at the <strong>Zaporizhzhia</strong> nuclear plant will become “special targets”. Russia [seized](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/03/04/europes-largest-nuclear-plant-shuts-down-after-a-russian-attack) the facility, Europe’s largest, in March. Mr Zelensky claimed that Russian soldiers were hitting Zaporizhzhia as an act of provocation, and were also firing missiles at Ukrainian forces from within its compound.

At least seven people were injured, some seriously, after gunmen opened fire near the Western Wall in <strong>Jerusalem</strong>. Israeli police are treating the incident as terrrorism. Last week a ceasefire was agreed between Israel and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militant group, after several PiJ leaders [were killed](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/07/the-attack-on-gaza-may-bolster-israels-prime-minister) by Israeli drones. It is unclear whether the events are linked, but tensions have been high.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Saudi Aramco</strong>, one of the world’s biggest oil producers, posted record profits for the second quarter running. High oil prices pushed net income to $48.4bn in the second quarter, up 90% year-on-year. Saudi Arabia and other members of OPEC, a cartel of oil producers, have been slow to increase production, despite requests from the West in an effort to lower [soaring energy costs](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/10/how-to-help-with-energy-bills).

<strong>Germany’s</strong> energy-network regulator said the country must <strong>cut gas use</strong> by 20% to avoid shortages this winter. The government, meanwhile, said public buildings will turn down thermostats in winter to 19°C (66°F). The [looming crisis](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter) stems from curtailed flows of Russian gas to Germany, seemingly in retaliation for European sanctions on Russia.

With around 30% of votes counted in <strong>Kenya’s presidential election</strong>, Raila Odinga has a six-point lead over William Ruto, according to the country’s election commission. Mr Odinga is on his fifth presidential bid, having probably been [cheated](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/07/why-kenyas-election-matters) out of a win at least once. Counting of the vote, which took place on Tuesday, has been painfully slow.

## Run, Ron? The appeal of Ron DeSantis

On Sunday Ron DeSantis, Florida’s Republican governor, will speak at a rally for his party’s gubernatorial candidate in New Mexico, Mark Ronchetti. It is just one stop on a national tour that Mr DeSantis is embarking on to support other candidates, including those backed by Donald Trump, rather than focusing on his own campaign.

It is a show of party unity that Mr DeSantis is spending his time stumping for other candidates, but it also raises questions about his own ambitions. Should Mr Trump not make a presidential bid in 2024, Mr DeSantis would be the likely Republican frontrunner. In a straw poll of attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas, released last week, 69% of people said they preferred Mr Trump as the candidate in 2024; Mr DeSantis came second, with 24%. Mr DeSantis may be calculating that for now it is better to shore up his popularity with Trump supporters. After all, at only 43 he is easily young enough to wait until 2028.

## America and Canada challenge Mexico’s energy policies

On Sunday America and Canada will start negotiations with Mexico over its energy policies. Mexico is accused of breaching USMCA, the North American free-trade deal, by favouring state-owned energy companies. Among the policies being challenged is the way a law has been changed so that electricity produced by CFE, Mexico’s state power company, enters the grid first (and often in preference to the cheapest or cleanest power, which is usually made by private, often American or Canadian, companies).   
  
 It is unlikely that the discussions will lead to agreement. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Mexico’s president, is determined to boost CFE and Pemex, the national oil giant, even if that makes Mexico’s power [dirtier and more expensive](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/01/08/andres-manuel-lopez-obradors-energy-policy-will-hurt-mexico). By undercutting the liberalisation of the energy sector carried out in 2013 he is also hurting Mexican private companies. If talks fail, a panel of experts will decide if Mexico has violated USMCA. A ruling against Mexico could lead to sanctions from America and Canada.

## The European Championships find strength in numbers

Sports fans waking up in Munich on Sunday are spoiled for choice. Fancy breakfast in the Olympiapark while watching a triathlon? Or how about track cycling at the Neue Messe München? Or table tennis at the Audi Dome? Until August 21st Munich is hosting an experiment. The associations of nine sports—including athletics, beach volleyball, canoeing, cycling, gymnastics, rowing, sport climbing, triathlon and table tennis—have decided to run their European tournaments in tandem in a single city. 

The idea is that these smaller sports have a better chance of commanding bigger audiences if they work together. That makes sense: after all, the Olympics is more than the sum of its parts. But the European Championships also wants to avoid some Olympic-sized pitfalls. It chose Munich because no new tourist facilities or venues needed to be constructed. Consequently, its budget is around 1% of Tokyo’s 2020 Olympics. It is a lean, efficient approach that could catch on.

## Why thinking hard exhausts your brain

Mental exhaustion is a strange sensation; not quite drowsiness, but an inability to think straight. The body may feel fine, yet the brain wants to do little more than watch television. Researchers writing in <em>Current Biology</em>, a journal, went in search of a physiological basis for this frazzled feeling—and may have found one.

For over six hours, 24 volunteers performed difficult mental problems that required intense cognition—another group was given easier versions. Their brains were scanned throughout the mock workday, which suggested that mental graft induced the build-up of a neurotransmitter called glutamate in the forebrain. As glutamate can be toxic, it seems the brain has to limit cognition to avoid an overload. The industrious volunteers’ decision-making also changed—they began to favour instant rewards over delayed gratification. Your brain on energy-saver mode should be spared important decisions. After a stressful day in the office, some mindless channel-surfing may be just what it needs.

## Weekend profile: Robert Habeck, Germany’s energy hero

Olaf Scholz may be Germany’s chancellor, but to many the man of the hour in Berlin is Robert Habeck, his vice-chancellor and minister for economy and climate change. This is not just because the senior-most Green in the three-party ruling coalition pips his boss in the polls: since this government took office in December Mr Habeck has consistently been named the country’s most popular politician. It is also because his job as energy supremo puts the chatty, studiedly casual 52-year-old on the front lines of the [biggest crisis](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/08/11/germany-is-facing-dramatic-change-in-many-dimensions-all-at-once) Germany has faced in a generation.

By most accounts Mr Habeck has done well. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February placed Germany in a dilemma. Decades of misguided policy had hooked Europe’s biggest economy on Russian fossil fuels. Pipelines from Siberia supplied 55% of its natural gas. But with a mix of charm, money and dealmaking, Mr Habeck has helped shield Germany from potential blackmail by trimming gas use and finding new suppliers. Enhancing his reputation for pragmatism (some would say lack of principle), the vice-chancellor muted his Green beliefs to reignite mothballed coal-fired power stations. A similar nose-holding green light may also keep Germany’s last three nuclear power plants open. They were to close in December as part of a longstanding plan to scrap nuclear power. Polls show even a majority of Green voters realise that, right now, that would be stupid.

Mr Habeck, who hails from Germany’s northernmost state, Schleswig-Holstein, earned a PhD in literature before entering politics. But it is his trademark three-day stubble, preference for open-necked shirts and penchant for blunt honesty that seem to please voters. He has also won points for working smoothly with Annalena Baerbock, the foreign minister, whose choice as the Greens’ candidate for chancellor in last year’s election was tough on Mr Habeck, by his own admission. But the easygoing manner disguises a sharp statesman. Visiting Ukraine last summer, Mr Habeck suggested supplying the country with defensive weapons. Rivals from left, right and centre called him irresponsible. Who looks silly now?
