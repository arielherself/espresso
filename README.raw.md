<strong>NATO’s</strong> secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said that it is “likely” that a [missile that hit a farm in Poland](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/16/russia-needs-a-respite-so-the-west-must-help-ukraine-fight-on) was fired by Ukraine’s air-defence force. He added that it was “not Ukraine’s fault”, since the country was defending itself against Russian missile attacks. At a press conference after an emergency NATO meeting Mr Stoltenberg said that the alliance&#x27;s “top priority” is providing air defences to Ukraine.

<strong>Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</strong>, Brazil’s [incoming president](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/11/03/lulas-foreign-policy-ambitions-will-be-tempered-by-circumstances), was greeted enthusiastically at <strong>COP27</strong>, the UN climate summit in Egypt. Lula told delegates that “Brazil is back” and promised to fight deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. Germany and Norway have signalled that they are willing to help revive the “Amazon Fund”, a coalition working to protect the area.

<strong>Mitch McConell</strong> was re-elected leader of the Republican party in America’s Senate, winning 37-10 against Rick Scott, who was backed by<strong> Donald Trump </strong>and other right-wingers. The challenge was the first that Mr McConnell, who has led his party in the Senate since 2007, has faced, and marks the latest instance of [Republican infighting](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/10/a-republican-victory-will-be-much-smaller-than-democrats-feared). Last night, Mr Trump [announced](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/16/of-course-donald-trump-is-running-again) that he would run for the presidency in 2024, defying some of his party’s senior advisers.

<strong>Britain’s annual inflation rate</strong> reached 11.1% in October, up from 10.1% in September and a <strong>41-year high</strong>. The [cost of food](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/07/food-prices-are-outpacing-wider-inflation-across-most-of-the-world) and non-alcoholic drink, for instance, rose by 16.2%. Britain’s chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is expected to raise taxes in his [Autumn budget on Thursday](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/10/the-best-ways-to-fix-britains-budget). Meanwhile, Dominic Raab, Britain’s deputy prime minister, requested an independent investigation into accusations of bullying made against him.

Some 15 trucks loaded with food entered the Ethiopian region of <strong>Tigray,</strong> the first such deliveries since the <strong>Ethiopian government </strong>and Tigrayan rebels made peace on November 2nd. As part of the pact that froze a [two-year-long civil war](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/04/a-peace-deal-highlights-the-pointlessness-of-ethiopias-war), Ethiopia’s government agreed to allow aid to enter Tigray unhindered. Some 6m people live in the region, many of whom are on the brink of starvation.

<strong>Elon Musk</strong> said he would reduce his time at <strong>Twitter </strong>and eventually install a new boss at the social network. Shares in Tesla, Mr Musk’s electric-vehicle firm, slipped recently amid investors’ unease over the time that the [billionaire is devoting to Twitter](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/11/07/elon-musks-challenge-to-management-thinking), which he acquired for $44bn last month. Earlier, Mr Musk sent an ultimatum to Twitter’s employees: commit to a new “hardcore” working environment or leave the company.

<strong>Tencent</strong>, a Chinese video-game giant, reported revenues of 140bn yuan ($19.8bn) in its third quarter, a fall of 2% from the same period a year earlier and its second consecutive quarterly drop. China’s [crackdown on tech](https://www.economist.com/business/can-chinese-big-tech-learn-to-love-big-brother/21809084) has hurt the firm’s growth. The company has lost close to 60% of its market value since February 2021 and is planning layoffs.

## Vladimir Putin’s ghost at the G20

Russia’s president stayed away from[ the G20 summit](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/11/13/the-dynamics-of-distrust-around-the-g20-summit) in Bali, yet haunted the gathering. The conflict aggravates the many global problems, from inflation to food shortages, that leaders were grappling with. Many countries felt they were paying the price for a faraway conflict. President Joko Widodo, the Indonesian summit host, warned that “if the war does not end, it will be difficult for the world to move forward.”

Yet the war kept intruding. On Wednesday morning Western leaders broke off for crisis talks after an explosion killed two men in Poland during a volley of Russian missiles on Ukraine. NATO later said it was not a Russian attack on the alliance, but probably a Ukrainian air-defence missile that had gone astray. Escalation averted, but the war goes on. So does the diplomatic battle to isolate Russia. The G20 final communiqué said that most states condemned the war, despite “different assessments” of the situation. It was a partial victory for the West.

## America’s Respect for Marriage Act

When America’s Supreme Court[ overhauled the right to abortion](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/24/the-supreme-court-erases-the-constitutional-right-to-abortion), it also raised the spectre of curtailing [other liberties](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/05/30/what-the-abolition-of-americas-right-to-abortion-could-mean-for-other-rights). In agreeing with the decision, a conservative justice, [Clarence Thomas](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/03/who-is-clarence-thomas), wrote that the court “should reconsider” rulings protecting same-sex marriage and access to contraception, too. On Wednesday Congress is expected to pass a law codifying same-sex and interracial marriage—both of which are legal because of Supreme Court rulings rather than federal legislation.

The Respect for Marriage Act has been kicking around for a decade, but was revived in July. It would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, passed by a Republican-controlled Congress in 1996, which allowed states to ban gay marriage, but was later defanged by two Supreme Court decisions.

Few Senate Republicans publicly support the bill. But Democrats say they have enough votes to ensure it will pass—and it received 47 votes from House Republicans in July. With more than 70% of Americans telling pollsters they support gay marriage, protecting it is popular.

## NASA takes off, at last

Just before 2am local time on Wednesday at the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, NASA launched its [Space Launch System](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/08/24/nasas-space-launch-system-is-yesterdays-rocket) rocket. The uncrewed SLS was originally scheduled to fly in 2016. The rocket that actually left the pad was assembled in 2021, but its launch was delayed repeatedly, twice because of problems with its engines.

More recently the rocket was left out during Hurricane Nicole on November 10th, though NASA’s engineers reckon no significant damage was done. But even its successful launch is unlikely to quiet its critics. Built using recycled parts of the Space Shuttle, and as much a job-creation programme as anything else, the SLS has [cost $23bn](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/28/nasas-newest-rocket-is-a-colossal-waste-of-money) to develop. Estimates for a single launch touch $2bn (at least). It has competition, too. SpaceX, a private firm, is building a similar rocket called Starship, and is aiming for launch costs of just 1% of that. In theory, as part of NASA’s Artemis programme, the SLS will return American astronauts to the Moon in 2025. Almost no one thinks that deadline will be met.

## China changes direction

Declining economic growth has finally crossed a pain threshold for China’s leaders. For over two and a half years policymakers have been cracking down on the spread of [covid-19](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/09/financial-markets-bet-on-an-end-to-chinas-zero-covid-policy) and runaway [property-sector](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/how-a-housing-downturn-could-wreck-chinas-growth-model/21805115) debt, with dire effects. Now they have announced some big changes.

Quarantine times for inbound travellers and close contacts of those testing positive for covid have been reduced. And bank loans to [property developers](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/14/a-radical-shift-in-chinas-property-and-pandemic-policies) due to be repaid within the next six months can now be extended. The plans, in theory, will get people spending more money and developers building more homes. But big questions remain. 

Loosened covid restrictions could lead to widespread outbreaks. In cities such as Guangzhou cases are already rising rapidly. It is unclear yet how authorities will deal with this. Easing in the property sector will stop defaults but this does not guarantee people will buy new homes in droves. A boost to economic growth could be a way off.

## Maradona’s “hand of God” ball at auction

The football that [Diego Maradona](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2020/12/03/diego-maradona-died-on-november-25th) punched into the goal, in the 1986 World Cup quarter-final match between Argentina and England, goes on sale in London on Wednesday. Maradona later said the “hand of God” had intervened. A few minutes later the Argentine scored what became known as the “goal of the century”—arguably the greatest solo run in the history of the sport. It cemented Maradona’s reputation as a sporting deity.

The sale will make Ali Bin Nasser, the Tunisian who refereed the match (but did not see the handball), a rich man. The estimate for the now rather deflated ball at auction is around £3m ($3.5m). The number 10 jersey Maradona wore that day, and swapped after the game with England’s midfielder, Steve Hodge, sold for £7.1m in May. The World Cup, which kicks off in [Qatar](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/10/the-world-cup-is-tarnished-should-fans-enjoy-it-anyway) on Sunday, could fuel interest from bidders. Unlike his eyesight, Mr Nasser’s timing may be immaculate.
