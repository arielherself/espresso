<strong>COP27 </strong>in Egypt finally concluded on Sunday morning, 36 hours late, with delegates agreeing to establish a “[loss and damage](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/03/what-is-climate-loss-and-damage)” fund to help those most affected by rising temperatures—something many thought impossible two weeks ago. That seemed to be broadly welcomed by environmental groups. They were less enthused by timid measures to reduce the use of fossil fuels.

<strong>Malaysia</strong> looks set for a hung parliament, after none of the three big coalitions secured a majority in the country’s general election. A group led by [Anwar Ibrahim](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/11/10/malaysias-grand-old-party-eyes-a-comeback), the opposition leader, won the most seats; he is trying to attract support from enough other MPs to form a government. An alliance that includes Muhyiddin Yassin, a former prime minister, and an Islamic party, fared surprisingly well.

<strong>Elon Musk</strong>, Twitter’s [new boss](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/31/how-will-elon-musk-shape-twitter), said that <strong>Donald Trump’s </strong>account will be reinstated. Mr Musk had launched a poll on the social-media platform asking users whether to allow the former president back onto the site. They narrowly voted “yes”. Mr Trump was banned from Twitter for life in the wake of the Capitol riot in 2021.

<strong>John Ray, </strong>the new CEO of <strong>FTX</strong>, until recently one of the world’s biggest crypto exchanges, said that he is looking to sell or restructure its businesses. Mr Ray took over from [Sam Bankman-Fried](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/11/17/what-sam-bankman-frieds-downfall-means-for-effective-altruism), the exchange’s founder, amid the company’s implosion. The saga has left behind 1m creditors and triggered several investigations. A timeline for the possible completion is not clear.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Ukraine’s</strong> prime minister, [Denys Shmyhal](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/ukraines-prime-minister-says-reconstruction-planning-must-start-now/21808965), said almost half of the country’s power[ grid](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/24/ukraine-races-to-stop-russia-from-destroying-its-power-grid) had been disabled by Russian missile strikes. The attacks have left swathes of Ukraine without <strong>electricity</strong>, just as Kyiv, the capital, had its first snowfall of the season. On Thursday President Volodymyr Zelensky said that 10m Ukrainians had no power.

<strong>FIFA’s</strong> president, Gianni Infantino, called Western critics of the [decision](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/17/in-defence-of-qatars-hosting-of-the-world-cup) to hold the football World Cup in Qatar “hypocrites”. In a lengthy and often bizarre defence of the tournament—“Today I feel gay! Today I feel migrant worker!”—Mr Infantino said Europe should apologise for its own shortcomings before attacking Qatar over its poor treatment of LGBT people and migrant workers.

Kamala Harris, <strong>America’s </strong>vice-president, spoke briefly with Xi Jinping, <strong>China’s </strong>president, at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum meeting in Thailand. Ms Harris said she emphasised the need to keep lines of communication between the countries open. On Monday President Joe Biden met Mr Xi for the [first time](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/11/10/can-joe-biden-and-xi-jinping-stabilise-sino-american-relations) during his presidency.

<strong>Word of the week: </strong><em>kafala</em>, an Arabic word roughly meaning “sponsorship”. Workers under Qatar’s <em>kafala </em>system often have their freedom curtailed.

## What next for Ukraine?

One week on from Ukraine’s liberation of Kherson city, the frontlines of the war are stabilising again. Russia has been building new defensive positions on the left bank of the Dnieper river and moving thousands of troops from Kherson province to shore up its lines elsewhere. Western officials are unsure whether Ukraine has enough left in the tank for another big offensive before the end of the year. If so, it might come in Luhansk, a region in the east where Russia is under sustained pressure around the city of Svatove, or even in Zaporizhia, towards the “land bridge” to Crimea.

Meanwhile Russia, retreating on the ground, is intensifying its war in the air. On Thursday it conducted five air strikes and launched 25 cruise missiles across Ukraine. The campaign is designed to destroy the country’s energy infrastructure and leave Ukrainians [shivering over winter](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/11/01/keeping-ukraine-from-freezing-this-winter). In Kyiv, temperatures have dropped below freezing and the first snow of the season has arrived.

## A “new Kazakhstan”, but politics as usual

Kazakhstan [votes on Sunday](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/11/17/old-politics-in-the-new-kazakhstan) in a presidential election that Kassym-Zhomart Tokayev, the incumbent, is expected to win by a landslide. He called the vote 18 months early to deliver a “radical reset” of the political system, following protests in January that left 238 people dead and threatened Mr Tokayev’s grip on power.

Nursultan Nazarbayev, Mr Tokayev’s predecessor, stamped out political opposition in the Central Asian country. He was routinely re-elected with vote shares of nearly 100%. He stepped down in 2019 with the intention of micromanaging his successor. But Mr Tokayev has distanced himself from the former strongman. Many suspect that Mr Nazarbayev’s cronies stoked the violence in January.

Mr Tokayev now promises to foster multiparty democracy. He says he is building a “new Kazakhstan” but seems to be using Mr Nazarbayev’s playbook. The “opposition” in Sunday’s election consists of five political nobodies who have done nothing to hold Mr Tokayev to account. His re-election is certain. It is very much old-style politics in Mr Tokayev’s new Kazakhstan.

## The World Cup kicks off

Rarely has a global sporting event created as much apprehension as the football World Cup in Qatar. The party, which starts on Sunday when Qatar takes on Ecuador, does not feel festive yet. On Friday officials banned the sale of alcohol in stadiums. Accommodation is still being completed. Fans have arrived, but no one is sure if they are real or paid by the organisers. The timing of the tournament, in the middle of a gruelling European football season, means teams have had little time to prepare.

The stadiums, however, are ready. Built at enormous cost and on the backs of migrant labourers, they will look superb on camera. And though they may be exhausted, the players will be up for it. The World Cup remains the sport’s biggest prize. And when the stars light up the pitch, even the most cynical fans may [forget their misgivings](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/17/in-defence-of-qatars-hosting-of-the-world-cup), which range from concerns over FIFA’s corruption to Qatar’s poor human-rights record.

## Mind (control) where you’re going

For many people, the merging of the human mind and robotic intelligence is more than a pipe dream or science fiction. Those with [spinal-cord injury](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/spinal-implants-allow-paralysed-people-to-walk-swim-and-cycle-again/21807596), for instance, can use technology that connects nerves beneath damaged tissue to the brain, allowing the paralysed to walk again. Now, as reported in the journal <em>iScience</em>, three tetraplegics—people paralysed from the neck down—have learned to use mind-controlled wheelchairs. Special skullcaps sensed their brain waves, which were translated into directions for an intelligent-powered wheelchair.

The commands were simple: concentrate on moving both hands to turn left, and both feet to turn right. As the participants practised, the algorithm improved at interpreting their personal brain patterns. The humans’ brains changed too: their neural connectivity evolved as mind control came more naturally. After several months of training, two of the three tetraplegics could navigate a cluttered room using thought alone.

## Weekend profile: Changpeng Zhao, boss of Binance

The implosion of [FTX](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/09/the-spectacular-fall-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried), until recently a major crypto exchange, has left plenty of people with egg on their faces. But one crypto giant has emerged stronger—at least for now. Binance has cemented its status as the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. And [Changpeng Zhao](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/11/16/who-is-changpeng-zhao-the-chief-executive-of-binance), its 45-year-old co-founder and boss, has triumphed. The crypto crash may have taken its toll on Mr Zhao’s fortune, but he is still worth a cool $17bn. 

Mr Zhao was born in China in 1977. When he was 12 his family, facing repression at home, fled to Canada. But after studying computer science at McGill University in Montreal, Mr Zhao returned to China. In 2015, convinced that bitcoin “would do to finance what the internet would do to information,” he launched Bijie Tech, which offered software to crypto exchanges, in Shanghai. 

China soon shut down all crypto exchanges, but Mr Zhao was undeterred, skirting Chinese restrictions by relocating to various hubs around Asia. In July 2017 he launched his own cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. Today dozens of billions of dollars worth of assets change hands each day on the platform; Binance usually takes a 0.1% fee for its trouble. 

The company has thrived thanks to Mr Zhao’s ruthless decision-making. At the height of the boom in ICOs (initial coin offerings) in 2017, Binance rushed to list the flurry of newly launched cryptocurrencies, as other exchanges dawdled. Earlier this month, after rumours of trouble emerged at FTX, Mr Zhao said that Binance would sell $600m-worth of an FTX token—a move that precipitated his rival’s cash crunch. 

A complete crash across the sector would probably obliterate Mr Zhao’s wealth, most of which [is held](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2021/12/18/the-most-powerful-people-in-crypto) in digital assets. And Binance faces other problems. Critics say Mr Zhao’s taste for “controlled chaos”, his reliance on a small inner circle and his ravenous appetite for growth have led to corner-cutting. The exchange’s history is peppered with damaging hacks and allegations of money-laundering. This week Mr Zhao promised more transparency and said Binance would prove that it has enough liquid assets to face any crisis. Yet as the crypto crash deepens and regulators come sniffing, the digital Teflon Man may not prove resistant to corrosion forever.
