<strong>China</strong> said it would sever talks with America on defence and climate following the [visit](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/08/03/nancy-pelosi-has-left-taiwan-the-real-crisis-may-be-just-beginning) of Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of America’s House of Representatives, to <strong>Taiwan</strong> on Tuesday. On the second day of its most-provocative military drills in decades, which included [live-fired missiles](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/08/04/china-sends-missiles-flying-over-taiwan) over the island, China also sent warships across the Taiwan Strait’s median line on Friday. The White House warned of stumbling into a real conflict.

Three more ships carrying about 58,000 tonnes of <strong>grain</strong> left <strong>Ukrainian</strong> ports under the deal relaxing Russia’s blockade; [the first sailed on Monday](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/08/01/the-first-grain-ship-leaves-odessa-under-a-un-brokered-deal). According to the <em>Financial Times</em>, Ukraine has called for the deal to be expanded to include other products, such as metals. Separately, Britain’s defence ministry said Russian forces occupying the <strong>Zaporizhzhia nuclear-power plant</strong>, [Europe’s largest](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/03/04/europes-largest-nuclear-plant-shuts-down-after-a-russian-attack), appear to have undermined its safety.

Sergei Lavrov, <strong>Russia’s</strong> foreign minister, said that his country was open to a prisoner swap with America in the case of <strong>Brittney Griner</strong>. The [basketball star](http://espresso.economist.com/bc06df8f21ab805ccb2a7d9f396ed918), imprisoned in Russia for the possession of drugs, is likely to be exchanged for a Russian arms dealer, Viktor Bout. America also wants the return of Paul Whelan, a marine jailed for espionage.

<strong>Indonesia’s</strong> GDP growth in the second quarter beat expectations, rising 5.44% from a year earlier. [South-East Asia’s largest economy](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/21/soaring-inflation-is-making-south-east-asians-hungrier-and-poorer) was bolstered by its exports, propped up by high global commodity prices, as well as resurgent consumption.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

The Democrats in America’s Senate cleared a final obstacle on their way to passing an omnibus bill concerning <strong>climate-change, health-care and tax policy</strong>, by pulling their recalcitrant partisan, <strong>Kyrsten Sinema </strong>of Arizona, on side. The other holdout, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, [rejoined the fold](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/28/democratic-hopes-for-a-big-spending-bill-are-revived) last week. [Ms Sinema](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/06/12/kyrsten-sinemas-technicolour-moderation) won a concession to protect financiers from more swingeing taxation, and further relief for her drought-stricken state.

<strong>Viktor Orban</strong>, Hungary’s prime minister, gave the opening speech at <strong>CPAC</strong>, a gathering of mostly American right-wingers, in Texas. Mr Orban’s model of “illiberal democracy”, which includes building a border fence, railing against multiculturalism and banning gender studies, has made him a [darling of the American right](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/04/why-is-the-american-right-obsessed-with-viktor-orban)—and a bogeyman to liberals on both sides of the pond.

<strong>Warner Brothers Discovery </strong>said that it would ditch its “streaming-first” model—the first big withdrawal from the [streaming wars](https://www.economist.com/business/disney-netflix-apple-is-anyone-winning-the-streaming-wars/21807591) being fought between companies such as Netflix, Disney and Apple. The firm—formed in May upon the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery—will ponder free ad-based channels and pursue more licensing of its films. It announced the about-turn as it marked a $3.4bn net loss for the latest quarter.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>$1trn, the amount that the war in Ukraine has taken off forecasts for global GDP in 2022. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/08/04/by-how-much-will-the-war-in-ukraine-reduce-global-growth).

## The sultan and the tsar

Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin meet in Sochi on Friday for their second summit in 17 days. The war in Ukraine has brought Turkey and Russia’s leaders closer, but also shifted the balance of power in their relationship. Mr Putin is more isolated than ever and suffering humiliations on the battlefield. His Turkish counterpart, until recently a pariah in Western capitals, has made himself indispensable by [brokering a deal](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/08/01/the-first-grain-ship-leaves-odessa-under-a-un-brokered-deal) to release Ukrainian and Russian grain exports across the Black Sea.

But Turkey also needs Russia for its money. Mr Erdogan’s government has not joined in Western sanctions, making his country a destination for oligarchs’ superyachts and potentially also for their investments. Last week the Kremlin said it is buying $6.1bn in Turkish treasury bonds as part of a loan deal for the Russian-built Akkuyu nuclear power plant, currently under construction on the Mediterranean coast. The cash will provide a much needed boost to Turkey’s [shrinking foreign currency reserves](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/07/21/how-has-turkeys-economy-kept-growing-despite-raging-inflation).

## America’s job market comes off the boil

Having run hot for 18 months, the labour market in America may at last be softening. Data due on Friday are expected to show that the economy added about 250,000 jobs in July, the fewest since the end of 2020. That would be a solid result: a slowdown in [job creation](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/07/07/labour-markets-in-the-rich-world-are-recovering-from-covid-19) ought to lessen inflationary pressure while avoiding the steep employment losses commonly seen during recessions.

The question is how long this Goldilocks scenario can last. Even with the slight cooling in the labour market, private-sector wages are rising at an annual pace of more than 5%. That is far too fast for the Federal Reserve to succeed in bringing inflation back to its target of roughly 2%. Moreover, the economy has yet to feel the full brunt of the central bank’s recent [interest-rate increases](https://www.economist.com/leaders/the-federal-reserve-is-causing-pain-in-financial-markets/21809132). The still robust job figures in July may thus be a way-station on a path towards more lay-offs.

## The Edinburgh Festival struggles to stay festive

The first Edinburgh International Festival was held in 1947 to rebuild [cultural ties across Europe](https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/07/08/european-folk-festivals-reboot-as-covid-19-ebbs) following the ravages of the second world war. Since then it has prided itself on its cosmopolitanism; in 2019 2,800 artists from over 40 countries performed in classical music, theatre and dance shows.

This year’s edition, which starts on Friday, is fighting to hold up that mantle. The war in Ukraine, chaos in the airline industry and Brexit have created a perfect storm of logistical challenges. There is a shortage of temporary workers, burdensome documentation and visa requirements are holding up European artists and the cost of shipping equipment has rocketed. Many performers are worried about having to cancel at the last minute because of covid-19; audiences, duly wary, are not booking their tickets in advance, depriving shows of cash. In its 75th year, the festival is having to try harder than ever to preserve its international roots.

## Gold loses its lustre

AngloGold Ashanti, the world’s fourth-largest gold producer, wants its results to shine on Friday, as it reports on the changes made by the chief executive appointed in July 2021. But financial markets are unlikely to be impressed. The gold miner’s share price has dropped by 60% from its all-time high in July 2020. Similarly poor returns have been registered by competitors, including America’s Newmont and Canada’s Barrick Gold. That is in part because [gold miners](https://www.economist.com/business/2020/02/06/gold-companies-try-to-restore-their-sparkle) often outperform gold in a rising market, but also sink lower when it is on the way down. The metal’s price has dropped by 14.5% since March.

Historically, bullion has been seen as a safe haven amid inflation—and the shares of its miners as a hedge. This time around, the miners are suffering from higher costs without benefiting from higher prices. Either speculators think inflation is temporary or, for now at least, gold’s historic insurance role is waning.

## India’s economic risks pile up

For months, as other central banks around the world tightened monetary policy, the Reserve Bank of India held firm, wary of jeopardising a fragile economic recovery from the pandemic. In May, however, the RBI sprung into action. It increased interest rates by 0.4 percentage points, and again by 0.5 percentage points in June. The annual inflation rate, at 7% in July, has now exceeded the RBI’s upper threshold of 6% for five consecutive months. On Friday the bank announced another raise of 0.5 percentage points, which pushed rates back to pre-pandemic levels. 

It is not just inflation that the bank is worrying about. The value of the rupee fell to its lowest-ever rate against the dollar in July, forcing the RBI to draw on foreign reserves to prevent further damage. India’s trade deficit has ballooned, too. The RBI need not look far to see the cost of mismanagement. Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka are already in deep economic trouble.
