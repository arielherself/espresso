<strong>American</strong> presidents past and present held competing [rallies](https://www.economist.com/mid-terms-2022) in the swing state of Pennsylvania ahead of Tuesday’s <strong>midterm elections</strong>. Barack Obama and Joe Biden staged a double-act in Philadelphia, where Mr Obama told Democrats that “truth and facts and logic and reason and basic decency are on the ballot”. Meanwhile south-east of Pittsburgh Donald Trump roused Republicans, calling on them to stop the “destruction of our country”.

<strong>Japan’s</strong> prime minister, Kishida Fumio, promised to increase the country’s defence capabilities, saying that it must be ready to protect itself from rising security threats. He cited North Korea’s recent flurry of missile tests and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The message is a sign of [shifting priorities](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/09/13/war-in-ukraine-has-bolstered-japans-support-for-a-stronger-army) in Japan, where pacifism has been a powerful political principle since the second world war. 

<strong>China</strong> reported 4,420 new daily cases of <strong>covid-19</strong>, the highest since May. On Saturday officials reiterated their commitment to a [zero-covid](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/11/03/the-chinese-city-that-covid-forgot) approach, involving strict lockdowns when new outbreaks are detected. Markets had jumped in recent days on the hope that China would relax its covid restrictions, which are dampening [economic growth](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/24/chinas-gdp-is-flagging-where-might-growth-come-from).

The <strong>UN’s</strong> human-rights chief urged <strong>Elon Musk</strong> to ensure that “human rights are central to the management of Twitter”. Reports that the social-media firm’s entire human-rights team had been sacked were not an “encouraging start”, wrote Volker Turk in an open letter. Earlier Mr Musk claimed Twitter had “no choice” but to conduct mass layoffs as the social media platform is [losing $4m per day](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/11/03/will-people-pay-8-a-month-for-twitter).

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Iran’s</strong> Revolutionary Guards launched a new rocket capable of carrying a satellite, according to state television. The country has three satellites in orbit, and claims its programme is peaceful, though Western powers are not so sure. Separately, for the first time Iran admitted to [supplying Russia with drones](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/19/iranian-drones-pose-a-fiendish-military-problem-for-ukraine)—but said the shipments were delivered before the war in Ukraine. An American official said they were sent this past summer.

<strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>, Warren Buffett’s conglomerate, recorded a loss of $2.7bn in the third quarter of 2022 as stocks sagged. That is better than the $43.8bn it lost in the second quarter, though less than its $10.3bn profit a year ago amid a stockmarket boom. Operating earnings, a proxy for the cash generated by the firm’s businesses, rose compared with a year ago to $7.8bn.

A suicide-bomb attack at an army-training camp in Mogadishu, <strong>Somalia’s</strong> capital, left at least 10 dead. <strong>Al-Shabab</strong>, an affiliate of al-Qaeda, [claimed responsibility](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/03/somali-clans-are-revolting-against-jihadists). On Friday the army said it killed 100 al-Shabab fighters in clashes in the central state of Hirshabelle. A week ago al-Shabab killed 116 people in two bomb attacks in Mogadishu.

## Weekend profile: Kari Lake, Arizona’s Republican candidate for governor

The first time she was “cancelled really hard”, as she puts it, Kari Lake did some soul searching. In 2019 a hot mic had caught Ms Lake—then a veteran television newsreader in Phoenix, Arizona—crudely dismissing concerns about her presence on Parler, a right-wing social network. “Fuck them,” she said of her detractors. “They’re 20-year-old dopes.”

After the tape leaked, the dopes called for Ms Lake to be fired. She spent a week off the air, but her unease only grew. She turned to God. She started comparing the Bible she kept on one side of her desk with the news scripts she kept on the other. Eventually, she quit broadcasting altogether, saying she was through with “having to read news that I felt wasn’t fully truthful”. Shortly thereafter she announced her candidacy as a Republican for [governor of Arizona](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/11/01/arizonas-midterm-races-are-full-of-election-deniers), in a video produced by her husband, a videographer with a penchant for soft-focus backgrounds.

Ms Lake enjoys a slight lead over her lacklustre Democratic opponent, Katie Hobbs, ahead of Tuesday’s election. She is revelling in her cancellation. Ms Lake frequently peddles the lie that the 2020 election was stolen, earning Donald Trump’s approval. She describes [immigration on Arizona’s southern border](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/10/04/the-biden-administration-is-quietly-completing-bits-of-donald-trumps-wall) as an “invasion”. She has accused Ms Hobbs of supporting sex education for youngsters and opposing medical care for infants who survive abortion attempts. Both characterisations are misleading. But unlike many of [Mr Trump’s acolytes](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/10/27/why-the-republicans-anti-democracy-turn-has-become-normalised), she is fully media-trained. Glenn Beck, a right-wing radio host, compares her speaking talent to that of Ronald Reagan. Ms Hobbs refuses to debate her—no doubt for fear of getting shown up.

Critics spy opportunism in Ms Lake’s recent political awakening. She says no politician since Reagan has thrilled her like Mr Trump, yet she voted for Barack Obama in 2008. She calls herself Christian from birth, and dismisses rumours that she dabbled in Buddhism. (The yoga was for stress relief, she says.) If she can convince Arizona voters that she is the real deal, the Lake playbook—ultra-smooth delivery of far-right talking points—could be a winner. Democrats are rightly worried.

## Smartphones can assess bridge safety

People like to imagine that bridges are unshakably solid. In reality they are dynamic: vehicles and wind keep them constantly aquiver. Engineers regularly monitor bridges’ structural integrity with expensive sensors. But research published in <em>Communications Engineering</em> shows that crowdsourced data from drivers’ smartphones can detect a bridge’s vibrations just as accurately.

Researchers (and some [Uber](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/10/31/what-went-wrong-with-snap-netflix-and-uber) drivers) drove back and forth across the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco as their phones ran a purpose-built app. In under 100 crossings, the app was able to tune out traffic noise and isolate the bridge’s vibrational frequencies. The crowdsourced data was nearly identical to that from conventional sensors placed along the bridge. The same held true for tests on a shorter concrete roadbridge. The engineers estimate that this practice could add up to 15 years to a bridge’s life. No bridge lasts for ever, but constant, cheap data is the key to preventive maintenance.

## Corruption at FIFA

Of the 22 men on FIFA’s Executive Committee in 2010 who voted to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 edition to Qatar, more than half of them have been accused, indicted or convicted of corruption, according to Nick Harris, a journalist. For years football’s global governing body was a rotten organisation, more concerned with feathering the nests of its leaders than promoting the game around the world.

But in recent years investigative journalists and law enforcement officials have been applying more scrutiny. The reckoning for a generation of football administrators, most notably Sepp Blatter, who was FIFA’s president for 17 years, is the subject of a new Netflix documentary, “FIFA Uncovered”, released next week. The [World Cup in Qatar](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/02/qatar-races-to-ready-itself-for-an-unusual-world-cup), which starts in a fortnight, will be an exercise in damage limitation for FIFA, before it can turn its attention to the 2026 event. Co-hosted by America, Canada and Mexico, that tournament has so far escaped the whiff of corruption.

## Australia’s reckoning with racism

The list of crimes perpetrated against [Australia’s Aboriginals](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/08/11/australias-leader-wants-to-include-aboriginals-in-the-constitution), who make up about 4% of the population, is long and grim. Even by those standards, the death of Cassius Turvey shocked the country. On October 13th the 15-year-old was walking home from school in Perth, in Western Australia, when he was chased down and assaulted with a metal pole. He died of his injuries ten days later. Police have charged Jack Brearley, a white 21-year-old, with murder. Mr Brearley will appear in court on November 9th.

Aboriginals are aghast. Thousands have gathered in vigils this week calling for an end to racism against their people. Yet police warn against “unfounded speculation” that could prejudice a jury and jeopardise the trial. They say there is nothing to indicate yet that there was a racial motive, suggesting it could be a case of mistaken identity. To Aboriginals, that is tin-eared—and proof that authorities remain indifferent to their plight.

## COP27 kicks off

On Sunday the United Nations’ annual climate summit began. Delegates are massed in Sharm el-Sheikh, an Egyptian resort town on the Red Sea, for the event, which runs for two weeks. Politicians will make lofty public promises about reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. Behind closed doors, meanwhile, negotiators will squabble about how to do it—and who should pay.

At last year’s summit, in Glasgow, nearly 200 countries recommitted themselves to the Paris Agreement target of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C over pre-industrial levels by 2100. That goal already appears practically [out of reach](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/03/the-world-is-missing-its-lofty-climate-targets-time-for-some-realism). Countries have failed to adequately slash emissions, which are still rising globally. The consequences of this will be catastrophic, and every effort should be made to ensure [as little warming as possible](https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2022/11/05/the-world-is-going-to-miss-the-totemic-1-5c-climate-target). But there also must be an enhanced commitment to [adaptation](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2022-11-05), including poor countries’ calls for funding for [the damages they have already incurred](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/03/what-is-climate-loss-and-damage). The clock has already ticked too far.
