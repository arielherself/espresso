<strong>America’s</strong> core consumer-price index, a measure of <strong>inflation</strong> excluding food and energy costs, rose by [just 0.2%](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/13/americas-inflation-fever-may-be-breaking-at-last) in November, its second straight month at a subdued level. On Wednesday the Federal Reserve is expected to <strong>raise interest rates </strong>by just 0.5 percentage points, after four consecutive rises of 0.75 percentage points each. Markets in Europe and America surged on the news.

The Biden administration is readying a plan to send American <strong>Patriot air-defence missiles</strong> to <strong>Ukraine</strong>, according to reports. President Volodymyr Zelensky has long coveted the top-of-the-range system, but his calls have become more urgent with Russia’s aerial campaign against [Ukraine’s energy infrastructure](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/11/01/keeping-ukraine-from-freezing-this-winter); loud explosions echoed through central Kyiv on Wednesday morning. Each Patriot battery [costs](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/11/how-the-west-is-helping-ukraine-beat-russias-missiles) upwards of $1bn, and requires at least 70 soldiers with months of training to operate.

<strong>Four migrants</strong> died attempting the short but dangerous journey across the [English Channel](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/12/01/can-britain-stop-migrants-crossing-the-channel). Another 43 people were saved, mostly pulled out from the freezing waters. The accident comes a day after Britain’s prime minister, <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong>, promised to boost staffing to deal with a growing backlog of asylum claims. More than 40,000 people have set out to cross the channel in [small boats](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/11/02/why-small-boats-are-a-big-problem-for-britain) so far this year.

<strong>Mikheil Saakashvili</strong>, the jailed former president of Georgia, renewed his [hunger strike](https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/11/18/near-death-in-jail-georgias-former-president-defies-its-current-one) in protest over his treatment. He was imprisoned last October on charges of abusing office before being moved to a clinic in May after his health deteriorated. Technical glitches reportedly prevented Mr Saakashvili from joining a hearing on Wednesday via videolink. The court adjourned until December 22nd.

<strong>China </strong>promised second booster jabs to those most vulnerable to <strong>covid-19</strong>, such as the elderly<em>. </em>The government [has abandoned](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/12/13/how-chinese-people-are-dealing-with-the-spread-of-covid-19) its <strong>zero-covid</strong> stance in order to stabilise the economy (and, probably, because of an [unprecedented wave of protests](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/12/01/xi-jinpings-zero-covid-policy-has-turned-a-health-crisis-into-a-political-one) against it). The national health commission also said it will no longer track asymptomatic infections. Medical staff in Beijing were ordered to work even if infected. 

<strong>Paytm</strong>, India’s leading [digital-wallet platform](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/06/08/indians-are-switching-to-digital-payments-in-droves), will buy back up to $103m worth of shares in a bid to calm markets. The Softbank-backed company went public in India’s biggest ever stock-market listing in November 2021. But investors felt the loss-making startup was overvalued; its share price has since dropped by three-quarters. Its boss, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, said that “healthy revenues” remained possible.

Polls closed in <strong>Fiji </strong>in an election pitting Frank Bainimarama, the incumbent prime minister who led a coup in 2006, against Sitiveni Rabuka, who staged one in 1987. Mr Bainimarama’s Fiji First party [won elections](https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/11/17/fijis-coup-makers-act-democratic) in 2014 and 2018 but faces a tight race against Mr Rabuka’s opposition coalition. Fiji’s economy is still reeling from the [damage done to its tourism industry](https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/10/23/restarting-asian-tourism-will-be-harder-than-shutting-it-down) during the pandemic.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>70%, the share of electricity generation in France produced by nuclear reactors, the highest in the world. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/12/12/can-the-french-nuclear-industry-avoid-meltdown).

## The Fed downshifts to a slower rate rise

Wednesday will probably mark the start of a new phase in the Federal Reserve’s battle against inflation. After four consecutive [interest-rate increases](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/02/the-fed-delivers-another-jumbo-rate-rise-and-its-far-from-done) of 0.75 percentage points, America’s central bank is likely to opt for half a point at its December meeting. 

In part that will reflect the Fed’s confidence that [inflation is easing](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/07/inflation-is-falling-but-not-enough). Data released on Tuesday showed the core consumer-price index rose by just 0.2% in November. But there are two crucial caveats. First, it takes a long time for rate changes to filter through the economy. The combined impact of the past year’s tightening will only show up next year. The risk of a recession will grow even as rate increases get smaller.

Second, the Fed has been at pains to insist that it will keep rates elevated for as long as is needed to bring inflation to heel. A slowdown in rate increases does not equate to an easing of monetary policy.

## A crackdown in Bangladesh

On Wednesday Bangladesh will mark the anniversary of the murder, by a militia controlled by the Pakistani army, of intellectuals just before the end of the war of independence in 1971. The shadow of that [conflict](https://www.economist.com/1843/2017/03/28/virtual-revenge-is-sweet-in-bangladesh) looms large in Bangladesh. The prime minister, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, whose party, the Awami League, led the independence struggle, faces demands from the opposition for her resignation. She in turn accuses the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party of favouring Pakistan. 

The real issues, claims the BNP, are the poor state of the economy and Sheikh Hasina’s authoritarian tendencies. In recent weeks the party has been holding massive protests, capitalising on public anger about slowing economic growth and surging inflation. It regards the conviction and jailing on corruption charges of its leader, [​​Khaleda Zia](https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/02/08/the-conviction-of-khaleda-zia-hobbles-bangladeshs-opposition), a former prime minister, as political persecution. 

The government has cracked down hard on the protests. Several thousand BNP activists have been arrested, many on charges of inciting violence. Elections are not due until January 2024. There is no sign that tensions will ease before then.

## Better news for Germany’s economy

On Wednesday the Ifo Institute, a think-tank in Munich, published its quarterly economic forecast for Germany. It was less gloomy than the last one, published in September. The institute suggested that an impending recession will be less severe than it had previously expected. The Ifo now forecasts that the German economy will contract by 0.1% in 2023, compared with earlier forecast of a 0.3% decline. In a separate survey conducted in November, Ifo found that business confidence has been buoyed as Germany filled all of its storage facilities for [natural gas](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/12/01/meet-the-man-who-may-decide-the-fate-of-german-industry), even though no Russian gas has arrived since September, easing panic about soaring energy costs. 

The rate of inflation may have already peaked which should mean that, after a steep fall, households’ real incomes can rise again. Germany’s politicians will hope that increased consumer spending will provide the motor of recovery in the second half of next year. But they cannot be [complacent](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/13/europe-is-growing-complacent-about-its-energy-crisis). Energy shortages, and high prices, could return [next winter](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/29/europes-next-energy-crunch). 

## Travel operators hope for a happier 2023

As Europe shivers through a cold snap, travel operators will hope that winter-weary consumers book big plans for next summer. After three years of pandemic restrictions and [labour shortages](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/07/travel-chaos-in-europe-is-a-glimpse-of-a-future-with-few-spare-workers), the industry is trying to return to normal. An early sign of progress came on Wednesday, when TUI, a German travel operator, reported its latest results. The firm announced its first quarterly profit since the [start of the pandemic](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/14/take-that-covid-revenge-tourism-takes-off), with guest numbers back to 93% of pre-pandemic levels over the summer.

TUI says it is “optimistic” about the year ahead, noting that early bookings for next summer are up on last year. But [high inflation](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/31/europe-is-heading-for-recession-how-bad-will-it-be) and rising interest rates mean less spending money, and could yet stem the flow of bookings. And a group of more than 500 British holidaymakers are suing the company after an outbreak of gastric illness spoiled their summer get-aways this year. Uncertainty still clouds the skies.

## One step closer to controlled fusion power

America’s energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, announced on Tuesday that the country’s National Ignition Facility (NIF) had lived up to the “I” in its name, by [achieving ignition](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/12/13/controlled-fusion-power-is-little-nearer-now-than-it-was-a-week-ago). 

The stuff ignited was some pellets of a frozen mixture of deuterium and tritium—isotopes of hydrogen. “Ignition” means that NIF, which creates fusion in such pellets by bombarding them simultaneously with 192 laser beams, had started a reaction which released more energy than was put into the pellet by the beams. 

Ms Granholm made a great fuss about that. But the huge amount of energy required to generate the beams in the first place (which did not form part of the headline calculation) means this approach is not even close to yielding a route to civil fusion power. Since NIF’s main job is military (the understanding of hydrogen bombs) that does not directly matter. But if civil fusion does come about, it is unlikely to be done in this way.
