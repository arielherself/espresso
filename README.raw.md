A <strong>Palestinian</strong> gunman shot at least seven people dead at a synagogue in east <strong>Jerusalem</strong>. The shooter was killed by the police. Forty-two people were later arrested, including members of the gunman’s family. On Thursday <strong>Israeli</strong> troops killed nine Palestinians during a [military raid](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/05/14/shireen-abu-aqleh-was-killed-covering-an-israeli-raid) on Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the deadliest raid in the camp in years. Israeli forces said they were targeting Islamist militants.

The Memphis Police Department released four videos of <strong>Tyre Nichols</strong>, a black man, being beaten by officers during a traffic stop on January 7th. Mr Nichols died from his injuries three days later. The five officers involved have been fired and charged with second-degree murder. Protests have taken place in the Tennessee city and several others around America.

David Solomon, chief executive of <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, received $25m in compensation last year, down by nearly 30% from 2021. His pay cut came amid [stumbles by the investment bank](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/01/26/the-humbling-of-goldman-sachs), including an ill-fated foray into consumer lending, and a dealmaking drought that has hit profits. The bosses of JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley each made north of $30m last year.

More than $50bn was wiped from the value of <strong>Gautam Adani’s</strong> conglomerate days after Hindenburg Research, a short-seller, [accused it of fraud](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/27/a-short-seller-rattles-gautam-adanis-empire). The share price of Adani Enterprises—the flagship in the empire of India’s richest man—plunged by 17%. Nevertheless the firm proceeded with a share auction, in which it aims to raise $2.5bn. It called Hindenburg’s report “maliciously mischievous”.

The second round of the <strong>Czech Republic’s</strong> presidential election entered its second and final day on Saturday. Voters must choose either Andrej Babis, an oligarch and former prime minister, or Petr Pavel, a retired general, as their largely ceremonial head of state. A [first round](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/01/17/the-next-czech-president-will-be-a-trumpish-oligarch-or-a-general), held between eight candidates on January 13th and 14th, failed to produce a clear winner.

<strong>Peru’s</strong> congress refused to bring the country’s presidential elections forward to December 2023, despite a plea from the incumbent, Dina Boluarte. Peru has been [gripped by almost daily protests](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/01/19/perus-political-chaos-looks-likely-to-persist) demanding her resignation since she took office after a bungled coup attempt by her predecessor, Pedro Castillo, in early December. Forty-seven people have been killed in clashes between demonstrators and security forces.

<strong>Ukrainian soldiers</strong> arrived in <strong>Germany</strong> and will soon start training on 40 Marder fighting vehicles pledged to Ukraine. The preparation begins days after Olaf Scholz, Germany’s chancellor, promised—after much dithering—to send German-made [Leopard 2 tanks](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/01/25/what-makes-germanys-leopard-2-tank-the-best-fit-for-ukraine) to fight Russia. The West has stepped up its [military support](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/01/25/nato-members-are-right-to-send-tanks-to-ukraine) for Ukraine in anticipation of an upcoming Russian offensive.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 775,014, the number of cars that emerged from British factories in 2022, the worst year since 1956. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/01/24/britains-carmaking-industry-is-increasingly-under-threat).

## Disney marks its centenary

The happiest place on earth will be even jollier on Friday, as celebrations begin at Disneyland for the company’s [100th birthday](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/01/19/as-disney-turns-100-its-business-is-on-a-rollercoaster-ride). Disney’s first century has been a triumph: today the studio rules the worldwide box office, it has more streaming subscriptions than any of its competitors, and its theme parks are once again bustling now lockdowns have been lifted.

But its boardroom is less cheery. Fewer people watch films in the cinema and cable-TV, Disney’s main source of profit, is being replaced by streaming. Plus, despite all those subscribers to its streaming service, Disney is losing more than $1bn a quarter. In November the company fired its chief executive. His replacement, [Bob Iger](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/21/disney-brings-back-a-star-of-the-past-but-its-real-problem-is-the-script), now faces a challenge from Nelson Peltz, an activist investor who wants a board seat. Mr Iger, who previously ran Disney from 2005 to 2020, has been given two years to steady the ship and find a successor. Disney’s second century is starting with a bumpy ride.

## A Modi documentary reverberates in India

In recent days India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and its leader Narendra Modi have provided a textbook example of the [Streisand effect](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2013/04/15/what-is-the-streisand-effect). That occurs when attempts to suppress something—in this case a controversial documentary—draw more attention to it. When “The Modi Question”, a BBC production, aired last week, the BJP immediately dismissed it as a “propaganda piece” for its account of the riots that killed more than 1,000 people, mainly Muslims, in Gujarat when Mr Modi was the state’s chief minister in 2002. The [Hindu nationalist party](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/28/indias-hindu-nationalist-ruling-party-preaches-social-inclusion) then invoked an emergency law to ban the video on the internet.

Twitter and YouTube have complied by taking down videos, but clips continue to proliferate on social-media channels. Activists and students have planned more screenings, even though some have been arrested. Media watchdogs have condemned the BJP’s heavy-handed response, which raises more questions about the commitment to democracy of the party and its leader.

## The race for the Republican Party executive

On Friday the Republican National Committee chose its chair, who is responsible for fundraising and party messaging. The election was preceded by two days of old-fashioned politicking at the lavish waterfront Waldorf Astoria hotel in Dana Point, California. For the first time since 2013, the race was contested. The incumbent, Ronna McDaniel, faced a stiff challenge from Harmeet Dhillon, a conservative lawyer, before ultimately winning her fourth-term bid.

The contest emboldened Ms McDaniel’s detractors. Mike Lindell, a conspiracy theory-oriented businessman who also ran, has counted the “failures” of her leadership: the 2018 midterm elections, when Republicans lost the House of Representatives; the 2020 presidential election; the [2022 midterms](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/09/the-democrats-have-done-better-than-expected); and two [run-off](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/01/09/two-stunning-victories-for-democrats-in-georgia-upend-the-senate) Senate races. Ms McDaniel’s [ties to Donald Trump](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/08/18/donald-trumps-hold-on-the-republican-party-is-unquestionable) have alienated Never-Trumpers, while more insurgent types called for an organisational overhaul. But at a moment when the word “Republican” frequently precedes “division”, her message—of “unity and certainty”—proved sufficient to get her over the line.

## Fighting femicides in Spain

On Friday Spanish government officials met domestic-violence experts to discuss a worrying increase in [femicides](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2020/03/05/why-latin-america-treats-femicides-differently-from-other-murders)—murders of women because of their sex. There have been six in January, as well as the killing of an eight-year-old girl, following 11 in December. (Since records began in 2003, the annual average has been 59.) The government is reportedly considering allowing authorities to inform abused women if their partners have previous convictions for violent crimes.

The country has made strides to protect women since 2016, when a court ruled that a woman’s lack of physical resistance to the five men who raped her meant that the crime was not violent and therefore merely “sexual abuse” (the Supreme Court later [found the men](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/01/spain-acts-to-protect-women) guilty of rape). In 2020 the country recorded proportionately fewer cases of femicide than several of its neighbours, including France and Germany. And unlike other countries, Spain counts any murder of a woman by a man, where gender is deemed to have played a role, as femicide.

## The 1619 Project sparks more debate

The culture wars are coming to Hulu. In 2019, the <em>New York Times </em>magazine released a controversial set of essays that put slavery and the [black American experience](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/07/10/americas-history-wars) at the centre of the country’s founding and development. The 1619 Project divided opinion: it won a Pulitzer prize for commentary in 2020 while being denounced by some historians for factual inaccuracies. Several school districts, such as Chicago, embraced it as a curriculum for pupils; elsewhere whole states, such as Florida, have banned it, favouring more traditional views of American history.

Now the controversy will be streamed in a six-part series produced by Oprah Winfrey and Nikole Hannah-Jones, the project’s creator, among others. Each episode adapts an essay from the collection to show how slavery impacts the present day. So far reviews have been mixed. Some praise it as innovative; others say it falls short of some more original documentaries about the black experience.
