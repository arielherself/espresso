<strong>Russia’s </strong>strikes on [Ukrainian infrastructure](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/24/ukraine-races-to-stop-russia-from-destroying-its-power-grid) caused mass blackouts, and obliged officials to remove three nuclear power plants from the national grid as a precautionary measure. The western city of Lviv was left “without light” and had “interruptions” to its water supply, according to its mayor. Rockets killed three people in Kyiv, the capital. Meanwhile, <strong>Moldova</strong>, which borders <strong>Ukraine</strong> to the east, also experienced a “massive” outage that left over half of the country without power, according to its government. 

A “substantial majority” of <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> policymakers said it would be appropriate to slow the pace of monetary tightening, according to minutes released on Wednesday from their meeting earlier this month. Investors foresee interest rates rising by half a percentage point when America’s central bank meets in December, following four consecutive [three-quarter-point increases](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/02/the-fed-delivers-another-jumbo-rate-rise-and-its-far-from-done).

Leaders from the <strong>Democratic Republic of Congo</strong>, Rwanda and several other African countries agreed to a <strong>ceasefire</strong> starting on Friday in [eastern Congo](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/29/congo-says-martial-law-has-brought-calm-yet-violence-is-rising), following a spate of attacks by the M23 rebel group. Troops from Kenya, Uganda and elsewhere in east Africa will enforce the deal. Congo accuses Rwanda of supporting M23, and recently expelled the Rwandan ambassador.

<strong>Georgia’s</strong> supreme court reinstated a ban on<strong> abortion</strong> at about six weeks’ gestation—before many women even know that they are pregnant. Thirteen states have outlawed the procedure in nearly all instances since<em> Roe v Wade</em> was overturned. And yet Americans are not particularly keen on such restrictions: abortion-rights supporters [won several victories](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/11/where-abortion-was-on-the-ballot-americans-voted-to-protect-it) at the midterms.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

Judges from Britain’s Supreme Court ruled that <strong>Scotland’s</strong> devolved parliament cannot pass a law calling for a referendum on independence without the approval of Britain’s government. Scotland’s first minister, [Nicola Sturgeon](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/nicola-sturgeon-on-the-push-for-another-scottish-referendum), argues that the result of a referendum in 2014, in which Scots rejected independence, is out of date. But the government in Westminster does not want another vote. 

<strong>International tourism </strong>will reach 65% of pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022, according to the World Tourism Organisation, a UN agency. The lifting of covid-19 restrictions led to a [holiday boom](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/14/take-that-covid-revenge-tourism-takes-off) this year, with over double the number of foreign trips between January and September compared with the same period [in 2021](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/12/01/this-year-may-prove-even-worse-for-the-tourism-industry-than-2020). A gloomy global economic outlook may yet weaken the industry’s recovery. 

Twin <strong>bomb attacks</strong> on <strong>Jerusalem’s</strong> bus network during rush hour killed one and injured at least 18 people. Israeli police blamed the explosions on [Palestinian militants](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/05/20/how-israel-and-hamas-returned-to-armed-conflict), though no group has yet claimed responsibility. The blasts, which are the first bomb attacks on Israeli civilians since 2016 according to local police, follow months of heightened [Israeli-Palestinian tensions](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/05/18/the-israel-palestine-conflict-has-claimed-14000-lives-since-1987).

## Turkey threatens to march into Syria

“We have been bearing down on terrorists for a few days with our planes, cannons and guns,” declared Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday. Tanks and soldiers, Turkey’s president added, would follow. Mr Erdogan has been threatening for months a military operation in northern Syria. Last year parliament extended by two years the government’s mandate to move troops into Iraq and Syria. But Mr Erdogan’s argument for a ground incursion has been growing louder since November 13th, when a bomb attack in Istanbul began a deadly tit-for-tat.

Turkey blamed the bomb on the [Kurdistan Workers’ Party](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/06/28/what-is-the-pkk), a rebel group fighting for Kurdish self-rule within Turkey. The group denied that claim. On Sunday Turkish rockets rained down on Kurdish militants in Iraq and Syria; a retaliatory strike on Monday killed two Turkish citizens in Gaziantep, a province adjacent to Syria. Although tensions are rising, the West has been loth to restrain Mr Erdogan, who has become a helpful go-between in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

## Credit Suisse refills its coffers

On Wednesday Credit Suisse warned that it was expecting a loss in its fourth quarter of up to SFr1.5bn ($1.58bn) before tax. Yet another loss lends more urgency to the embattled Swiss bank’s request to shareholders, expected later in the day, to raise more capital for an ambitious restructuring plan it announced in late October. Ravaged by scandals, [Credit Suisse](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/03/credit-suisse-and-the-hunt-for-the-weakest-link-in-global-finance) needs at least SFr4bn ($4.2bn) from investors to pad its balance-sheet. The Saudi National Bank is expected to buy a 9.9% stake, worth SFr1.5bn. That would make it the Swiss bank’s biggest shareholder.

In its new incarnation Credit Suisse plans to focus on international wealth management, as well as its domestic bank and asset-management division. [Investment banking](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/28/investment-banks-are-sharpening-the-axe) will be radically downsized to reduce risk, with Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment-banking arm of Credit Suisse, spun off. It will also let go of its securitised products business, as well as of around 9,000 of its 52,000 employees.

## A legal barrier to Scottish independence

October 19th 2023 might have been the date that Britain broke up. But that fate was averted on Wednesday by a ruling from the Supreme Court. Britain’s highest arbiter ruled that Scotland’s devolved parliament, in Edinburgh, may not pass a law calling for an independence referendum. That power, it concluded, belongs to the British parliament in Westminster alone, which the Conservative Party, which strongly opposes independence, dominates.

The ruling clears up a vital ambiguity in Britain’s constitution, and blocks the road to Scotland’s separatist government led by Nicola Sturgeon from single-handedly pursuing a break-up. It leaves the independence movement in [deadlock](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/03/05/the-fight-over-scottish-independence-appears-to-be-deadlocked). But the polarisation that afflicts Scottish society will continue. In a vote in 2014, held with the [approval](https://www.economist.com/britain/2012/01/14/if-at-first-you-dont-succeed) of David Cameron’s government, Scots rejected independence by 55% to 45%. These days they are firmly split down the middle—and today’s judgement will do little to heal that.

## Russia’s security club hobbles on

The [Collective Security Treaty Organisation](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/01/06/what-is-the-collective-security-treaty-organisation) (CSTO), a supposed military alliance between Russia and five ex-Soviet countries—Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan—began the year with a show of strength. In January Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Kazakhstan’s president, invoked the organisation’s collective-security clause to deal with [anti-government protests](https://www.economist.com/asia/kazakhstans-president-vows-to-cling-on-despite-nationwide-protests/21807017). Within hours the Russian army came to his aid. But as CSTO leaders convened in Armenia on Wednesday to discuss regional security, Nikol Pashinyan, the hosting prime minister, criticised the organisation for its lack of help.

Russia, which keeps its troops in CSTO countries as part of the security pact, has been overstretched by its war in Ukraine. Family feuds have also hobbled the organisation. Last month, amid a simmering border conflict between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, “Indestructible Brotherhood-2022” a joint military operation, was called off. In September [Armenia](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/13/why-azerbaijan-and-armenia-are-fighting-again) asked the organisation for weapons to fend off an attack from its bitter foe Azerbaijan, but the CSTO was able to muster only a fact-finding mission. That may be the best the club’s members can hope for.

## Steven Spielberg’s origin story

What makes a superstar film-maker? Steven Spielberg offers a moving answer in “The Fabelmans,” a thinly disguised account of his upbringing that is released across America on Wednesday. Raised by a computer-engineer father (Paul Dano) and piano-playing mother (Michelle Williams), Samuel Fabelman is left shaken after he sees the climactic train crash in Cecil B. DeMille’s “The Greatest Show on Earth” (1952). Sammy (Gabriel LaBelle) spends the rest of his life trying to recreate that sense of awe by making his own moving images.

The director of “E.T.”, “Jaws” and most recently “[West Side Story](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/01/22/west-side-story-and-the-magic-of-remakes)” is America’s best-known conjuror of cinematic fantasy; it is not easy to picture his origins in quotidian reality. But Mr Spielberg paints a detailed, emotionally intelligent portrait of his postwar Jewish suburban family—loving, yet gradually fractured by parental conflict—and avoids the amber-tinged nostalgia of much boomer-era biography. Funny and wise, the film is one by a consummate showman slowing down to reflect.
