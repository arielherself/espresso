The race for a <strong>Senate</strong> seat in <strong>Georgia</strong> will go to a run-off next month, meaning that control of Congress’s upper chamber may not be known for weeks. To keep the Senate, Democrats [need to win](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/09/the-democrats-have-done-better-than-expected) two of the three competitive seats yet to be called. (They are Arizona, Georgia and Nevada.) The House of Representatives looks likely to flip to the Republicans, but the “red wave” failed to materialise in America’s <strong>midterms</strong>. Separately, abortion-rights supporters scored victories in five states, most notably in conservative Kentucky.

Stockmarkets and <strong>crypto</strong> prices dropped after <strong>Binance</strong>, the world’s largest crypto exchange, withdrew from talks to save <strong>FTX</strong>, its floundering rival. Binance said a [liquidity crunch](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/09/the-spectacular-fall-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried) at FTX was “beyond our control or ability to help” and abruptly withdrew a tentative purchase offer. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reported that FTX needs to cover $8bn in withdrawal requests. The S&amp;P 500 shed 2.1%.

<strong>Russia’s</strong> defence minister and top general ordered troops to withdraw from the Ukrainian city of <strong>Kherson</strong>, the only regional capital Russia had captured since it invaded the country. Ukrainian forces have been making advances in [Kherson province](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/27/russia-braces-for-a-battle-over-kherson) for months. On Wednesday troops pushed closer to the city; Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said there had been “intense fighting” on the frontline.

<strong>Meta</strong>, the parent company of Facebook, announced a plan to make 11,000 employees (13% of its workforce) [redundant](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/11/07/meta-will-lay-off-13-of-its-workforce). The company’s value has dropped by 73% this year. In a letter to employees [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/10/16/how-much-trouble-is-mark-zuckerberg-in), the founder and chief executive, explained that revenue growth during the pandemic had not endured as he had expected. Meta will now focus on “growth areas” including its AI discovery engine, advertising and business platforms and the metaverse.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

The <strong>European Commission </strong>proposed changing the EU’s [fiscal rulebook](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/29/europes-plans-for-laxer-spending-rules-shows-german-influence-is-waning) to allow governments to individually negotiate their debt-reduction plans. Under current rules, countries are obliged to reduce excessive public debt at a standardised rate. If approved, the change could spare heavily indebted countries, like Italy, from unrealistic austerity measures. But less indebted countries, like Germany, worry that more flexibility will be exploited by spendthrift governments.

<strong>European</strong> <strong>Union</strong> negotiators agreed to a law setting stricter <strong>emissions-reduction targets</strong> for sectors not covered by the bloc’s [emissions-trading system](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/05/26/carbon-markets-are-going-global). The deal, struck late on Tuesday night, affects various industries including road transport and agriculture. Meanwhile in Egypt the first demonstrations took place at <strong>COP27</strong>, the UN’s climate summit, with activists calling for an end to funding for fossil fuels.

The <strong>International Monetary Fund</strong> provisionally agreed to a $4.5bn programme to support <strong>Bangladesh’s</strong> struggling economy. Bangladesh has seen [rapid economic growth](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/03/27/bangladeshs-growth-has-been-remarkable-but-is-now-at-risk) in recent years, but has been hit by soaring inflation and lower demand for its garment exports. It is the third country in South Asia to have reached such an agreement with the IMF this year, after Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>40%, the share of Ukraine’s energy infrastructure damaged by Russian missiles and “kamikaze” drones over the past month. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/11/06/western-air-defence-systems-help-ukraine-shoot-down-more-missiles).

## The costs of China’s zero-covid policy

Financial markets are rife with speculation about when the Chinese government might relax its strict [zero-covid policy](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/10/13/china-shows-few-signs-of-loosening-its-zero-covid-policy). One social-media message highlighting the rumours has been dubbed the “trillion-dollar tweet”, after it helped inspire a big rally in Chinese shares.   
  
 But even as investors contemplate a loosening of fetters in the future, China’s economy must endure them in the present. Official figures released on November 15th will probably show that retail sales shrank in nominal terms in October, compared with a year earlier. The growth of industrial production probably slowed, too. And figures released on Wednesday revealed that consumer-price inflation has softened. 

This domestic weakness is all the more troubling because foreign demand for China’s goods is also faltering. The country’s exports shrank last month in dollar terms. When China eventually relaxes its zero-covid policy, it will be opening up to a global economy retreating into its shell.

## The Democrats exceed expectations

As [results ](https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-midterms-2022/results/senate)come in from America’s midterm elections, control of the Senate hangs in the balance. That is already a victory of sorts for Democrats. Though the party [looks likely ](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/07/why-a-republican-ripple-is-more-likely-than-a-red-wave) to lose its majority in the House, the fact that Democratic candidates have done well in seats like Virginia’s 7th district suggests that the job of the next Republican Speaker of the House will become much harder. 

Normally in midterms the president’s party does badly. With inflation above 8% and President Joe Biden’s approval ratings sinking, it seemed a reasonable bet that Democrats would lose at least one Senate seat (and with it their narrow edge in the upper house). If Democrats do hold the Senate, that ought to damage Donald Trump. The former president’s endorsements saddled [Republicans](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/11/09/a-disappointing-showing-for-the-republicans-in-the-midterms) with poor candidates in states like Pennsylvania and Georgia. The evidence that he is, in fact, a serial loser would grow stronger.

## France’s new defence review

Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, will be winched from a helicopter on to an attack submarine near the port of Toulon on Wednesday, after making a speech unveiling a national strategic review. The review, drafted after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, will underline continuity in France’s approach to defence, including its ambition to strengthen “European strategic autonomy” in ways that are complementary to NATO, and its hopes of acting as what Mr Macron calls a “balancing power”. 

The speech will include some novelties nonetheless. Mr Macron will announce the official end of [Operation Barkhane](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/02/14/what-have-french-forces-achieved-in-the-sahel), a French counter-terrorism effort in the north African Sahel. He will add “influence” to a list of the country’s national strategic functions, with the aim of combatting disinformation and asserting France’s interests. The annual budget for the armed forces in 2023 will increase by 7.4% to €43.9bn ($44.2bn). And Mr Macron will stress the need for increased national “resilience”—from robust armed forces to industrial preparedness—to face the risk of further high-intensity warfare in Europe.

## A new chief justice in India

On Wednesday Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud was appointed the 50th chief justice of the Indian Supreme Court. As one of the court’s more liberal judges Mr Chandrachud has been instrumental in its most progressive decisions in recent years, including judgments that enshrined privacy as a fundamental right and [decriminalised homosexuality](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/09/12/how-india-decriminalised-homosexuality).  
  
 Now, as “master of the roster”, Mr Chandrachud will decide when cases are heard and which of the court’s 28 judges will hear them. With nearly 70,000 cases pending, and just two years before he must retire at 65, he will have plenty to do. But his bigger challenge will be managing India’s increasingly muscular government.  
  
 Many Indians hope Mr Chandrachud can make the court a more effective counterweight to the [Hindu-nationalist excesses](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/09/29/indias-government-is-exporting-its-hindu-nationalism) of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, led by the prime minister, Narendra Modi. They will find out soon enough. Upcoming cases include controversial ones about the [status of Kashmir](https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/08/08/india-abruptly-ends-the-last-special-protection-enjoyed-by-kashmir) and a [citizenship law](https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/12/12/indias-new-citizenship-law-outrages-muslims) that many regard as discriminatory against Muslims.

## “The Crown” is back

The fifth season of “The Crown”, a[ television series](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/09/15/the-crown-will-help-shape-the-memory-of-queen-elizabeth-ii) about the British royal family, is released on Netflix on Wednesday. It begins in the early 1990s. John Major (Jonny Lee Miller) is prime minister and Queen Elizabeth II (Imelda Staunton), in her 60s, stands accused by the press of trying to hoard power. Public support for Prince Charles (Dominic West) and his wife, Diana (Elizabeth Debicki), is high, and the heir is jostling for a bigger role.

Now that he has [finally ascended to the throne](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/15/what-sort-of-king-will-charles-iii-be), the timing of the series for King Charles III is awkward. Britons optimistic about their new king could have their minds changed by its portrayal of his scheming and the breakdown of his marriage. The programme prompted criticism even before its release. Sir John (as he is now) suggested it was disrespectful to air it so soon after the queen’s death in September, and dismissed some depictions as “malicious nonsense”. In response Netflix issued a disclaimer reminding audiences that the show is a “fictional dramatisation”.
