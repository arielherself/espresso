<strong>Ukraine’s</strong> <strong>national energy company</strong> told citizens to “charge everything” as it plans to restrict electricity energy usage following <strong>Russian</strong> [air strikes](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/13/russias-terror-strikes-fail-to-do-much-damage-to-ukraine) on power plants. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said 30% of the country’s plants had been damaged. Electricity supply will be limited only on Thursday for now, but Ukrenergo—whose offices were struck by a drone on Monday—warned there may be more such restrictions during winter.

<strong>Britain’s government</strong> descended further into [chaos ](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/19/welcome-to-britaly)as several of the Conservative Party’s MPs called for Liz Truss to resign as prime minister. There was anger and confusion in the party on Wednesday night after a botched vote on fracking. Earlier, the home secretary, [Suella Braverman](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/10/19/suella-braverman-resigns-as-home-secretary), resigned; she accused Ms Truss of backsliding on the pledges she had made to get herself into Downing Street.

President Vladimir Putin declared <strong>martial law</strong> in the four <strong>Ukrainian</strong> regions that <strong>Russia</strong> partially controls. Mr Putin also ordered an “economic mobilisation” in the eight Russian provinces that border Ukraine, granting local governments the authority to restrict movement. Meanwhile Russian-appointed authorities began evacuating civilians from Kherson, a [crucial southern city](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/30/why-does-kherson-matter), ahead of a Ukrainian attack. Ukraine called the evacuation a “propaganda show”.

The <strong>yen</strong> slid to 150 to the dollar on Thursday, its lowest value since 1990 and a psychological milestone. The <strong>Bank of Japan</strong> recommitted itself to its [policy of bond-buying](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/29/japans-monetary-policymakers-are-sticking-to-their-guns), laying out $667m for purchasing new government debt, to prevent the bonds’ prices from sinking too low. But the central bank is expected to hang on to its near-zero interest rates that have contributed to the [yen’s depreciation](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/will-an-ever-feebler-currency-save-or-sink-japans-economy/21809095).

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

An American appeals court ruled that the <strong>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</strong>, established to ward off predatory lending of the kind that fuelled the crisis of 2007-09, is funded unconstitutionally. The CFPB has attracted the enmity of [payday lenders](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2017/04/08/payday-lending-is-declining) (and other financial institutions) who resent its regulations. Its [unusual funding](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2017/11/30/the-cfpb-born-in-controversy-becomes-a-farce), designed to insulate it from political influence, has become its vulnerability.

<strong>Tesla</strong> reported record quarterly revenues, of $21.5bn, that still fell short of analysts’ forecasts. The [electric-car maker’s](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/01/23/a-tesla-bull-debates-a-tesla-bear) profit reached a near-record, of $3.3bn. Tesla aims to deliver more than 1.4m vehicles in 2022. Meeting that target will require it to increase output in the final three months of the year by 42% from third-quarter levels.

<strong>Nestlé</strong>, the world’s biggest food company, reported growth of 8.5% in sales across the nine months to September, its sharpest rise in 14 years. The business increased its prices by 7.5% in the same period, without losing a significant number of customers. Food everywhere is [becoming more expensive](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/07/food-prices-are-outpacing-wider-inflation-across-most-of-the-world): the cost of food in Britain rose 14.6% in the 12 months to September. 

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> $17bn, the estimated amount Ukraine will need to rebuild critical infrastructure and housing for returnees. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/18/ukraines-economy-seems-to-be-growing-again).

## How do you solve a problem like North Korea?

When the top military minds of America, Japan and South Korea meet on Thursday they will mull a problem that they have failed to solve for 30 years: how to defang North Korea’s ever more menacing nuclear programme. The “hermit kingdom” started the year by testing new missile technology. Over the last month it has engaged in [multiple drills](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/02/03/what-is-behind-north-koreas-flurry-of-missile-tests) designed to show it can use its weapons in combat. American and South Korean spooks expect another nuclear test soon, possibly of the sort of “tactical” weapon that could be used on the battlefield.

So far the response has followed a familiar pattern: shows of military strength, talk of America’s and South Korea’s “ironclad” alliance and threats to annihilate North Korea if it steps out of line. Far from giving pause to Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s dictator, this approach merely gives him more time to develop his weapons. A new strategy may be in order. 

## The EU’s packed agenda

European Union leaders will meet on Thursday to discuss the continent’s [energy crisis](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/13/europe-is-growing-complacent-about-its-energy-crisis) and the war in Ukraine. On the agenda will be emergency measures proposed by the European Commission in Brussels that would compel the EU’s 27 governments to jointly purchase some natural gas. That would prevent European countries from bidding against each other, and thus driving up prices. With national governments pushing different remedies to the crisis, diplomats are playing down the chance of sweeping actions such as price caps on gas imports.

That will leave more time to discuss the [situation in Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis). Funds to keep the government in Kyiv ticking over are needed, as is money for future reconstruction. Hawkish states, mainly in central and eastern Europe, are demanding fresh sanctions against Russia in the wake of its drone strikes on Ukrainian cities; the previous package of sanctions was agreed by EU leaders just two weeks ago.

## An ultimatum at a Ukrainian nuclear plant

Thursday marks the deadline by which occupying Russian officials told Ukrainian technicians at the [Zaporizhia nuclear plant](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/19/what-is-at-stake-at-ukraines-zaporizhia-nuclear-plant) that they had to formally switch their allegiance to Russia. Workers who comply will retain their seniority, vacation days and pensions. Those who refuse risk more than the threat of firing. In the months following Russia’s seizure of Europe’s largest nuclear plant, in south-east Ukraine, in March, dozens of employees sympathetic to Ukraine have been tortured, held for ransom or killed. On Monday two more managers were abducted.

The plant’s pre-invasion workforce has shrunk by more than two-thirds. Many Western observers, including the UN’s nuclear watchdog, fear that additional thinning could lead to a nuclear accident. The Ukrainian state operator, Energoatom, has urged staff to keep working but not switch sides. To complicate the workers’ decision, Ukrainian forces are not far off and [advancing well](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/06/ukraine-has-made-stunning-gains-on-the-battlefield). Ukraine’s government has vowed to prosecute those who collaborate with Russia, though officials have suggested that in this case exceptions could be made.

## Turkey keeps its zany economic policies

With inflation surging to 83% and the Turkish lira down by nearly 30% against the dollar since the start of the year, Recep Tayyip Erdogan might have considered reversing [his unusual policy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/25/the-connection-between-russian-sanctions-and-bizarre-turkish-monetary-policy) of lowering interest rates to rein in consumer prices. Not a bit of it. In its third cut in as many months, on Thursday the country’s central bank slashed its benchmark rate by more than expected, from 12% to 10.5%.

And Turkey’s president promises to keep going. “As long as this brother of yours is in power, the interest rate will continue to fall,” he said earlier this month. Mr Erdogan is desperate to sustain economic growth, which reached 7.6% in the three months to June, ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections next year. That means the benchmark rate may soon reach single digits. Inflation be damned.

## The art of dystopian Britain

The Turner prize for contemporary art in Britain is easy to mock. Over the past 40 years its offerings have included a dishevelled slept-in bed, a pickled cow and calf, and a painting made of elephant dung.

Yet, as a barometer of what the nation cares about, the Turner prize often succeeds. An exhibition of the four artists shortlisted for the 2022 prize opened at Tate Liverpool this week. The show includes photographs by Ingrid Pollard, documenting how black people have been portrayed on imagery such as pub signs and street names; delicate sculptures by Veronica Ryan of seed pouches, avocado stones and magnolia pods, all of which were transported as part of the Atlantic slave economy; and a drag-act video by Sin Wai Kin of a non-binary pop band. The final prize, announced on December 7th, may well go to a creepy installation by Heather Phillipson full of animal eyes accusing mankind of [destroying the planet](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/09/01/climate-change-may-lead-to-staggering-levels-of-migration).
