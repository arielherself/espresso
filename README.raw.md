Voters in <strong>Kansas</strong> [chose to keep](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/03/kansans-vote-to-keep-the-right-to-abortion) the <strong>right to abortion </strong>in the state’s constitution in the first major referendum on the issue since the Supreme Court [overturned](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/06/24/the-supreme-courts-rejection-of-roe-will-hurt-the-poorest-most) <em>Roe v Wade</em>. Officials said that turnout was higher than expected. Meanwhile America’s <strong>Justice Department</strong> sued <strong>Idaho</strong>, alleging that its near-total <strong>abortion</strong> ban—meant to come into effect on August 25th—will criminalise [emergency medical care](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/19/americas-already-dreadful-maternal-mortality-rate-looks-set-to-rise) protected under federal law.

<strong>Nancy Pelosi </strong>left <strong>Taiwan </strong>having met its president, Tsai Ing-wen, and reaffirmed “American solidarity” with the self-governing island. Ms Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, was the most senior [American politician to visit](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/02/nancy-pelosis-trip-to-taiwan-highlights-americas-incoherent-strategy) in 25 years. China’s government summoned the American ambassador in Beijing to register its anger at the trip, and suspended the import of several Taiwanese goods. It also promised to ramp up military drills around the island.

<strong>Olaf Scholz</strong>, Germany’s chancellor, said it could “make sense” to keep the country’s three remaining <strong>nuclear power plants</strong> open amid concerns over [energy supplies](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter) from <strong>Russia</strong>. The plants had been slated for [closure](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/08/15/can-europe-go-green-without-nuclear-power) by the end of the year. Mr Scholz’s comments came as he visited a turbine for the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. Russia cited problems with the turbine as the cause of reduced gas supplies; the European Union disputes that argument.

<strong>Sri Lanka’s</strong> president, <strong>Ranil Wickremesinghe</strong>, said that the country will restart bailout talks with the IMF this month. Mr Wickremesinghe came to power in July following the [ousting](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/19/why-is-sri-lanka-in-turmoil) of his predecessor, Gotabaya Rajapksa. The new president called for a cross-party unity government to be formed to tackle Sri Lanka’s [severe economic crisis](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/28/what-it-will-take-to-fix-sri-lankas-economy) and suggested that presidential powers should be curtailed.

The first shipment of <strong>grain </strong>to leave <strong>Ukraine</strong> since the war began reached Turkey. Under the [agreement ](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/08/01/the-first-grain-ship-leaves-odessa-under-a-un-brokered-deal)signed between Russia and Ukraine last month, the ship will be inspected for weapons and non-food goods in Turkey before continuing its journey to Lebanon. Germany’s former chancellor Gerhard Schröder, a friend of Russia’s president Vladimir Putin, said that the deal may offer a path towards a possible ceasefire.

<strong>Robinhood</strong>, a stock-trading platform for retail investors, is to cut a quarter of its workforce—around 800 jobs. The company became renowned as a place to trade [meme stocks](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/the-phenomenon-of-meme-stocks-could-be-here-to-stay)—those which become inflated following a social-media frenzy. During [its IPO](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/07/26/robinhood-takes-its-ipo-to-the-masses) in 2021 it claimed to house half of all brokerage accounts opened in America since 2016. However revenues have fallen as investors worry about higher interest rates and inflation.

The government of <strong>New Zealand</strong> released the country’s first plan for <strong>climate adaptation</strong>, which includes moving tens of thousands of homes to higher ground to protect them from rising seas and river flooding. The government has committed to drawing up legislation to govern this type of “managed retreat” by the end of 2023. The plan is sketchy on how [such measures](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/03/05/climate-change-must-be-adapted-to-as-well-as-opposed) will be paid for. 

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>12.3%, the rate of inflation in Phoenix, Arizona, where prices are growing much faster than in America’s other metropolitan areas.

## Antony Blinken’s Asian tour

America’s top diplomat, Antony Blinken, lands in Cambodia on Wednesday for summits convened by the Association of South-East Asian Nations. ASEAN events are the apogee of form over substance, yet Mr Blinken’s presence speaks to the growing tussle for influence in the poorer parts of the world between America, China and even Russia. His Chinese and Russian counterparts will also attend the conference. 

While in Phnom Penh Mr Blinken will also meet Hun Sen, Cambodia’s long-standing dictator, before flying to Manila to meet [Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/06/29/by-electing-another-marcos-filipinos-show-they-have-forgotten-history), the new president of the Philippines. Yet his trip risks being overshadowed by that of the speaker of America’s House of Representatives, [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/02/nancy-pelosis-trip-to-taiwan-highlights-americas-incoherent-strategy), to Taiwan. Ms Pelosi met President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday. China, aggrieved by Ms Pelosi’s visit, restricted trade with Taiwan and said it would conduct a series of live-fire military drills in the Taiwan Strait later this week. 

## Europe’s economies feel the squeeze

Evidence of [faltering confidence](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/05/14/businesses-in-britain-are-not-as-gloomy-as-consumers-yet) in Europe’s economies keeps trickling in. More came on Wednesday: in June retail-sales volumes in the EU dropped by 1.3% from May and 2.8% year on year. On Monday Germany reported that sales volumes in the [EU’s biggest economy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/04/30/how-would-an-energy-embargo-affect-germanys-economy) had dropped by 8.8% year on year, the steepest annual fall for at least 28 years. In nominal terms German sales declined by 0.8%, illustrating the squeeze of inflation.

Companies are struggling with the slowing demand. An index from S&amp;P Global, a research firm, suggests that in July output in the euro zone contracted for the first time since February 2021. Activity in France and Italy is at 15- and 18- month lows—and in Germany at the lowest for over two years. German GDP didn’t grow at all in the second quarter, even though exports surged in June. And early signs about the third are ominous.

## A divisive funeral for Abe

On Wednesday Japan’s parliament, known as the Diet, started a three-day extraordinary session. Despite growing calls to discuss the state funeral of [Abe Shinzo](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/08/abe-shinzo-the-champion-of-japan), the former prime minister, who was assassinated last month, legislators will do so only once the session is closed. He will be the second prime minister to be granted a state funeral in postwar Japan (the first was Yoshida Shigeru, in 1967).

In office Abe was a divisive figure. His revisionist approach to history, including the downplaying of Japanese atrocities in the second world war, was especially controversial. He remains a polarising figure even in death: a poll by NHK, the state broadcaster, found that only around half of the Japanese favour taxpayers stumping up for his memorial.

Kishida Fumio, Abe’s successor, represents a similarly nationalist, if less contentious, breed of politics. He may be better placed than Abe was [to pursue](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/14/japan-should-stay-true-to-abe-shinzos-vision-up-to-a-point) their party’s policies, such as increasing defence spending and revising the pacifist constitution. But forcing reluctant Japanese to go into mourning may make that harder.

## A sit-in and a stand-off in Iraq

Everyone seems to be digging in. Since July 30th Iraq’s parliament has been [occupied by](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/01/iraqs-parliamentary-plague) supporters of Muqtada al-Sadr, a Shia cleric and politician. They vow to stay until there are changes to the political system, such as shifting Iraq from a parliamentary regime to a presidential one. Mr Sadr’s rivals, meanwhile, have begun organising counter-protests. This week may bring large demonstrations on the streets of Baghdad. Security forces have so far kept the groups apart. But two of Iraq’s most powerful factions are tipping toward conflict.

At issue is who will run the state—and loot it. Mr Sadr’s party won the largest number of seats in a legislative election in October. But he could not muster enough support to form a coalition government that excluded his Shia rivals. He told his MPs to resign, and his opponents have now nominated a candidate for prime minister. Both camps want to control Iraq’s $89bn budget to steer money to their patronage networks and militias. What Mr Sadr could not achieve through politics, he hopes to take by force.

## Lights, camera, acción: filming in Mexico

“My curse didn’t start in a Mayan temple…” begins the trailer for “¿Qué culpa tiene el Karma?” (“Don’t blame Karma”), a Mexican comedy released on Wednesday on Netflix. When her younger sister and high-school crush get engaged, Sara ponders her bad luck. Unlike its protagonist, the movie has had better fortune. The work of Elisa Miller, an award-winning director, it has benefited from Netflix’s decision to pump money into a series of productions in Latin America to compete for the attention of the world’s 500m-plus Spanish speakers. Last year Netflix committed $300m to original content in Mexico alone.

The cash will boost the region’s filmmakers and production companies. It should also help promote its cinema more generally. In Hollywood blockbusters, Hispanic characters are often pigeonholed in storylines about organised crime. Homegrown works have a broader range. And as [streaming services lose subscribers](https://www.economist.com/business/netflix-sheds-subscribers-and-170bn-in-market-value/21808847) elsewhere, they may be hoping to strike gold in Latin America.
