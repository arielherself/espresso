<strong>Ukrainian</strong><strong> forces </strong>continue to make [significant headway](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/03/as-ukraine-smashes-through-more-russian-lines-russians-wonder-whom-to-blame) in counter-offensives in the east and south of the country, retaking territories in regions which Russia illegally declared as its own last week. In the east Ukrainian military vehicles were reported moving in the direction of <strong>Lysychansk</strong>, an occupied city in the Luhansk region. Ukrainian troops also made rapid gains in the southern province of [Kherson](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/30/why-does-kherson-matter), where their advances could possibly entrap 20,000 Russian soldiers on the west bank of the Dnieper river.

Trading in shares of <strong>Twitter </strong>was suspended amid reports that <strong>Elon Musk </strong>will go ahead with his takeover of the social-media company. Mr Musk is expected to pay the price he initially agreed, of $54.20 a share. For months he had tried to renege on his purchase agreement, resulting in a [legal dispute](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/09/15/twitters-shareholders-approve-elon-musks-44bn-offer) with Twitter that was expected to go to trial later this month. 

Stocks in <strong>Asia</strong> and <strong>Europe</strong> rallied, continuing a trend seen in the American markets, as expectations rose that central banks might ease the pace of interest rate rises in response to an economic slowdown. <strong>Australia’s</strong> central bank raised [interest rates](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/29/global-rate-rises-are-happening-on-an-unprecedented-scale) by a quarter of a percentage point, which was smaller than analysts had expected, but still pushed the policy rate to its highest in more than nine years.

The <strong>Nobel prize for physics</strong> was awarded to Alain Aspect, John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger, for their [work on entangled photons](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/10/04/quantum-entanglement-wins-nobel-physics-laurels) and quantum information science. Their experiments examined particles that behave like a single unit even when separated, paving the way for advances in [quantum information](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/07/13/how-to-preserve-secrets-in-a-quantum-age).

Up to 80% of <strong>Bangladesh’s</strong> territory was left without power after the national grid faltered under excess demand. The country has suffered regular power cuts this year because of shortages in natural gas, which accounts for some 75% of the country’s generation. Power demand in Bangladesh has been driven by [fast-expanding](https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/09/12/bangladesh-tries-to-muffle-the-siren-song-of-the-capital) residential developments.

<strong>Donald Trump</strong>, America’s former president, sued CNN for defamation, claiming over $475m in damages, according to a district court filing in Florida. The suit alleges that the news organisation smeared Mr Trump with increasingly “defamatory labels”, including comparisons with Adolf Hitler, the Nazi dictator. The move comes amid Mr Trump’s own [legal problems](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/09/an-fbi-raid-on-donald-trumps-home-ignites-a-political-firestorm) at both federal and [state levels](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/09/21/donald-trump-faces-a-sweeping-new-lawsuit).

The <strong>Solomon Islands</strong> revealed it persuaded <strong>America</strong> to remove references to <strong>China</strong> from the regional partnership declaration that the pair signed last week, along with more than a dozen Pacific-island countries. The Solomon Islands signed a security deal with China earlier this year and did not want to “choose sides”, according to the country’s foreign minister. America and China are [vying for influence](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/06/02/chinas-interest-in-the-pacific-islands-is-growing) in the region.

## The Kremlin’s botched land grab

The Russian parliament’s approval of the [illegal annexation](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/30/vladimir-putin-illegally-annexes-four-ukrainian-oblasts) of four Ukrainian regions, finalised by its upper house on Tuesday, rubber-stamped President Vladimir Putin’s proclamation that Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhia are part of Russia following [fake referendums](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/27/vladimir-putin-stages-four-fake-referendums-in-occupied-ukraine). The legislation now returns to Mr Putin for his signing into law.

But Mr Putin’s alternative reality adds to his [mounting problems](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/03/as-ukraine-smashes-through-more-russian-lines-russians-wonder-whom-to-blame). The annexations mean that Russia does not control territories it claims. Ukrainian forces have made significant gains on multiple fronts, taking Lyman, a logistics hub in Donetsk, while pushing back into Kherson province in the south. The setbacks are sowing divisions among Russia’s elite. Nezavisimaya, an influential Russian newspaper, called the loss of Lyman “a political problem”, citing Chechnya’s leader, [Ramzan Kadyrov](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/03/16/who-is-ramzan-kadyrov-the-brutal-chechen-leader-claiming-to-be-in-ukraine), who blamed senior military figures for making poor tactical decisions. The rebukes do not yet target Mr Putin, but further losses will only heighten tensions among his lieutenants.

## America’s worker shortage eases slightly

The Job Openings and Labour Turnover Survey used to be a sideshow in American economic data. Over the past year it has become an essential indicator, providing a glimpse into the [ultra-tight job market](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/09/05/why-businesses-are-furiously-hiring-even-as-a-downturn-looms). On Tuesday it showed that 10m jobs were open as of August, down by a million from July. That is exactly what the Federal Reserve wants to see. Although America still has nearly twice as many available jobs as it does unemployed people, the decline in openings suggests the mismatch is easing. That could alleviate the upward pressure on wages that has fed through into [inflation](https://www.economist.com/films/2022/08/04/inflation-and-the-global-economy).

The next question is whether the unemployment rate—next due on Friday—has increased or not. If unemployment holds steady even as job openings decline, that will lend support to the view of optimistic economics that, by skimming off excess demand, America can enjoy a slowdown in inflation without suffering a steep rise in unemployment. It is a glimmer of hope.

## The knotty making of Italy’s government

The leadership of the Northern League, an Italian populist party, met on Tuesday to choose which of its politicians it wants to sit at Giorgia Meloni’s cabinet table. Ms Meloni, the leader of the hard-right Brothers of Italy and [prime minister-in-waiting](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/25/italy-chooses-a-party-with-a-neo-fascist-legacy), is struggling to form a team that reassures Italy’s allies and satisfies her partners in the hard right coalition that [won September’s election](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/28/italys-next-government-may-be-more-nationalist-than-europe-likes).

Ms Meloni will struggle to place Matteo Salvini, the League’s pugnacious secretary. He wants to resume the campaign against irregular immigration he waged as interior minister in 2018-19. One option is putting him back in charge of law and order. But Mr Salvini is on trial for blocking migrants from entering port while in office. There is talk of a deputy premiership. But his past support for Russia makes Italy’s allies in NATO suspicious. He could also be given responsibility for agriculture. But would Mr Salvini, strongly critical of the EU, accept a portfolio in which most important decisions are taken in Brussels?

## A police shooting in London

On September 5th a Metropolitan Police officer shot dead Chris Kaba, an unarmed black man, after chasing the car he was driving through south London. The killing drew hundreds of protesters to Scotland Yard, London’s police headquarters, to decry racism. Little is known about what caused the officer, who has been suspended, to shoot. An automated system linked the vehicle’s number plates to an earlier firearms offence. But more will become clear after an inquest into Mr Kaba’s death opens on Tuesday. The killing is also being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct, a watchdog.

Mr Kaba’s death puts Britain’s largest police force under fresh scrutiny. Buffeted by [scandals](https://www.economist.com/britain/londons-metropolitan-police-service-is-failing-on-three-fronts/21807604), the Met was recently [put under examination](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/06/30/the-metropolitan-police-is-put-into-special-measures) by another watchdog and required to produce a remedial plan for its failures. Its new commissioner, Mark Rowley, promised to be “ruthless” in rooting out wrongdoing. Dealing with the investigation into Mr Kaba’s death will be an early test.

## Pamuk muses on pandemics and politics

Orhan Pamuk, Turkey’s most famous writer, had already spent a few years working on his new novel, a story set against the backdrop of a bubonic plague outbreak in the Ottoman empire in the early 1900s, when the covid pandemic struck. The prolonged lockdowns and concerns about his own health inspired copious rewrites. The resulting book, “[Nights of Plague](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/05/01/turkeys-best-known-author-reflects-on-politics-and-pestilence)”, which came out in Turkish last year, is released in America on Tuesday. 

The novel centres on a murder mystery on a fictional Ottoman island inhabited by both Turks and Greeks, but also muses about the power of modern states. Some of Mr Pamuk’s characters are familiar: Abdulhamid II, a sultan who struggles to save the Ottoman empire, shares autocratic and Islamist tendencies with Turkey’s president, [Recep Tayyip Erdogan](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/06/09/as-elections-approach-turkeys-president-finds-enemies-everywhere). Another resembles the country’s founder, Kemal Ataturk. For a historical novel, “Nights of Plague” can feel quite contemporary.
