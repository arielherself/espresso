<strong>Antony Blinken</strong>, America’s secretary of state, [postponed his planned trip to China](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/02/03/how-a-balloon-burst-sino-american-talks) after the Pentagon detected a Chinese spy balloon flying over Montana. Mr Blinken was due to land in China on Sunday, and was expected to meet with President Xi Jinping. China denied that the object was a spy balloon, claiming it was used for “meteorological” purposes and had been blown off course.

<strong>American employers </strong>added 517,000 jobs in January, an unexpectedly large increase in an already-tight [labour market](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/24/why-american-unemployment-needs-to-rise) and a sign that a recession is not quite close at hand. The unemployment rate fell by 0.1 percentage points to 3.4%, a 53-year low. To policymakers’ relief, wage growth slowed, with average hourly earnings rising by 0.3% from December. Stockmarkets dipped on the news, as investors expect the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates.

The <strong>EU</strong> agreed to a cap of $100 per barrel for exports of <strong>Russia’s refined-oil products</strong>, such as diesel, to take effect on Sunday. Fuel oil and other low-value exports will be capped at $45. A cap of $60 [already applies to Russian crude](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/02/01/why-the-wests-oil-sanctions-on-russia-are-proving-to-be-underwhelming). Insurers and shippers are prohibited from dealing in items covered by the cap unless they were bought below or at the designated price.

As Russia’s forces close in on the battered city of <strong>Bakhmut</strong>, Ukraine’s president said his troops would hold firm. Standing alongside EU leaders in Kyiv on Friday, Volodymr Zelensky declared that “no one will give away Bakhmut.” Meanwhile, America announced a new $2.2bn [aid package](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/01/25/nato-members-are-right-to-send-tanks-to-ukraine) that includes longer-range precision missiles.

<strong>Pope Francis</strong> pleaded for peace in a speech to government officials in Juba, the capital of conflict-ridden [<strong>South Sudan</strong>](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/07/10/south-sudans-second-decade-may-be-as-troubled-as-its-first), where he arrived on Friday. “I beg of you…‘No more of this!’” he said, quoting Jesus in the New Testament, to an audience that included the country’s president. Joining him in South Sudan are the leaders of the Anglican and Scottish Presbyterian churches.

<strong>Google</strong> invested about $300m and took a 10% stake in Anthropic, an <strong>artificial-intelligence</strong> startup, the<em> Financial Times</em> reported on Friday. Big tech is arming itself for [competition in AI](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/30/the-race-of-the-ai-labs-heats-up): Microsoft recently announced a further $10bn investment in and partnership with OpenAI, which built ChatGPT, a chatbot. Anthropic was founded by former employees of OpenAI.

<strong>Bobi</strong>, from Portugal, claimed the title of the world’s oldest dog after reaching the venerable age of 30, according to Guinness World Records. [His breed](https://www.economist.com/interactive/christmas-specials/2022/12/20/what-makes-certain-dogs-popular-in-certain-countries), a purebred Rafeiro do Alentejo, usually lives for around 12 to 14 years. Bobi’s long life was very nearly cut short; his owners intended to put him down as a puppy but he escaped.

<strong>Correction:</strong> In Wednesday’s edition we mistakenly said that Tom Brady had won best player of the season 15 times. Mr Brady has been chosen for the “pro bowl” game, which features the best players of the season, 15 times, but has only been crowned best player three times. Sorry.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>45.3%, the percentage of the world’s population that live in a democracy of some sort. [Read the full story.](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/02/01/the-worlds-most-and-least-democratic-countries-in-2022)

## Tempering Ukraine’s EU aspirations

Ukraine’s desire to [join the EU](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/06/16/the-eu-should-declare-ukraine-a-candidate-for-membership) lies at the heart of its conflict with Russia—which invaded last year to stop the country’s turn to the West. On Friday in Kyiv the bloc’s leaders will hold a summit with Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, and Charles Michel, president of the European Council, will trumpet the EU’s massive financial support to Ukraine and confirm that its candidacy is progressing. But they will also dampen hopes of how quickly it can join.

Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said this week that the country could become a member in two years. EU officials say that is wildly unrealistic. Integrating a huge, impoverished country will be a political challenge. And the bloc demands Ukraine first undertake reforms, including to combat corruption. On February 1st the country’s security services raided the home of a well-known oligarch—earning plaudits from Ms von der Leyen for taking the issue of graft seriously.

## Remaking America’s economy

President Joe Biden has [a plan](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/02/02/joe-bidens-effort-to-remake-the-economy-is-ambitious-risky-and-selfish) to change America’s economy. Audaciously, he has decided that the way to cope with three problems which are too hard to tackle separately is to deal with them all at once.   
  
 In the past two years Congress has passed three bills—on infrastructure, semiconductor chips and greenery—that will make $2trn available. The idea is that, with government action, America can reindustrialise itself, bolster national security and dramatically reduce its carbon emissions all at the same time. 

Those goals will sometimes conflict. Protectionism will infuriate the allies that support American security, if they lose vital home industries to American subsidies. The subsidies will also create inefficiencies: if green products such as wind turbines become more expensive, then the green transition will become costlier, too. Instead money should go towards technologies that are not yet commercially viable, such as new types of nuclear reactor. Nevertheless, America’s plan to spend $2trn could help save the planet.

## Big tech eyes AI

Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Meta have all now reported their most recent quarterly earnings. Apart from Meta, which saw its share price soar after posting better-than-expected results, the news was generally glum. Sales growth in key markets, such as cloud computing, is slowing as customers cut back on spending. In response, America’s tech giants are increasingly betting on [artificial intelligence](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/30/the-race-of-the-ai-labs-heats-up).

On Wednesday Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Meta, talked up investments in AI in its recommendation algorithm and its advertising network. Microsoft has, according to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, invested as much as $10bn in OpenAI, the startup behind [ChatGPT](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/12/08/how-good-is-chatgpt), a popular AI-powered tool that gives human-like responses to questions. The software giant is reportedly working on incorporating OpenAI’s technology into Bing, its search engine. 

Alphabet, Google’s parent company, recently introduced a model that generates music from text. It is expected to respond to Microsoft with its own AI-powered chatbot. And [the vogue for AI](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/30/the-race-of-the-ai-labs-heats-up) is not restricted to Silicon Valley. Baidu, a Chinese search giant, will reportedly launch its own chatbot in March.

## ASEAN’s search for consensus

Foreign ministers from the Association of South-East Asian Nations gather in Jakarta on Friday for their quarterly talkfest. Those watching the region will try to see how the ten-country bloc might be influenced by Indonesia, which recently assumed the chairmanship.  
  
 A representative from Timor-Leste will attend, awaiting final approval of its membership application submitted back in 2011. But the military government of [Myanmar](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/01/31/myanmars-civil-war-has-moved-to-its-heartlands), in power since a violent coup two years ago, is banned from attending. (A “non-political” representative from Myanmar has been invited instead.)

ASEAN relies on consensus. Yet its menagerie of different models of government, from Communist one-party states, such as Vietnam, to vibrant democracies, including the Philippines, makes it hard for members to agree. The bloc has shown some courage in pushing back against Chinese bullying in the [South China Sea](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/02/01/chinas-put-upon-maritime-neighbours-are-pushing-back). But its feeble five-point peace plan for Myanmar is languishing, ignored by the generals (hence their exclusion). Indonesia will hope to revive progress.

## What’s it like to be a donkey?

The latest film by Jerzy Skolimowski, a Polish writer-director, has an unusual main character: a donkey. This unconventional casting has gone down well with critics. “EO” secured an Oscar nomination for best international feature film.

The film tells the story of its titular long-eared protagonist, whose name, EO, is a phonetic spelling of its bray. EO travels from a circus in Poland to Italy, and is betrayed, neglected and mistreated by humans along the way. The director takes pains not to anthropomorphise his subject and the film reveals the world through EO’s eyes—at times literally, with the camera positioned at the creature’s sightline.

What prompted the octogenarian film-maker to work with such a proverbially obstinate beast? Mr Skolimowski was motivated, in part, by animal-welfare concerns. And his respect for animals deepened during filming, as he bonded with the donkeys in his cast. According to Mr Skolimowski, donkeys “are stubborn, but they’re not stupid.”
