America’s attorney-general named a <strong>special counsel </strong>to investigate how <strong>classified documents</strong> from <strong>Joe Biden’s</strong> tenure as vice-president during the Obama administration remained in his private possession. Two batches of documents have been discovered, at Mr Biden’s think-tank and in the garage of his Delaware home. Congressional Republicans, seeking to divert attention from [Donald Trump’s documents scandal](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/10/the-raid-on-mar-a-lago-could-shake-americas-foundations), an investigation with its own special counsel, have promised their own inquiry.

<strong>Consumer prices</strong> in America fell by 0.1% in December, the first monthly decline since May 2020. The drop is attributable to a reduction in the price of fuel and lower consumer demand. Annual inflation to December remains at 6.5%, higher than the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, but well below a peak of 9.1% in June.

<strong>Argentina</strong> was less fortunate—in December its annual <strong>inflation</strong> rate hit 95%, a three-decade high. Prices rose by 5.1% from the previous month. Last year only Zimbabwe, Lebanon, Venezuela, Syria and Sudan saw higher inflation, all in the triple digits. In 1989, when Argentina endured a bout of severe [hyperinflation](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/01/31/hyperinflations-can-end-quickly-given-the-right-sort-of-regime-change), prices rocketed by more than 3,000%.

Recep Tayyip Erdogan, <strong>Turkey’s</strong> president, summoned the <strong>Swedish </strong>ambassador after a Kurdish group in Stockholm hanged an effigy of Mr Erdogan and likened him to Mussolini. Relations between the two countries are tense as they negotiate Sweden’s accession to NATO, which Turkey [agreed](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/06/28/turkey-lifts-its-block-on-letting-sweden-and-finland-join-nato) to but has yet to ratify. Mr Erdogan has [accused ](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2022/05/30/recep-tayyip-erdogan-on-nato-expansion)Sweden of “supporting” the PKK, a Kurdish group that he considers a terrorist organisation.

<strong>Russia</strong> released <strong>Taylor Dudley</strong>, an American navy veteran whom it detained after he entered the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad in April. Mr Dudley is the second American citizen [freed](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/05/how-do-prisoner-swaps-work) from Russian prisons in just over a month. Meanwhile, 500 Ukrainian civilians remain trapped in Soledar, a town in eastern Ukraine that is being fiercely fought over, according to local officials.

<strong>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co</strong>, one of the world’s [largest chipmakers](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/10/17/the-american-chip-industrys-15trn-meltdown), reported a record quarterly profit of NT$295.9bn ($9.4bn). Strong demand for high-performance chips for 5G infrastructure and gadgets meant that TSMC bucked the trend of collapsing profits for technology firms.

<strong>Georg Gänswein</strong>, a catholic archbishop and friend to the [late Pope Benedict XVI](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/01/02/the-death-of-pope-benedict-removes-a-problem-for-liberal-catholics), released his long-awaited memoir. In “Nothing But the Truth: My Life Beside Pope Benedict XVI” Archbishop Gänswein, nicknamed “Gorgeous George”, makes public the tense relationship between <strong>Pope Benedict</strong> and his successor <strong>Pope Francis</strong>. During an interview, Archbishop Gänswein said Pope Francis’s restrictions on Latin Mass “pained Benedict&#x27;s heart”.

## Inflation in America softens, but not quite enough

America’s monthly [inflation](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2022/11/14/how-does-the-past-help-us-predict-policy-on-inflation-in-2023) reports are now awaited more with optimism than dread. On Thursday figures confirmed that bias: overall prices edged down by 0.1% in December compared with November. In year-on-year terms, it was the sixth straight month of diminishing inflationary pressure. Optimists think that could allow the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates sooner rather than later, which would boost America’s chances of avoiding a serious recession.

Alas, pessimists have a more downbeat interpretation. The main reason for milder inflation has been a fall in prices for energy and some consumer goods, as supply chains recover from the disruption caused by the pandemic. But the Fed has made it clear that it is now most concerned about how rising wages are feeding into higher prices for services such as transportation and medical care. Until there is ample evidence that the labour market is weakening, the Fed is likely to stay on the warpath against inflation.

## Indian tech braces for a global recession

India’s IT sector has [boomed](https://www.economist.com/business/a-half-a-trillion-dollar-bet-on-revolutionising-white-collar-work/21808453) since the pandemic. The revenues of companies such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys and Wipro, [soared](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/08/how-technology-is-redrawing-the-boundaries-of-the-firm) as other firms digitised their operations. On Monday TCS, the biggest Indian IT company, reported annual revenue growth of 13.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022. That netted it a profit of $1.3bn. On Thursday Infosys, the second-largest, is expected to report similarly strong results. 

Yet a looming global recession will eat into future growth. Demand for outsourcing and IT consulting will wane, especially in Europe, the destination of about 30% of India’s IT-service exports. TCS has already cut its workforce by about 2,200 employees, from a total of more than 600,000. Infosys will also be feeling wary. When demand fell during the euro zone’s [debt crisis of 2012](https://www.economist.com/free-exchange/2012/05/02/call-it-a-depression), the firm took years to recover. There could be more lay-offs to come.

## Sweden’s plans for the EU

The European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, will feel the Arctic chill on Thursday as she visits Kiruna, a city in northern Sweden. The commission is planning for the coming six months, during which Sweden, as holder of the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU, will chair meetings of EU ministers. 

In Europe, many matters of high politics remain the purview of national governments. But the energy and economic crises triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine require a co-ordinated approach. So does a response to America’s new [green-subsidies programme](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/01/09/what-americas-protectionist-turn-means-for-the-world), which threatens European competitiveness by favouring American firms. 

Sweden’s government, led by Ulf Kristersson, hopes to focus on making the EU more competitive by encouraging members to avoid over-regulation. That will involve fending off attempts by other member states, including France, to devise spending programmes that mollycoddle the economy. Mr Kristersson will hope the reception to his government’s ideas is less frosty than the weather.

## A fragile peace in Tigray

On Thursday the German and French foreign ministers arrived in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, to demonstrate support for a peace process that only months ago seemed fanciful. Their hope is that an agreement signed in November by Ethiopia’s government and the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front, a party and armed group long dominant in Tigray, a region in the north, will end a civil war that has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths through fighting, hunger and disease. The deal is supposed to lead to the dissolution of the TPLF-led regional government in Tigray, the election of which in 2020, in defiance of a federal edict, helped spark the conflict. 

Tigrayan commanders are demobilising their forces. But there remain obstacles to strengthening the fragile peace. One is the presence of soldiers from Eritrea, who[ fought alongside Ethiopian government forces](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/06/eritrea-has-called-up-thousands-of-reservists-to-fight-in-tigray) in the recent conflict. Eritrea’s dictator, Issaias Afewerki, has his own scores to settle with the TPLF, which led Ethiopia during a bloody war against Eritrea between 1998 and 2000. He may yet spoil the peace by refusing to withdraw his troops.

## The climate in 2022, and beyond

On Thursday NOAA and NASA, America’s weather and space agencies, released their annual summary of global climate conditions for the previous 12 months. As the world warms, these reports are increasingly alarming—and 2022’s is no different.

Last year saw an exceptionally strong [La Niña](https://www.economist.com/interactive/the-world-ahead/2022/11/18/the-weather-system-that-influences-the-world), a weather pattern which influences winds and rainfall. Because of how they push cold water around the oceans, La Niña years are typically cooler than average. But NOAA reckons that 2022 was still the sixth-warmest on record (NASA, along with the EU’s climate agency, using slightly different methods, puts it in fifth place).That indicates the extent of underlying temperature rise. The trend towards wilder weather was also evident throughout 2022, which saw catastrophic flooding in Pakistan, sweltering heat waves across America, Asia and Europe, and many storms.

The year ahead will probably be even more extreme. La Niña—which is now in a highly-unusual third year—will worsen food and water shortages in Africa. The weather pattern is then expected to subside, pushing temperatures up. Models indicate that 2023 may be the hottest year ever.
