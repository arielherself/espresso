<strong>Vladimir</strong><strong> Putin</strong>, Russia’s president, declared the illegal <strong>annexation</strong> of four regions of Ukraine during an address at the Kremlin. The announcement followed [sham referendums](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/29/ignore-putins-fake-referendums-and-keep-helping-ukraine) in the areas. Mr Putin warned Ukraine and the West that the sovereignty of these areas would not be open to future negotiation. <strong>America</strong> responded by announcing another round of sanctions on Russia. It also sponsored a draft resolution condemning the annexation at the UN Security Council. China and India abstained but ten countries in the 15-member body voted for the measure, which Russia vetoed.

<strong>American shares</strong> continued their poor run. The S&amp;P 500 index shed 1.5% on Friday and 5.3% over the past quarter, notching up a [third straight quarter of losses](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/09/30/wall-street-extends-its-worst-run-since-the-financial-crisis) for the first time since 2008-09. Meanwhile, new figures showed that in August the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of annual inflation, the personal-consumption-expenditures price index, rose higher than expected, to 4.9%, excluding food and energy.

<strong>Hurricane</strong> Ian made landfall in South Carolina as a category-one storm, having left at least 21 people [dead in Florida](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/09/29/hurricane-ian-pummels-florida). Ian is forecast to move towards North Carolina before dissipating by Saturday evening near the border with Virginia. More than one million Floridians had their power restored, about half the number affected. More casualties are expected.

<strong>North Korea </strong>fired two ballistic missiles off its east coast, according to South Korean officials. The launches follow tests earlier this week and come a day after America, Japan and South Korea staged joint-military exercises. Yoon Suk-yeol, South Korea’s president, warned North Korea that any [attempted use of nuclear arms](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/04/07/north-korea-is-testing-icbms-again-nuclear-weapons-may-be-next) would result in a “resolute and overwhelming response”. 

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

Standard &amp; Poor’s downgraded its outlook for <strong>Britain’s</strong> credit rating to “negative” from “stable”. The ratings agency said there were “additional risks” in lending to Britain following the government’s [mini-budget](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically) announced last week. Meanwhile Kwasi Kwarteng, the chancellor, defended the government’s decisions. Writing in <em>The Telegraph</em>, he insisted his government’s economic plan is “sound, credible and will work to drive growth”.

The director-general of the <strong>Zaporizhia</strong> nuclear power plant in Ukraine was detained by Russian troops, jeopardising “the safety of operation”, said the company running the plant. Russia has occupied Zaporizhia since early March and in recent weeks Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of [shelling](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2022/09/06/how-to-prevent-a-crisis-at-the-zaporizhia-nuclear-power-plant-according-to-a-fukushima-veteran) the site.

An army captain in <strong>Burkina Faso</strong> confirmed the ouster of Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Henri Damiba, the country’s leader. Ibrahim Traore made the announcement on state television accompanied by a group of masked soldiers. He blamed the military government&#x27;s inability to deal with an Islamist insurgency for the coup, the second this year. Colonel Damiba had [overthrown an elected government](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/01/29/a-coup-in-burkina-faso-will-help-the-sahels-jihadists) in January.

<strong>Word of the week: </strong><em>dedovshchina, </em>the name for the tradition of hazing conscripts in Russia. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/24/how-russia-is-conscripting-men-to-fight-in-ukraine).

## Seeking investment, Ukraine hosts a business shindig

The backdrop for IT Arena 2022, a business conference that ends on Saturday in Lviv, in western Ukraine, looks grim. On Friday Russia forcibly annexed a sizable chunk of the country, annual inflation is around 20%, wages have been cut and Ukraine’s economy is on track to shrink this year by nearly a third. But conditions could be worse. Earlier in the war it looked as though GDP would fall by half. Unemployment is falling, albeit from frightful heights. Hiring is [strongest in western areas](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/06/30/tracking-changes-to-ukraines-economy) such as Lviv, where IT Arena 2022 attendees have gathered at secret venues. One is underground; the other has bomb shelters.

Aiming to make the most of Ukraine’s reputation for resourceful resistance and plucky entrepreneurialism, the government has launched Advantage Ukraine, a programme to boost foreign investment. Red tape is being cut. Hundreds of permit requirements have been scrapped. Ukraine, its economy minister says, seeks not humanitarian aid, but investment, which “we understand…as blood for the Ukrainian economy”.

## China’s National Day holidays

In normal times, China’s “Golden Week” vacation, which begins on Saturday, calls forth a glut of holiday spending. But wallets are lighter this year. Sporadic lockdowns to stamp out covid-19 have worsened an [economic slump](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/08/18/chinas-economy-is-beset-by-problems). Would-be travellers also fear getting trapped—150,000 got stuck at the beach resorts of Hainan, a southern island province, during a covid outbreak this summer. Tourist spending during last year’s holidays was just 60% of that in pre-covid times. This year could be worse.

The Communist Party will try to cheer up gloomy staycationers. State media call for patriotic “positive energy” in time for a party congress later in October, at which [Xi Jinping](https://www.economist.com/theprincepod) is likely to be awarded a third term as leader. A film about heroic diplomats rescuing overseas Chinese from a war zone will hit cinemas, to lift spirits. “The motherland will never leave behind any citizen,” intones one character in the film’s trailer. Officials will hope a lockdown does not close cinemas and stop people getting the patriotic message.

## A documentary about sisterhood in Myanmar

When the Burmese army [drove 700,000 Rohingyas](https://www.economist.com/asia/2017/09/09/a-state-led-massacre-triggers-an-exodus-of-rohingyas-from-myanmar), a mainly Muslim ethnic minoritiy, out of Myanmar in 2017, the news that reached the rest of the country was mostly state propaganda demonising those forced into exile. Filmed between 2016 and 2021 in a Rakhine village, Snow Hnin Ei Hlaing’s documentary tells a different tale. “Midwives”, which won a prize at this year’s Sundance Film Festival and was released in Britain on Friday, follows Hla, a tough-talking Buddhist Rakhine midwife and Nyo Nyo, her ambitious Muslim Rohingya apprentice.

Their friendship is tested by personal quarrels, as well as by escalating conflict and racial hatred. The babies they deliver, born into the world’s largest stateless minority, face an uncertain future. But the women are united in their mission to help Rohingya mothers and other patients. The country’s Bamar ethnic majority, says Ms Snow Hlaing, found a new solidarity with persecuted minorities after a [bloody coup last February](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/02/06/myanmars-coup-turns-the-clock-back-a-decade). “The whole country became like the Rohingya.”

## Black rhinos may be better off hornless

It is a sorry state of affairs when protecting a species from annihilation requires hacking off its most prominent feature. Nevertheless, that is what many African rhinoceros reserves have resorted to, to protect their charges from poachers. Dehorning rhinos is seen as the ultimate poacher-deterrent—it is the value of the horn that they are willing to kill for. And although dehorning is painless, its critics have suggested it may harm rhinos’ well-being or reproduction.

A study in the <em>European Journal of Wildlife Research</em> allays some of those fears. It looked at four subpopulations of black rhinos in Namibia, three of which had undergone dehorning. Reassuringly, in all markers of population growth (lifespan, birth rates and offspring survival) dehorned rhinos were doing just as well as horned ones. And while a hornless rhino may look somewhat diminished, it is certainly preferable to one slain by poachers.

## Weekend profile: Yevgeny Prigozhin, Putin’s private-army supremo

This week [Yevgeny Prigozhin](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/29/who-is-yevgeny-prigozhin-the-man-behind-the-wagner-group) stepped out of the shadows. The close ally of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, admitted for the first time that he founded the [Wagner Group](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/03/07/what-is-the-wagner-group-russias-mercenary-organisation), a network of guns-for-hire that does much of Russia’s dirty work. “I cleaned the old weapons myself, sorted out the bulletproof vests myself,” said Mr Prigozhin of Wagner’s early days.

The mercenaries emerged in Ukraine in 2014 to aid Russia’s annexation of Crimea and back up pro-Russian separatists in the eastern Donbas region. The group then expanded wherever Russia had an interest, including [Syria](https://www.economist.com/europe/2017/11/02/how-wagner-came-to-syria), [Libya](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/12/12/foreign-powers-are-piling-into-libya), the Central African Republic and Mali.

As for Mr Prigozhin, little is known about his childhood. He spent most of his 20s in prison, serving nine years for robbery and fraud. After his release, he set up a hot-dog stand in St Petersburg in the 1990s. He soon opened chic eateries: his New Island floating restaurant was a favourite of Mr Putin, at the time deputy mayor of St Petersburg. His associations with Russia’s elite brought lucrative catering gigs for schools, hospitals and the army—and earned him the nickname “Putin’s Chef”. But it was his work outside the kitchen that earned him a reputation in the West. In 2018 American prosecutors indicted Mr Prigozhin, alleging that he financed a Russian “troll farm” to [spread online misinformation](https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/02/17/putins-chef-cooks-up-a-storm) during the presidential election in 2016.

Mr Prigozhin long denied involvement in Wagner’s bloody operation, and sued journalists who suggested as much. Since the outbreak of war in Ukraine the group may have helped capture several eastern cities. Mr Prigozhin is putting his name to that. He may think that Russia’s tattered relationship with the West means there is no more point in maintaining the open secret. He may also be reminding Mr Putin, amid [battlefield losses](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/15/a-stunning-counter-offensive-by-ukraines-armed-forces) and a backlash against mobilisation at home, of his loyalty and value.
