<strong>COP27 </strong>in Egypt finally concluded on Sunday morning, 36 hours late, with delegates agreeing to establish a “[loss and damage](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/03/what-is-climate-loss-and-damage)” fund to help those most affected by rising temperatures—something many thought impossible two weeks ago. That seemed to be broadly welcomed by environmental groups. They were less enthused by timid measures to reduce the use of fossil fuels.

<strong>Malaysia</strong> looks set for a hung parliament, after none of the three big coalitions secured a majority in the country’s general election. A group led by [Anwar Ibrahim](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/11/10/malaysias-grand-old-party-eyes-a-comeback), the opposition leader, won the most seats; he is trying to attract support from enough other MPs to form a government. An alliance that includes Muhyiddin Yassin, a former prime minister, and an Islamic party, fared surprisingly well.

<strong>Elon Musk</strong>, Twitter’s [new boss](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/31/how-will-elon-musk-shape-twitter), said that <strong>Donald Trump’s </strong>account will be reinstated. Mr Musk had launched a poll on the social-media platform asking users whether to allow the former president back onto the site. They narrowly voted “yes”. Mr Trump was banned from Twitter for life in the wake of the Capitol riot in 2021.

<strong>John Ray, </strong>the new CEO of <strong>FTX</strong>, until recently one of the world’s biggest crypto exchanges, said that he is looking to sell or restructure its businesses. Mr Ray took over from [Sam Bankman-Fried](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/11/17/what-sam-bankman-frieds-downfall-means-for-effective-altruism), the exchange’s founder, amid the company’s implosion. The saga has left behind 1m creditors and triggered several investigations. A timeline for the possible sale is not clear.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Ukraine’s</strong> prime minister, [Denys Shmyhal](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/ukraines-prime-minister-says-reconstruction-planning-must-start-now/21808965), said almost half of the country’s power[ grid](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/24/ukraine-races-to-stop-russia-from-destroying-its-power-grid) had been disabled by Russian missile strikes. The attacks have left swathes of Ukraine without <strong>electricity</strong>, just as Kyiv, the capital, had its first snowfall of the season. On Thursday President Volodymyr Zelensky said that 10m Ukrainians had no power.

<strong>FIFA’s</strong> president, Gianni Infantino, called Western critics of the [decision](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/17/in-defence-of-qatars-hosting-of-the-world-cup) to hold the football World Cup in Qatar “hypocrites”. In a lengthy and often bizarre defence of the tournament—“Today I feel gay! Today I feel migrant worker!”—Mr Infantino said Europe should apologise for its own shortcomings before attacking Qatar over its poor treatment of LGBT people and migrant workers.

Kamala Harris, <strong>America’s </strong>vice-president, spoke briefly with Xi Jinping, <strong>China’s </strong>president, at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum meeting in Thailand. Ms Harris said she emphasised the need to keep lines of communication between the countries open. On Monday President Joe Biden met Mr Xi for the [first time](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/11/10/can-joe-biden-and-xi-jinping-stabilise-sino-american-relations) during his presidency.

<strong>Word of the week: </strong><em>kafala</em>, an Arabic word roughly meaning “sponsorship”. Workers under Qatar’s <em>kafala </em>system often have their freedom curtailed.

## Macron attends Francophone summit

After a week in Asia, Emmanuel Macron on November 19th heads to Djerba, an island in Tunisia. There the French president will attend the Francophone summit, a bi-annual get-together of leaders of French-speaking countries. It is often an awkward gathering: an attempt to reaffirm the vitality of their common language at a time when French is challenged by the spread of English, Mandarin Chinese and other tongues. Many Francophones contest the rigid guardianship of the language by post-colonial France. Today, of the 321m people who speak French, 62% live in Africa.

Mr Macron has long argued for a less formal, more vibrant way for Francophone countries to interact, once calling La Francophonie “a tired club”. But, informally, culture will not be the only talking point. The French president may well also want to discuss the war in Ukraine and insecurity in the [African Sahel](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/03/05/the-worlds-centre-of-terrorism-has-shifted-to-the-sahel)–France withdrew its troops from Mali after a coup in August 2021 and closed a counter-terrorist operation there.

## Malaysia goes to the polls

For the first time in its history, Malaysia may end up with a hung parliament after major coalitions failed to win a simple majority in [Saturday’s general election](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/11/10/malaysias-grand-old-party-eyes-a-comeback). Political uncertainty is nothing new in Malaysia. Since the most recent vote, in 2018, there have been three prime ministers from three different parties. Distracted by bickering and backstabbing, no one has governed well. 

The ruling Barisan Nasional coalition had promised stability, hoping that voters would look past its atrocious record of corruption. The lead party in the ascendant Perikatan Nasional coalition wanted the government to be as devoutly Islamic as the country’s Malay majority, to the dismay of Indian and Chinese voters. And the Pakatan Harapan coalition hoped to rack up votes in cities by talking about good governance, something it failed to deliver after triumphing in 2018. With no clear winner, a combination of parties will now have to negotiate an alliance. The next government will be chosen not just in polling booths but in smoke-filled rooms.

## “Sarajevo Safari” reopens wounds of the siege

A documentary with disturbing new allegations about the siege of Sarajevo screened at Istanbul’s International Crime and Punishment Film Festival this week. “Sarajevo Safari”, a film by Miran Zupanic, a Slovenian, alleges that during the Bosnian war of 1992-95 certain foreigners paid Serbian forces to allow them to fire upon civilians in the city. An unidentified man working for an American agency says he witnessed this. And a Bosnian army veteran tells of a captured combatant who recounted how foreigners, dressed for hunting, spoke of paying for the opportunity to shoot.

The allegation that outsiders were invited to fire into Sarajevo is not new. (Footage exists of a Russian writer, the late Eduard Limonov, apparently doing so.) But the charge that money changed hands has fuelled fresh outrage. After “Sarajevo Safari” was shown in Sarajevo itself in September, the Bosnian prosecutor’s office opened a new investigation into the shootings. The documentary is due to appear on Balkan television in January.

## Polish sculpture in London

As a youngster Magdalena Abakanowicz saw the horror of the second world war at close range. Drunk German soldiers invaded her home and shot her mother. Ms Abakanowicz discovered that making art was a way to feel free. The Polish textile artist’s extraordinary work went on display at the Tate Modern museum in London on Thursday. 

Her sculptures, made from fibres like horsehair, sisal and braided hemp, are meditations on the power of imagination to overcome oppression. After the war, while seeking to study at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, she changed her name and posed as the daughter of a clerk—any sign of her landowning heritage would have led to her being denounced as a class enemy and jeopardised her place. At the time Socialist Realism was considered the only acceptable art form. In 1960 one of Ms Abakanowicz’s shows was censored after being categorised as Formalist and therefore dangerous. “In Poland it was almost forbidden to talk about mystery,” she told the <em>New York Times</em>. “I did.” 

## Weekend profile: Changpeng Zhao, boss of Binance

The implosion of [FTX](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/09/the-spectacular-fall-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried), until recently a major crypto exchange, has left plenty of people with egg on their faces. But one crypto giant has emerged stronger—at least for now. Binance has cemented its status as the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. And [Changpeng Zhao](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/11/16/who-is-changpeng-zhao-the-chief-executive-of-binance), its 45-year-old co-founder and boss, has triumphed. The crypto crash may have taken its toll on Mr Zhao’s fortune, but he is still worth a cool $17bn. 

Mr Zhao was born in China in 1977. When he was 12 his family, facing repression at home, fled to Canada. But after studying computer science at McGill University in Montreal, Mr Zhao returned to China. In 2015, convinced that bitcoin “would do to finance what the internet would do to information,” he launched Bijie Tech, which offered software to crypto exchanges, in Shanghai. 

China soon shut down all crypto exchanges, but Mr Zhao was undeterred, skirting Chinese restrictions by relocating to various hubs around Asia. In July 2017 he launched his own cryptocurrency exchange, Binance. Today dozens of billions of dollars worth of assets change hands each day on the platform; Binance usually takes a 0.1% fee for its trouble. 

The company has thrived thanks to Mr Zhao’s ruthless decision-making. At the height of the boom in ICOs (initial coin offerings) in 2017, Binance rushed to list the flurry of newly launched cryptocurrencies, as other exchanges dawdled. Earlier this month, after rumours of trouble emerged at FTX, Mr Zhao said that Binance would sell $600m-worth of an FTX token—a move that precipitated his rival’s cash crunch. 

A complete crash across the sector would probably obliterate Mr Zhao’s wealth, most of which [is held](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2021/12/18/the-most-powerful-people-in-crypto) in digital assets. And Binance faces other problems. Critics say Mr Zhao’s taste for “controlled chaos”, his reliance on a small inner circle and his ravenous appetite for growth have led to corner-cutting. The exchange’s history is peppered with damaging hacks and allegations of money-laundering. This week Mr Zhao promised more transparency and said Binance would prove that it has enough liquid assets to face any crisis. Yet as the crypto crash deepens and regulators come sniffing, the digital Teflon Man may not prove resistant to corrosion forever.
