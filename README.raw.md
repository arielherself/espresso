[Valery Zaluzhny](https://www.economist.com/zaluzhny-transcript), head of <strong>Ukraine’s</strong> armed forces, said that Russia fired 36 missiles at his country on Wednesday night. Russia said it had broken through two of Ukraine’s defence lines in the east and pushed its troops back by 3km. [Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/02/09/thousands-of-ukrainian-soldiers-are-suffering-with-ptsd) denied the claim and said it is inflicting heavy losses on enemy troops. On Wednesday, NATO allies pledged more military support ahead of its spring counter-offensive.

<strong>David Malpass</strong> will step down as president of the <strong>World Bank</strong> by June, nearly a year before his five-year term ends. Appointed by the Trump administration, [Mr Malpass](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/02/05/donald-trump-picks-david-malpass-to-run-the-world-bank) was criticised last autumn for initially refusing to state that human activity had contributed to global warming. America’s treasury secretary recently demanded that the World Bank take “bolder and more imaginative” steps to tackle climate change.

<strong>Centrica</strong>, the owner of British gas, reported record profits of £3.3bn ($4bn), triple its earnings in the previous year, after energy prices rose across Europe. Its customer base grew by 4%. But the success of Britain’s largest energy provider comes as the country grapples with a [cost-of-living](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/04/21/a-guide-to-britains-cost-of-living-crunch) crunch, and follows accusations of the company force-fitting prepayment metres in the homes of vulnerable customers.

<strong>American</strong> officials reportedly believe that the <strong>Chinese</strong> [spy balloon](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/02/07/the-lessons-from-the-chinese-spy-balloon) shot down on February 4th was originally on course to collect information from military bases in Guam and Hawaii. On Wednesday the White House said that three unidentified high-flying objects that have been shot down over North America since Friday may be “benign”. The downing of the Chinese balloon caused a [diplomatic ruckus](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/02/09/cold-war-lessons-from-chinas-spy-balloon).

<strong>Israel</strong> [passed a law](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/29/israels-new-government-is-the-most-right-wing-ever) to revoke the citizenship of Israeli Arabs, and the residency rights of Palestinians, convicted of terrorism or receiving funds from the Palestinian Authority. The PA gives stipends to the families of Palestinian prisoners who have attacked Israelis; already Israel freezes those assets. Human-rights groups criticised the law for rendering people stateless.

Thousands of <strong>Chinese</strong> pensioners took to the streets of Wuhan and Dalian, two big cities, to protest against cuts to their health benefits. Last week provincial officials said they would reduce the amount of medical expenses retirees could claim from their health-savings plans. China is tightening spending following its [costly zero-covid policy](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/12/01/xi-jinpings-zero-covid-policy-has-turned-a-health-crisis-into-a-political-one). Such demonstrations are rare in China; this was the second in a week.

Jaime Rogozinski, the founder of <strong>WallStreetBets</strong>, an internet forum, that popularised investment into [“meme” stocks](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/07/06/are-meme-stocks-harmless-fun-or-a-threat-to-the-financial-old-guard), is suing <strong>Reddit, </strong>the social-media site where the forum was based. Mr Rogozinski accused Reddit of breaching contract by ousting him as the forum’s moderator in 2020, on grounds he said were a pretext to prevent him from controlling a “famous brand”. Reddit dismissed the lawsuit as “completely frivolous”.

## Scottish independence after Sturgeon

Three weeks ago Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, said she did not feel “anywhere near” stepping down. On Wednesday, she resigned, citing the heavy toll the job has taken on her personal life. This leaves Scotland’s independence movement at a crossroads. 

The Scottish National Party, to which she belongs, has been in power in Scotland since 2007, and champions the country leaving the United Kingdom. Ms Sturgeon took over as leader in 2014, shortly after a referendum in which Scottish voters rejected independence. Since then there has been stalemate. Britain’s government has refused permission for another referendum and last year the Supreme Court ruled that Scotland’s devolved government lacked the authority to organise its own.

Ms Sturgeon will remain first minister until a replacement is found. In March SNP members will vote on whether to treat the next general election, due by January 2025, as a de facto referendum. A decision to do so would be a gamble. Voters are roughly split on independence and more than two thirds of Scots oppose a proxy referendum. But the SNP’s most immediate problem is the departure of a charismatic and canny leader with no clear successor.

## Wang Yi’s European tour

On Thursday China’s most senior diplomat, Wang Yi, will be in Italy to meet the country’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. It will be Mr Wang’s third day of a European tour that has already taken him to France and is expected to include stops at the EU in Brussels, as well as Germany, Hungary and Russia. 

The trip comes amid a row over [Chinese surveillance balloons](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/02/09/tensions-will-linger-over-a-chinese-balloon-downed-by-america), one of which was shot down by America over the Atlantic on February 4th. The balloon’s incursion into American airspace caused America’s secretary of state, Antony Blinken, to [cancel](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/02/03/how-a-balloon-burst-sino-american-talks) a visit to Beijing that was planned for last week. In Germany Mr Wang is expected to attend the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of security and military bigwigs which begins on Friday. A rumoured meeting there with Mr Blinken would aim to lower tensions. But Mr Wang’s visit to Russia, days before the anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine, highlights another sore spot in China’s relations with the West: its tacit support for Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked aggression.

## Will Paramount’s reboot succeed?

“Unscripted”, a book published this week, chronicles the dysfunctional final years of Sumner Redstone, a nonagenarian billionaire, and his family atop the sprawling media empire he founded. (Redstone died in 2020.) Paramount Global, that conglomerate, which includes CBS, MTV, Paramount Pictures, Showtime and Simon &amp; Schuster, is now run by his daughter, [Shari Redstone](https://www.economist.com/business/2016/08/25/in-the-name-of-the-father). On Thursday it will report its latest quarterly results.  
  
 While Paramount’s share price is nearly 40% below its level twelve months ago, a rally in recent weeks suggests increasing optimism over Ms Redstone’s stewardship. Paramount+, its streaming service, has garnered some 55m subscribers in under two years. [“Top Gun: Maverick”](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/05/26/top-gun-maverick-feels-the-need-to-speed-into-the-past), an action reboot starring Tom Cruise and produced by Paramount Pictures, was a hit last year. A new buyer is being sought for Simon &amp; Schuster, a book publisher, after a proposed merger with Penguin Random House was blocked on competition grounds. Investors will be hoping for more signs of a successful reboot.

## Arresting Hong Kong’s decline

“Will the last person to leave…turn out the lights.” So ran a famous <em>Sun</em> headline at the prospect of people fleeing dysfunctional Britain. In tropical Hong Kong they’ll have to remember to switch off the air conditioner too. On Thursday the territory reported a population decline in 2022 of 68,300—around 1% of its people—the third straight year it has fallen. 

A low birth rate doesn’t help. But mostly people were fleeing recession and suffocating covid-containment measures. And it is no coincidence the exodus began in 2020, when China “gifted” Hong Kong a swingeing [national-security law](https://www.economist.com/interactive/essay/2022/07/01/how-hong-kong-became-a-police-state). 

Hong Kong’s chief executive, [John Lee](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/04/09/john-lee-a-tough-former-policeman-looks-set-to-lead-hong-kong), knows he has a problem. He remains committed to [suppressing freedoms](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/02/09/hong-kong-starts-its-largest-national-security-trial), but he has launched a scheme allowing international high-flyers to relocate to the city without needing a job offer. Thousands of new homes are planned to help reduce eye-watering property costs. And many covid restrictions have finally been lifted. It may not be enough.

## Berlin’s International Film Festival

The 73rd Berlinale film festival begins in the German capital on Thursday. Among some 400 screenings, 19 films will vie to win Golden and Silver Bears. Contenders include “Le Grand Chariot” (“The Plough”), by Philippe Garrel, a French director, which tells the story of three generations of puppeteers, a dying profession. In “BlackBerry” Matt Johnson, a young Canadian director, dramatises the rise and fall of the pioneering smartphone-maker. 

But the festival’s reputation is for political art. Thus, “Superpower”, a documentary about Ukraine’s president, [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.economist.com/ukraines-fateful-winter), will have its world premiere at the festival on Friday. Its American directors, Sean Penn and Aaron Kaufman, began the film long before the invasion, intending to document Mr Zelensky’s journey from stand-up comic to head of state. But they were in Kyiv on February 24th 2022 when the Russian army crossed the border, and captured Mr Zelensky’s overnight transformation from besuited politician to combat-fatigue-wearing war hero.
