A federal judge in Florida said he would probably unseal part of the <strong>affidavit </strong>detailing the FBI’s justification for searching <strong>Mar-a-Lago</strong>, Donald Trump’s estate. He gave the agency a week to decide which parts to redact. The FBI has argued that releasing the affidavit would undermine its [investigation](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/17/merrick-garland-is-not-naive-about-political-violence) into whether the former president mishandled classified documents, by dissuading witnesses from co-operating.

<strong>Russia </strong>warned of a man-made disaster at <strong>Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant </strong>in Ukraine, which it captured in March, and threatened to shut it down if shelling continued. That would risk “a radiation disaster at [the largest nuclear power plant](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/03/04/europes-largest-nuclear-plant-shuts-down-after-a-russian-attack) in Europe”, said Energoatom, a Ukrainian nuclear company. António Guterres, the UN’s secretary-general, likened it to “suicide”. On Thursday Russia’s foreign ministry rejected international calls to demilitarise the surrounding area.

The office of [Indonesia’s president](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/21/why-indonesia-punches-below-its-weight-in-global-affairs) said that <strong>Xi Jinping </strong>and <strong>Vladimir Putin </strong>are to attend a summit of the <strong>G20</strong> in Bali in November. The <em>Wall Street Journal </em>had reported that <strong>Joe Biden </strong>might meet China’s president in South-East Asia at about the same time—though it is hard to picture Mr Biden going anywhere near his Russian counterpart. Mr Xi has not left China since the earliest days of the pandemic.

<strong>Xiao Jianhua</strong>, a Chinese-Canadian billionaire financier, was sentenced to 13 years in prison by a <strong>Chinese court</strong>, on charges of bribing officials to evade financial scrutiny as well as illegally obtaining public deposits and breaching trust. His company, believed to have links to high-ranking politicians, was fined a record sum of 55bn yuan ($8.1bn). Mr Xiao, seized from a Hong Kong hotel room in 2017, was [tried behind closed doors](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/07/07/what-a-tycoons-trial-says-about-the-rot-in-chinas-financial-system) in July.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

The man accused of stabbing <strong>Salman Rushdie</strong>, a decorated novelist, pled not guilty to second-degree attempted murder. Hadi Matar was detained without bail at a court hearing in Chautauqua, upstate New York. Sir Salman, who has long been an assassination target for certain Muslims who believe [his work](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/08/15/salman-rushdie-is-a-champion-of-imagination-ambiguity-and-liberty) to be blasphemous, was attacked before giving a lecture last week.

Having sprung 360% this month, the share price of <strong>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond</strong>, a home-supply chain, went spinning down the plughole on Thursday, shedding 45% of its value in after-hours trading. Its stonking ascent had been propelled by r/wallstreetbets, the message-board that wreaked joyful havoc with “[memestocks](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/02/06/what-the-favourite-stocks-of-r/wallstreetbets-have-in-common)” like GameStop and AMC in early 2021. The lone investor who started the run on BBBY still holds the largest stake in GameStop.

The longtime chief financial officer of <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> <strong>real-estate business</strong>, Allen Weisselberg, pled guilty to 15 tax-related [felony charges](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/05/19/what-are-the-legal-troubles-facing-donald-trump) filed by New York’s attorney-general. He agreed to testify if called at a separate trial against the Trump Organisation. The plea deal means he could serve five months in prison, rather than up to 15 years. Prosecutors alleged that Mr Weisselberg evaded paying tax on perks, such as a rent-free apartment and school tuition for his grandchildren.

## Mike Pence’s barnstorming

The Iowa state fair is a rite of passage for presidential hopefuls. In campaign years candidates and the hacks covering them flock to the event. Once there they consume calorific inventions served on sticks and glad-handle voters ahead of Iowa’s nominating contest, which comes first in the presidential-election cycle. The next presidential election is not until 2024, yet on Friday Mike Pence, Donald Trump’s former vice-president, will make an appearance in Des Moines. 

He comes to Iowa’s capital straight from New Hampshire, another early-voting state, where he told attendees at an event that Republicans should stop attacking the FBI over its [raid of his former boss’s estate](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/17/merrick-garland-is-not-naive-about-political-violence). He also said he would consider testifying before congressional investigators probing the Capitol riot on January 6th 2021. Mr Pence appears to have completely fallen out with Mr Trump; his itinerary suggests he may well covet the presidency for himself. Does presidential-campaign season now start before the mid-terms have even finished?

## Russian-Israeli relations in the dock

Lawyers for the Jewish Agency for Israel, an international organisation which acts on behalf of the Israeli government, are fighting to continue its presence in Russia. At their own request, their appearance before a Russian court on Friday was postponed at the last minute. The Kremlin accuses the JA, which helps Jews move to Israel, of illegally collecting the personal information of Russian citizens.

The accusation seems to be a warning to Israel to[ remain neutral](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/07/28/israels-russian-conundrum) on the war in Ukraine—a position partly owing to its own large Russian-speaking population. But the country’s prime minister, Yair Lapid, condemned Russia’s invasion before he took office in July. The scale of emigration since the start of the war suggests that many Jews agree with Mr Lapid. The JA reckons that around 20,500 Russian Jews have moved to Israel since March, over 12% of Russia’s estimated Jewish population. The Kremlin may succeed in shutting down the JA. But that will not convince other Jews to stay in Russia.

## South Korea and Japan court disaster

Yoon Suk-yeol has historic ambitions for his country’s relationship with neighbouring Japan. On August 17th South Korea’s president said that [the two countries’ enmity](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2019/09/03/why-japan-and-south-korea-bicker), stemming from Japan’s colonial rule over Korea from 1910 to 1945, could be swept aside “amicably and promptly”. His enthusiasm is understandable—a bit of bonhomie could make both countries [richer and more secure](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/07/south-korea-and-japan-have-a-rare-chance-to-make-friends), especially in the face of rising tensions in the region.

His optimism makes less sense. The path to rapprochement is long and treacherous, and the journey could end almost before it has begun. In 2018 South Korea’s courts approved the seizure of assets from certain Japanese companies, on the basis that Koreans had been forced to toil on their behalf during the second world war. The liquidated assets would be given to the victims. The companies refused to pay, but the court’s final [decision](https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/12/22/japanese-firms-resist-compensating-forced-wartime-labourers-from-korea) may come as early as Friday. Forcing the firms to pay up will enrage Japan, and will probably put paid to Mr Yoon’s aspirations.

## Stasi assassins, synths and a suitcase

“Kleo” is intense—and brutal—from the off. Set after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the series, released on Netflix on Friday, follows Kleo Straub, a fictional former Stasi assassin. She embarks on a mission to settle scores, deploying disguises, dark humour and outlandish fashion choices that will remind many viewers of the BBC’s “Killing Eve”. 

Feminist revenge dramas are in vogue. They can seem repetitive, but “Kleo” attempts to differentiate itself with a historical twist. The show explores the contrasts between east and west Germany in the post-Soviet era and is infused with real events and people, such as Erich Mielke, the Stasi chief. There is also a suitcase full of clues, for the spy-drama addicts. It is a novel way into a subgenre that every streaming company wants a slice of. And Netflix could do with a boost: it lost nearly 1m subscribers in the three months to July, the biggest drop in the company’s history.

## A deadly toll for aid workers

Wherever there is conflict, there are people who run to help. Being an aid worker in unstable or violent regions always carries risks, but 2021 was the deadliest year in nearly a decade for humanitarian staff. According to data from Humanitarian Outcomes, a consultancy in London, 141 were killed. 

On Friday the UN will mark World Humanitarian Day with a campaign to raise awareness about the rising toll on aid workers. Despite there being fewer violent incidents in 2021 compared with the previous two years, the 268 reported attacks, mostly shootings and airstrikes, resulted in more deaths, and 117 people were kidnapped.

South Sudan remains the most dangerous place in the world for aid workers. Afghanistan comes second, despite a [dip in overall violence](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/08/15/violence-in-afghanistan-has-dropped-under-the-taliban) since the Taliban returned to power. With war now raging in Ukraine, this year could be even worse for humanitarians.
