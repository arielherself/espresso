<strong>Russia</strong> pressed on with its offensive in several areas of <strong>Ukraine</strong>, having bombarded it with unusual severity over the weekend. Russian forces pounded Nikopol, a city near [Zaporizhia](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/19/what-is-at-stake-at-ukraines-zaporizhia-nuclear-plant), and fired cruise missiles into [Odessa](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/05/27/why-is-odessa-important-to-both-ukraine-and-russia). The EU’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, rejected calls from member states bordering Russia, including Estonia and Finland, for a blanket ban on tourist visas for Russians travelling to the Schengen area. He advocated a “more selective” approach ahead of talks planned for next week.

<strong>Anthony Fauci</strong>, the [chief medical adviser](https://www.economist.com/films/2022/04/26/dr-fauci-follow-the-science) to the American president, said he would step down from that role, and from his job as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The 81-year old infectious diseases expert was the face of the American government’s efforts to contain the covid-19 pandemic.

<strong>Germany’s economy</strong> is increasingly likely to slip into recession with inflation rising above 10% this autumn, according to the country’s Bundesbank. The euro zone’s largest economy is highly reliant on <strong>Russian gas supplies</strong>, which will again be choked off in a three-day closure of the [Nord Stream 1 pipeline](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter) next week. Dutch TTF prices, a key benchmark for Europe’s wholesale gas price, jumped by 20% to above €290 per MWh.

<strong>Elon Musk</strong> has subpoenaed the co-founder and former CEO of <strong>Twitter</strong>, Jack Dorsey, as part of his attempt to tear up a deal in which he agreed to buy the social media network for $44bn. Mr Musk [backed out](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/11/with-or-without-elon-musk-twitter-is-overdue-a-shake-up) of the agreement in July, accusing Twitter of misrepresenting the number of bot and spam accounts on its platform. The two sides have since sued each other over the fate of the deal; a trial is set to begin in October.

<strong>Turkey </strong>doubled its imports of <strong>Russian oil</strong> this year, according to Refinitiv, a financial-data provider. Imports rose to over 200,000 barrels per day so far in 2022, compared with 98,000 in the same period of 2021. Trade between the [two countries](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/04/07/how-turkey-is-courting-russias-oligarchs) has grown rapidly since Turkey elected not to join Western sanctions against Russia, citing its reliance on Russian energy.

Thousands of <strong>Haitians </strong>marched through the capital Port-Au-Prince demanding the resignation of prime minister Ariel Henry and an end to [rising poverty](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/02/05/foreign-aid-has-done-little-to-help-haiti) and violence. Police fired tear gas to quell the protest, during which a demonstrator was killed by an unidentified gunman. Annual inflation is now 29% in the Caribbean nation and some basic food prices have more than quadrupled. Gang violence and kidnappings have also increased.

<strong>Ford </strong>said it would cut 3,000 jobs in September, mostly in America, Canada and India. The move is part of a restructuring and money-saving strategy as the car manufacturer shifts its focus to electric vehicles and batteries; its CEO, Jim Farley, said his workforce was ill-equipped to handle the transition. Ford [reckons](https://www.economist.com/business/ford-and-general-motors-fight-it-out-to-electrify/21805099) that 40% of its global sales will be electric by 2030.

## America and South Korea back in full battle rattle

On Monday America and South Korea began [full-scale joint military drills](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/08/18/america-and-south-korea-restart-their-big-military-drills) for the first time in five years. In 2018 Donald Trump, then America’s president, had called for an end to the exercises as he courted Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s leader, who resented them. But those were different times. America and North Korea were talking to one another, and South Korea’s doveish then-president, Moon Jae-in, was keen for inter-Korean rapprochement. Reality has since set in. North Korea [is back to developing weapons](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/04/07/north-korea-is-testing-icbms-again-nuclear-weapons-may-be-next) openly, while America and South Korea warn of “strong and firm” action, if need be.

The drills mark a return to the status quo. They are designed to test readiness for an attack; to reassure the South Koreans they are safe; and to dissuade the North Koreans from trying anything too bold. At the very least, expect the normal North Korean reaction: fiery words to match its enemies’ live-fire exercises.

## Cloak-and-daggers drawn for Greek politicians

Greece’s lawmakers returned from summer break on Monday to discuss a demand by Alexis Tsipras, the leader of the left-wing opposition, for a parliamentary probe into the activities of the national intelligence service, EYP. It stands accused of hacking into the phones of politicians and [journalists](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/05/19/rows-over-press-freedom-overshadow-greeces-recent-achievements). The scandal could topple the government. The conservative prime minister, [Kyriakos Mitsotakis](https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/05/22/how-greece-became-europes-unlikely-model-student), will be pressed to explain why EYP, which he oversees personally, was eavesdropping on Nikos Androulakis, a member of the European Parliament, while he campaigned for the leadership of a small socialist party. 

Meanwhile the European Parliament’s spyware watchdog, PEGA, wants Greece to investigate Intellexa, the Athens-based, Israeli-owned maker of Predator, a spyware system that was used in another, unsuccessful attack on Mr Androulakis’s phone. Predator was also detected lurking in a Greek journalist’s phone. Mr Mitsotakis claims that he was unaware of EYP’s surveillance of Mr Androulakis and that Greece’s government does not possess Predator.

## Africa’s many health problems

This week scores of officials, ministers and other bigwigs descend on Lomé, Togo’s capital, for an annual World Health Organisation conference about the state of health in Africa. The past two sessions had to be held virtually. This year the four-day pow-wow includes a session on how countries have maintained essential health services while fighting covid-19. Yet the pandemic is just one of many items on the agenda.

The health ministers have a myriad of problems to consider, from sickle-cell disease to tuberculosis; African countries have some of the highest rates in the world. Polio, non-communicable diseases and mental health will also be in focus. Most of the continent’s health ministries are short on resources and struggle with unenviable decisions about how to prioritise covid-19 vaccinations relative to perennial needs, such as jabs against tetanus and measles. And with just 22% of Africans fully vaccinated against covid-19, another wave could force priorities to change quickly.

## Zoom’s shrinking earnings

Today Zoom, a videoconferencing service, will report its second-quarter results. The firm’s popularity soared during the pandemic, but now it faces emboldened competitors, such as Microsoft Teams. Another problem is that demand for Zoom’s services is waning as more workers return to the office. Its operating margins declined from 32% in last year’s first quarter to 17% this year. Investors took heed. Zoom’s share price has fallen by 46% since the start of the year, against a 17% decline across the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index.

Yet remote work has survived. Some 58% of America’s employees say they work from home at least some of the time. But firms that benefited during the pandemic’s heyday are now suffering. Consider Peloton, which makes internet-connected exercise bikes; Netflix, a video-streaming service; and DocuSign, an electronic-signatures firm. Each of their share prices has fallen by more than 50% this year. The buzz around remote-work stocks has all but worn off.

## Making jet fuel green

Air-travel emissions are notorious—and hard to do without. Batteries show promise for powering short-range flights, but decarbonising longer journeys is much harder.

The solution may be[ sustainable aviation fuel](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/08/17/ways-to-make-aviation-fuel-green), a “drop-in” replacement for the conventional stuff. Innovators are working on various ways to produce SAF. Some use discarded cooking oil and animal fats. Others start with plant matter left over from forestry and agriculture. Still others turn carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and then combine that with hydrogen to create hydrocarbons. Some are even trying to engineer single-celled algae to produce fuels directly.

For now, SAF is about three times as costly as ordinary jet fuel. Even so, airlines have undertaken 450,000 flights with SAF in the fuselage. With the industry aiming to become carbon-neutral by 2050, that number is set to soar. Someday even the most environmentally finicky passenger may board aircraft with a clean conscience.
