The committee [investigating the assault](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/10/congresss-capitol-riot-hearing-confirms-donald-trumps-complicity) on <strong>America’s Capitol</strong> in 2021 released its final report, blaming the attack on “one man”—<strong>Donald Trump</strong>. The former president is accused of carrying out “a multi-part plan to overturn the 2020 presidential election”. The report’s release is the culmination of an 18-month-long investigation and comes days after the committee recommended that Mr Trump be charged with federal crimes.

Three people were killed, and four injured, by a gunman who opened fire in central <strong>Paris</strong>. Witnesses said the attacker seemed to be targeting a Kurdish community centre. One suspect, aged 69, was detained by police. The man had previously been arrested for attacking tents in a migrant camp.

<strong>North Korea </strong>denied supplying arms to [the Wagner Group](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/03/07/what-is-the-wagner-group-russias-mercenary-organisation), a<strong> Russian</strong> mercenary organisation fighting in <strong>Ukraine</strong>. John Kirby, the <strong>White House</strong>’s national-security spokesman, said that, “North Korea has completed an initial arms delivery to Wagner, which paid for that equipment”. Wagner, run by a close associate of Vladimir Putin, is estimated to be spending $100m per month in Ukraine.

<strong>Inflation</strong> in <strong>Japan</strong> rose to a four-decade high in November. The core consumer price index, which excludes food prices, increased by 3.7% year on year, well above the Bank of Japan’s target of 2%. Meanwhile, on Friday the cabinet approved a budget that will increase [defence spending](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/12/12/east-asias-big-beasts-are-getting-on-badly) by $51.4bn in 2023, amid rising threats from China, North Korea and Russia.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Meta</strong>, Facebook’s parent company, agreed to pay $725m to settle a class-action lawsuit in America, which accused the social-media platform of allowing third parties, including <strong>Cambridge Analytica</strong>, a British consultancy, to access users’ data. The plaintiffs’ lawyers said the settlement is the largest ever obtained in a data-privacy class-action suit in America. The settlement still needs to be approved by a federal judge in San Francisco.

<strong>ByteDance </strong>sacked four employees who accessed user data of two journalists on <strong>TikTok</strong>, the social-media platform it owns. The employees had been investigating leaks of company information to the press. The revelation will increase America’s [security concerns](https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2022/07/09/the-all-conquering-quaver) about TikTok’s user data. Earlier this week the Senate passed a bill banning the app from all government devices.

<strong>America</strong>’s Senate passed a<strong> $1.7trn spending bill</strong> to finance federal agencies until next September and provide further [aid to Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/12/21/volodymyr-zelensky-brings-his-message-to-washington). The bill must now go to the House of Representatives for a final vote before being signed by President Joe Biden. Lawmakers are rushing to get the legislation through before midnight on Friday, when current funding will run out and trigger a partial government shutdown.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 6m, the number of people that the Saudi Arabian government wants to attend the <em>haj</em>, the Muslim pilgrimage, each year by 2030.

## 2022 in review: Another slow year for climate progress

<em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, science and technology</em>

Climate action in 2022 has been largely [disappointing](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/10/27/few-governments-have-done-much-about-the-climate-this-year). A UN report found that a mere 0.5bn tonnes have been shaved off last year’s gap of 17bn-20bn tonnes between where the annual rate of carbon-dioxide emissions would need to be in 2030 to offer a decent chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures, and what is implicit in political promises. At [COP27](https://www.economist.com/international/2022/11/20/a-new-un-fund-for-loss-and-damage-emerges-from-cop27), the UN’s climate talks, hosted this year in Egypt, commitments on fossil fuels were no stronger than last time around, in Glasgow in 2021.

But the summit may have tipped the balance of debate on “[loss and damage](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/03/what-is-climate-loss-and-damage)”—the idea that rich countries will pay poor ones to help them deal with damage caused by immediate climate-related disasters. And in December a deal was struck at COP15, [the UN’s biodiversity summit](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/12/09/why-is-there-another-cop-happening), to protect 30% of the planet’s land and sea for wildlife by 2030. Now countries face the far harder task of implementing their promises.

## 2022 in review: The spectre of covid-19

<em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, science and technology</em>

For many in the West covid-19 has finally begun to fade from view this year—and more is being revealed about how it has changed public health. Efforts put into rapidly producing effective vaccines and tests could transform approaches to the treatment of other diseases, such as [tuberculosis](https://www.economist.com/international/2022/10/27/how-one-pandemic-made-another-one-worse). Moreover, scientists’ success in tracking covid-19 in cities’ sewers has renewed interest in the ways [wastewater](https://www.economist.com/international/2022/09/07/how-covid-19-spurred-governments-to-snoop-on-sewage) can help to monitor other illnesses.

The pandemic’s deadly consequences are becoming clearer, too. While the official global death toll stands around 6.6m, <em>The Economist</em>’s [model](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-estimates) puts the true number of excess deaths around three times as high, 20.6m by early December. And the economic and political costs of the virus continue to be felt, especially in China, where a zero-covid policy recently sparked rare [protests](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/12/01/lessons-from-a-chinese-protest). The authorities have now largely ditched the policy, [unleashing](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/12/13/how-chinese-people-are-dealing-with-the-spread-of-covid-19) a wave of cases across a population almost entirely new to the virus. For some, the pandemic’s shadow still looks dark indeed.

## 2022 in review: Making strides towards a circular economy

<em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, science and technology</em>

The “gigafactories”, in which [batteries](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/10/26/gigafactories-are-recycling-old-ev-batteries-into-new-ones) for electric vehicles are made are in the vanguard of an economic revolution. Battery-makers increasingly pursue “circular manufacturing”, a long-held dream in which firms make new products by recycling their old ones, thus reducing their environmental footprints. Sweden’s Northvolt, for instance, aims to obtain half its raw materials, including lithium and cobalt, from recycled batteries by 2030.

The challenges are complex. A lot of cobalt, for example, comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where many mining operations use child labour. Northvolt and other battery-makers try to trace the origin of materials and check the standards with which they are produced to avoid buying supplies from nefarious outfits. And one day they hope to source lithium closer to home than Australia or Chile, reducing the distance travelled by materials too. Gigafactories are not yet exemplars of the [circular economy](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/27/battery-makers-are-powering-a-circular-economy), but they are laying a path for other industries to follow.

## 2022 in review: How the James Webb Space Telescope is changing astronomy

<em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, science and technology</em>

In July the first images emerged from the[ James Webb Space Telescope](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/07/11/the-james-webb-space-telescope-opens-for-business), the largest space telescope ever built. One of their subjects was the “Cosmic Cliffs”—stunning, textured peaks of dust and gas in the Carina nebula. The JWST’s predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope, snapped the same region in 2005. But the difference between the vistas could not be more striking. The JWST had already spotted baby stars among the peaks that no previous observatory could see.

The JWST was launched on Christmas Day 2021, after 11 years of delays and at a cost of $9.7bn. It has given astronomers their [most powerful tool yet](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/29/how-is-the-james-webb-space-telescope-changing-astronomy) for scanning the cosmos in infrared frequencies of light. That will let them study many things they have struggled to examine in the past—in particular, the formation of stars and planets, from the universe’s youth to the present day. There will be a lengthy queue of astronomers eager to explore its startling potential.
