The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog left the <strong>Zaporizhia nuclear plant</strong> in Russian-occupied territory in southern Ukraine. Five inspectors will remain at the facility for several more days. The UN aims to set up a permanent monitor at the power station, which has been the [site of intense shelling](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/19/what-is-at-stake-at-ukraines-zaporizhia-nuclear-plant) in recent weeks. Ukraine hopes the inspection will lead to the “demilitarising” of the plant but Russia says it will not withdraw its forces.

Russia’s President <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> will not attend the funeral of <strong>Mikhail Gorbachev</strong>, the Soviet Union’s last leader, who died on Tuesday. A Kremlin spokesman blamed Mr Putin’s work schedule but said the government was involved in organising Saturday’s ceremony. Mr [Gorbachev](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/31/mikhail-gorbachev-liberated-millions-even-if-he-didnt-set-out-to) presided over the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, something Mr Putin has described as the “greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century”.

<strong>Russia </strong>said it would stop selling <strong>oil</strong> to countries that impose a price cap on its oil exports. On Friday the G7 is expected to back a proposal to cap the price of Russian oil, preventing firms from financing or insuring Russian shipments if the sale price exceeds the cap. America suggested the idea out of concern that a total insurance ban, which Britain and the European Union [intend to implement in December](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/24/western-sanctions-will-eventually-impair-russias-economy), would send prices rocketing.

The chairman of <strong>Lukoil</strong>, Russia’s second-largest oil producer, fell to his death from a hospital window in Moscow. A law-enforcement official said Ravil Maganov committed suicide, though several of his associates told Reuters that it was unlikely he took his own life. It is at least the third <strong>reported suicide</strong> of an executive with ties to Russia’s oil industry since February.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

Poland will demand <strong>reparations</strong> from <strong>Germany</strong> for an estimated $1.32trn of losses caused during world war two, said the leader of the country’s ruling party. The figure published in a long-awaited report tops an earlier estimate of $850bn in 2019. Some 6m Poles, 3m of whom were Jewish, were killed during the war and Warsaw, the capital, was razed. Germany has argued that it has resolved all financial claims related to its invasion.

Clashes between Shia militants in Basra, <strong>Iraq,</strong> left four people dead, according to local security officials, the latest in a spate of recent violence in the country. Supporters of Muqtada al-Sadr, an influential Shia cleric, have been fighting with rival factions. [Iraq](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/31/iraqs-political-deadlock-turns-violent) has been in political deadlock since Mr Sadr’s party won the most seats in elections last year, but could not form a government.

<strong>Chinese</strong> officials support a proposal for people to quarantine in <strong>Hong Kong</strong> before crossing to the mainland, according to John Lee, Hong Kong’s leader. Mr Lee said a task force will work out the details of the “reverse quarantine” system. Meanwhile, some 21m people will be confined to their homes in <strong>Chengdu</strong>, a city in central China, after it imposed a lockdown on Thursday. It is the largest city-wide lockdown in China since Shanghai’s in April. All businesses will shut except for hospitals, pharmacies and supermarkets.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>$465m, the rumoured price tag of “The Rings of Power”, a new drama based on the “Lord of the Rings” books. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/08/21/game-of-thrones-v-lord-of-the-rings-a-tale-of-old-v-new-hollywood).

## Russia rallies its troops for war games

Russian troops are in short supply, with the Kremlin [struggling to find sufficient men](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/08/25/ukraine-and-russia-both-need-more-soldiers) to send into harm’s way in Ukraine. But that has not stopped the Russian army from scraping together enough soldiers for a week-long joint exercise. The quadrennial <em>Vostok </em>(East) war games, in Russia’s eastern military district, which includes Siberia, begins on Thursday. It will supposedly include 50,000 military personnel, 140 aircraft and 60 ships, though Russia has been known to exaggerate these figures. 

The involvement of China and a dozen other countries, including India, is a gratifying sign of diplomatic solidarity for the Kremlin. Russia’s Pacific Fleet will conduct drills with China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy in the Sea of Japan, building on their first ever joint patrol in October. But China is [more circumspect](https://www.economist.com/china/chinas-friendship-with-russia-has-boundaries-despite-what-their-leaders-say/21808197) where it counts: Russia’s requests for arms and ammunition to be deployed in Ukraine have come to naught.

## An EU embassy in Silicon Valley

On Thursday the European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, opens its first office in San Francisco—a diplomatic mission of sorts to work with Silicon Valley’s firms. It is a timely move, as the EU prepares to enforce the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act, two [ambitious new laws for the internet](https://www.economist.com/business/2020/12/15/the-eu-unveils-its-plan-to-rein-in-big-tech) approved by the European Parliament in July. Gerard de Graaf, a senior Eurocrat who oversaw the drafting of the legislation, will head the San Francisco office. 

Whether he will be treated as the EU’s plenipotentiary is another question. Firms like Alphabet, Apple and Meta (née Facebook) may prefer to deal directly with Brussels, where each employs hordes of lobbyists. At any rate, the new office formalises what has been a reality for some time. In many ways, tech titans are much like big virtual nations and need to be dealt with as such. That includes maintaining diplomatic relations.

## Bar fight in India

Delhi’s muggy monsoon season leaves many craving a drink, but finding one in India’s capital has become difficult. For the past month most of its privately run booze stores have been shut as national officials pursue a corruption probe into the city’s new alcohol policy. On Thursday sales resumed, but only in government-run shops. That will be a relief for tipplers, but a disappointment for the Aam Aadmi Party, which runs Delhi’s city government and is emerging as a significant opposition force to the [Bharatiya Janata Party](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/03/12/narendra-modis-party-triumphs-in-indias-bellwether-state), India’s ruling party.

The AAP had hoped that allowing private stores to [sell alcohol](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/04/28/how-liquor-shops-are-getting-around-indias-latest-booze-ban) and introducing a new excise policy would clean up the businesses and yield more in tax. But the BJP accused AAP leaders of benefiting personally from privatisation, prompting a U-turn. The AAP is taking the fight outside. Arvind Kejriwal, the party’s leader, has accused the BJP of corruption and promoting “spurious” (ie, lethal, illegal) liquor in Gujarat, a western state where booze is banned—and elections are due in December. 

## Meta closes its crypto wallet

Facebook’s parent company, Meta, is giving up on its cryptocurrency business. Things were already looking bumpy in January, when Diem, a much-scrutinised cryptocurrency backed by Facebook and formerly known as Libra, sold its assets for $182m. On Thursday Novi, Facebook’s cryptocurrency wallet, will be folded away less than a year after its launch. That is because the once-lucrative coins lost their shine after a [severe crypto market downturn](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/23/three-mechanisms-for-crypto-contagion) this summer. 

Also, Meta’s profits from its money-spinning [advertising business are slipping](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/28/the-online-ad-industry-is-being-shaken-up) as its user base stagnates and competition from TikTok stiffens. Facebook is thus re-focusing on the hype of the [metaverse](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/07/27/in-the-metaverse-matthew-ball-explains-where-the-idea-came-from) (hence its new company name). Novi is not the only initiative affected. Next month, the American company will close its standalone gaming app, which failed to take on Twitch, Amazon’s video game-streaming giant. Until Meta can revive its ads business or make money from the metaverse, other side projects will be at risk of the chop too. 

## Australia needs its migrants back

Australia depends on immigrants more than most rich countries: almost one-third of its population of 26m was born overseas. But it now needs more, after an estimated 600,000 immigrants who would have moved to Australia were kept out by pandemic lockdowns, according to CEDA, an economic think-tank. Australia reopened its borders in February, but unemployment stands at just 3.4% and companies are struggling to find staff. On Thursday the Labor government, which [took office in May](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/05/22/what-australias-new-government-will-do), meets unions and business lobbies to discuss the tight labour market.

The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, may boost the annual quota for permanent migrants from 160,000 to 200,000. Such moves are uncontroversial down under, where work visas are carefully distributed under a points-based system that balances openness with selectivity. But a visa-processing backlog means that immigrants will not return as quickly as Australia would like. It will be at least 2024 before the numbers are back.
