Zhejiang, a province in eastern<strong> China</strong>, reported 1m new daily <strong>covid-19</strong> infections, as the country grapples with a surge in cases. Nearly 250m people may have been infected in the first 20 days of December, according to the country’s health authority. The estimate is [far higher](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/12/15/our-model-shows-that-chinas-covid-death-toll-could-be-massive) than the official reported figure. Despite reports of overcrowded morgues, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention also said there were no covid deaths in the five days to Saturday. Hospitals in several provinces said that rising cases were causing blood shortages.

Vladimir Putin, <strong>Russia’s</strong> president, said that he was ready to negotiate with [<strong>Ukraine</strong>](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/12/20/our-country-of-the-year-for-2022-can-only-be-ukraine) and others over [the war](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/12/20/a-ukrainian-city-celebrates-despite-the-cold-and-the-russians) that he started–even as Russia continues to bombard civilians and infrastructure in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials dismissed Mr Putin’s comments as lip service. William Burns, director of the CIA, has also said that Russia is not serious about talks.

An estimated 1m <strong>Americans</strong> were without electricity for Christmas Day, as the effects of an <strong>extreme winter storm</strong> continued to be felt across the country. Some 200m people were affected and a dozen states announced emergency measures. Meteorologists said a <strong>“bomb cyclone”⁠</strong>—a storm that rapidly intensifies—⁠⁠had developed over the Great Lakes region.

Three international aid organisations said they were suspending operations in <strong>Afghanistan </strong>after <strong>the Taliban</strong> barred women from working for NGOs. Save the Children, the Norwegian Refugee Council and CARE said they cannot effectively reach people in need without women in their workforce. [The Taliban](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/12/05/life-under-the-taliban-has-hit-rock-bottom) have grown increasingly repressive since returning to power in August 2021: earlier women were banned from attending university, sparking protests across the country.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Iran’s</strong> Supreme Court commuted the death sentence of Saman Seydi Yasin, a rapper involved in [anti-government protests](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/04/irans-rattled-government-may-be-backing-down) that have rocked the country since September. Mr Yasin had been convicted in a sham trial of attempting to kill security forces. Two protesters have been executed this month, and the court upheld the death sentence for Mohammad Qobadloo, who was convicted, also in a sham trial, of killing a police officer.

For a second day protesters clashed with police in <strong>Paris</strong>, following the murder of three people, and injury to several more, by a gunman who had targeted a Kurdish community centre on Friday. The suspect, aged 69, had previously been arrested for attacking a migrant camp. Gérald Darmanin, the interior minister, said that the gunman was “clearly targeting foreigners”.

Around 1,000 soldiers and 130 police officers were deployed in a Christmas Eve raid against drug dealers in <strong>El Salvador</strong>. Security forces arrested 23 people and seized $10,000 in cash along with packages of drugs. Nayib Bukele, the president, has cracked down on gangs, but sometimes at the expense of [innocent people](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/04/30/el-salvadors-president-has-locked-up-19000-people-in-a-month).

<strong>Word of the week:</strong> <em>sa bo de, </em>meaning “three knives” in Wenzhounese, referring to the industries in which people from Wenzhou have made their mark on Europe.

## Our books of the year

<em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, culture</em>

“Confidence Man”, a chronicle of the life and lies of the 45th president of the United States, from outer-borough brat to White House bully, was one of our favourite books of 2022. As was “The Age of the Strongman”, also about Donald Trump—as well as his contemporaries, including Xi Jinping and Muhammad bin Salman. 

In business, try “Money Men”, Dan McCrum’s dramatic story of the demise of Wirecard, once one of Europe’s brightest tech stars. Or pick up “Chip War”, a timely guide to semiconductors that details the economic, geopolitical and technological forces shaping an essential industry. 

For lighter fare, 2022 offered some illuminating biographies, including one on Agatha Christie. Alternatively, tuck into some fiction, such as “The Candy House”, a novel about what humans lose in offering up their private lives to algorithms that mine them for profit—a kind of 21st-century “Middlemarch”.

## Viral sauces and Ukrainian desserts: 2022’s recipes

<em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, culture</em>

The book of Ecclesiastes says that “there is no new thing under the sun”. That remains largely true in the kitchen. But modern chefs have something that cooks of old did not: social media. Many people turn to TikTok, a video-sharing app, for “food hacks” and similar recipe-like instructions. This year “[pink sauce](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/25/pink-sauce-and-the-fashion-for-homemade-food-in-america)”, a concoction containing dragon fruit, garlic, lemon juice and milk, became popular. Then allegations emerged that bottles of the stuff blew up in transit and lacked proper preservatives. It is a reminder that recipes can start out viral—and end up bacterial.

Still, microbes are not always an enemy. In Japan <em>koji—</em>a mould grown on cooked grains—has been used for centuries to make miso. Its popularity has recently grown, and “Koji Alchemy: Rediscovering the Magic of Mould-Based Fermentation”, released in 2022, offered an extensive guide. Elsewhere, Russia’s invasion sparked justified interest in Ukrainian culture, including its diverse and unique cuisine. Olia Hercules, a Ukrainian chef, has [an enticing recipe for a wintry day](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/12/09/the-year-in-food-ten-recipes-for-2022): poppy-seed strudel studded with nuts and apples.

## The best film and TV in 2022

<em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, culture</em>

The [best television](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/12/02/the-best-television-series-of-2022) of 2022 included series about chefs, comedians and washed-up spies. In the third season of “Barry”, Bill Hader plays an assassin who takes up amateur dramatics. “Slow Horses”, a welcome addition to the well-trodden genre of British espionage dramas, mixes serious stakes with cynical humour. And “The Bear” depicts the gulf between the hierarchical world of haute cuisine and a disorderly sandwich shop in Chicago (to which the protagonist returns after his brother’s death). 

Our favourite films are similarly varied. Some Hollywood blockbusters were a delight. “Everything Everywhere All at Once” was an ambitious, unpredictable, sci-fi kung-fu action comedy. But “RRR”, a Telugu-language epic, proved to audiences around the world that Indian films could be as action-packed, entertaining and excessive as anything produced in Los Angeles. [Our full list](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/23/the-best-films-of-2022) also includes French, Iranian, Irish and Swedish movies.

## The best podcasts of 2022

<em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, culture</em>

Some of our favourite podcasts this year had a common theme: American democracy. “The Run-Up”, a show by the <em>New York Times</em>, was a clear-eyed reflection on America’s recent political history ahead of the midterm elections. “Will be Wild” asked what drew rioters to the Capitol building on January 6th 2021. 

Other standouts looked at less well-trodden stories. “Wild Boys” detailed the intriguing tale of two emaciated boys who walked out of a forest in British Columbia in 2003. They had grown up among the trees, they said, largely untouched by civilisation. “Can I Tell You a Secret?” is just as gripping, but far more chilling. It told the story of Matthew Hardy, a British cyber-stalker, who harassed at least 62 women—yet was not convicted for more than a decade. [Our full list](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/25/the-best-podcasts-of-2022) of recommendations includes shows about climate change in Miami and an exploration of why people host dinner parties.
