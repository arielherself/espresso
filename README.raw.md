<strong>Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</strong> won <strong>Brazil’s</strong> knife-edge [presidential run-off](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/10/31/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-will-be-brazils-next-president), with 50.8% of the vote. The leftist former president beat Jair Bolsonaro, the right-wing incumbent, and will be sworn in on January 1st 2023. It is an astonishing comeback: after losing the presidency in 2010, Lula was imprisoned on corruption charges in 2018. Tensions ran high on Sunday after supporters of Lula accused federal police of erecting roadblocks to suppress turnout in some constituencies. Mr Bolsonaro has yet to concede.

<strong>Russia</strong> launched several missile strikes on <strong>Ukraine</strong>, including on the capital Kyiv, causing [electricity and water outages](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/24/ukraine-races-to-stop-russia-from-destroying-its-power-grid), according to Ukrainian officials. Dmytro Kuleba, the foreign minister, tweeted that “critical infrastructure” had been hit and accused Russia of targeting civilians. Separately Britain’s defence ministry said many of Russia’s newly mobilised reservists were poorly equipped, using rifles that were in “barely usable condition”.

<strong>Turkey</strong>, <strong>Ukraine</strong> and the <strong>UN</strong> vowed to press ahead with the Black Sea grain deal, despite [Russia withdrawing](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/30/putin-suspends-a-deal-to-allow-grain-exports-from-ukraine) from the pact. Officials said they would implement a plan that would allow 12 ships to leave Ukrainian ports on Monday. Russia pulled out of the deal after claiming that Ukrainian drones had attacked Russian ships taking part in the initiative. The withdrawal provoked outrage from the West and raised fears of global starvation.

<strong>Italy’s </strong>economy beat expectations in the third quarter, growing 0.5%. Analysts had forecast flat quarterly growth, while officials predicted a drop. ISTAT, the country’s statistics bureau, attributed the rise to an increase in services activity. The reading is a boon for Italy’s new prime minister, [Giorgia Meloni](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/22/giorgia-meloni-and-her-allies-take-power-in-italy), who leads the country’s [most right-wing government](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/27/storm-clouds-loom-for-giorgia-meloni-italys-new-prime-minister) since the second world war.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

The president of <strong>South Korea</strong>, Yoon Suk-yeol, declared a period of national mourning as the death toll from a crush during Halloween celebrations in Seoul, the capital, rose to 154. Another 149 were injured and the city has reportedly received thousands of missing-person reports. Mr Yoon promised an official investigation into the tragedy, which took place in a popular nightlife district.

Videos showed workers fleeing a huge <strong>iPhone-assembly plant</strong> in Zhengzhou, in central China, after the facility was locked down to contain a <strong>covid-19 outbreak</strong>. Reuters reported that the disruption at the factory could result in 30% fewer smartphones being produced there in November. China shows no sign of abandoning its zero-covid policy, despite the [damage to its economy](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/10/13/china-shows-few-signs-of-loosening-its-zero-covid-policy).

At least 141 people died after a <strong>suspension bridge</strong> for pedestrians collapsed into a river in <strong>India’s </strong>western state of Gujarat. The century-old bridge had been closed for renovation for seven months and only reopened to the public a few days before the accident. Officials said they would investigate whether it was inspected properly beforehand.

<strong>Fact of the day</strong>: $1.7trn, the amount President Joe Biden has pledged to spend in bills on infrastructure, semiconductors and the environment over the next decade.

## Affirmative action’s last stand

Since 1978, America’s Supreme Court has allowed the limited use of racial preferences in university admissions to foster the educational benefits of diversity. In 2003 and 2016, legal challenges to affirmative action fell one vote short in the highest court. But on Monday a pair of cases, involving Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, give the justices another opportunity to nix race-conscious admissions. The court’s six Republican-appointed members should be a receptive audience.

Students for Fair Admissions, the plaintiff in both suits, is the brainchild of Edward Blum, a conservative activist who brought the previous cases, too. SFFA argues that <em>Grutter v Bollinger</em>, the 2003 decision, is “egregiously wrong” and must be overturned. Harvard’s tip for black and Hispanic students is not modest but “mammoth”, the organisation says, and “discriminates against Asian Americans”. Harvard counters that its policies “fully align” with the constitutional requirement of equal protection and reflect “common-sense reality, not stereotype”. 

## Ukraine’s grain exports in jeopardy, again

Not a single ship packed with grain and other foodstuffs was able to leave Ukraine on Sunday, after Russia [backed out](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/30/putin-suspends-a-deal-to-allow-grain-exports-from-ukraine) of a deal guaranteeing safe passage for commercial vessels through the Black Sea. Russia announced it was suspending its participation in the UN-brokered agreement “for an indefinite period” on Saturday, in response to a Ukrainian attack on its Black Sea fleet earlier that day. 

Officials from Turkey, Ukraine and the UN insisted they would continue to ship food exports through a transit plan that will send out 12 vessels from Ukrainian ports on Monday. They have good reasons to press ahead. Since early August, when the deal came into effect, Ukraine has been able to export more than 9m tonnes of grain, saving its farmers from bankruptcy. The agreement has also eased a global food shortage, brought down prices and prevented some 100m people from falling into extreme poverty, according to the UN. Its collapse would undo many of those gains. It may also expose Ukraine’s ports, whose waters have been de-mined to allow ships to pass, to new Russian attacks. 

## Some good news for Italy’s new government

Italy’s latest GDP figures showed an unexpectedly strong performance in the third quarter. The economy was reckoned to have grown by 0.5% quarter-on-quarter. Parliament’s budgetary committee had braced for a 0.2% drop. The national statistical office said the preliminary indications pointed to a big boost from services. Italy has benefited from the surge in tourism that has followed the lifting of restrictions imposed during the pandemic.

Today’s figures nevertheless mean that annual growth is down (to 2.6% from 4.9% at the end of the previous quarter). And they reflect only partially the effect of rapidly rising prices. In October, the annual rate of consumer inflation leapt to 12.8% from 9.4% a month earlier. The energy-driven inflation affecting the whole of Europe is among several economic headaches for [Giorgia Meloni’s](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/27/storm-clouds-loom-for-giorgia-meloni-italys-new-prime-minister) newly installed right-wing government. And with Italy already owing more than 150% of GDP, there is a limit to how much she can spend without unsettling investors.

## Hong Kong’s financial summit mired in covid

After more than two years largely sealed off from the outside world, and a violent [crackdown on democracy](https://www.economist.com/interactive/essay/2022/07/01/how-hong-kong-became-a-police-state), Hong Kong’s reputation has taken a beating. But the government hopes to revive its vulnerable status as Asia’s top commercial hub this week with a high-profile summit of global leaders from the finance industry.

The Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit will be a hard sell. Hong Kong is still physically isolated from mainland China as a result of[ zero-covid policies](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/04/16/the-way-chinese-think-about-covid-19-is-changing), threatening its traditional role as a business gateway to the mainland economy. Wall Street bosses are among the attendees, but some will be notable by their absence. Covid-19 diagnoses will keep the head of Citigroup, Jane Fraser, and the president of Blackstone, Jonathan Gray, away. Hong Kong still requires multiple tests for visitors and enforced isolation for those testing positive. Paul Chan, the city’s financial secretary, aims to attend despite having contracted covid on a trip to Saudi Arabia. Zero-covid, it seems, still means lots of covid.

## Meret Oppenheim’s storm in a teacup

Meret Oppenheim was 22 and chatting with Pablo Picasso and Dora Maar in a Paris café when she dreamt up the artwork that would make her famous: a fur-covered cup, saucer and spoon that she called “Object”. Hailed as quintessentially surrealist, this playfully erotic and unnerving sculpture caused a sensation for decades. Yet Oppenheim herself, who died in 1985, has largely escaped notice. 

“Meret Oppenheim: My Exhibition”, a grand survey of more than 180 works at New York’s Museum of Modern Art, should fix this error of omission. The show arrives at a time when curators everywhere have become fascinated again by the Freudian dreamscapes of surrealism, and keen on highlighting the often overlooked work of women. A few years into her star turn as a surrealist, Oppenheim broke free from a movement that often dismissed women as muses, only to continue innovating in semi-obscurity. “Nobody will give you freedom,” she observed. “You have to take it.”
