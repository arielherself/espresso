The Associated Press called the <strong>Arizona </strong>Senate race for Mark Kelly, the Democratic incumbent. The result means the Democrats need to win just one of the two remaining uncalled midterm counts to maintain control of the upper chamber: Nevada remains too close to call while Georgia has gone to a December run-off. Mr Kelly beat Blake Masters, who was endorsed by Donald Trump. The former president’s picks have had [miserable midterms](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/10/after-the-midterms-america-and-its-democracy-look-stronger).

Following its [withdrawal](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/11/09/russia-says-it-is-abandoning-the-ukrainian-city-of-kherson) from the Ukrainian city of Kherson, Russia announced that <strong>Genichesk</strong>, a town 180km away on the Sea of Azov, would become the temporary administrative capital of <strong>Kherson province</strong>. (The province was one of four that Russia annexed in September following fake referendums.) At the same time Ukrainians were taking to the streets of Kyiv and Odessa to celebrate their army’s latest triumph.

<strong>FTX</strong>, until recently one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, filed for Chapter 11 <strong>bankruptcy</strong> after suffering a liquidity crunch. [Sam Bankman-Fried](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/09/the-spectacular-fall-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried), its founder, resigned as chief executive. Earlier in the week Binance, a bigger exchange, withdrew from talks to buy out FTX, which had failed to meet withdrawal requests of up to $8bn. Crypto prices crashed.

<strong>President Joe Biden</strong> told attendees of <strong>COP27</strong> in Egypt that [climate change](https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2022/11/05/the-world-is-going-to-miss-the-totemic-1-5c-climate-target) threatens “the very life of the planet” and promised that America was on track to cut its greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 50% from 2005 levels by 2030. Reactions to Mr Biden’s speech were mixed. Germany’s climate envoy praised his “positive signals”. Other observers criticised his administration’s lack of international climate-finance commitments.

<strong>Twitter </strong>stopped allowing users to [“verify” their account](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/11/03/will-people-pay-8-a-month-for-twitter) for $7.99 per month after a large number impersonated brands and celebrities. The new feature—Elon Musk’s first innovation since taking over the social-media network—was launched on Wednesday and disabled a day later, according to the <em>Washington Post</em>. Mr Musk has said he wants half of Twitter’s revenue to come from paying subscribers rather than advertisers.

The <em>Majestic Princess</em>, a cruise ship owned by Carnival, docked in Sydney after 800 passengers and crew—about 20% of those on board—came down with <strong>covid-19</strong>. The cases are largely mild or asymptomatic, according to the firm. In 2020 a similar outbreak aboard another Carnival ship, the <em>Diamond Princess</em>, resulted in thousands of passengers being [trapped at sea](https://www.economist.com/1843/2020/04/22/the-coronavirus-cruise-on-board-the-diamond-princess) with what was then a much more deadly virus.

<strong>Britain’s</strong> foreign ministry summoned the <strong>Iranian</strong> <em>chargé d’affaires</em> over reports that two British-Iranian journalists in London had received threats from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. Iran International, a Farsi-language news outlet based in Britain, said the police had warned two of its reporters that they faced “imminent, credible and significant risk to their lives” for reporting on [Iran’s protests](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/12/despite-lethal-repression-irans-protests-continue).

## So long, Kherson

After months of moving at a glacial pace, the front lines of the war in Ukraine are now shifting at breakneck speed. Ukrainian forces are rushing forward to fill the apparent vacuum left by Russia’s army on the west bank of the Dnieper river. Russia had announced on Wednesday that it would retreat from the area to save its forces from destruction. 

On Friday Ukrainian troops arrived in the centre of Kherson, [liberating it](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/11/11/russia-claims-to-have-completed-its-withdrawal-from-kherson) after eight months of occupation. They were greeted by cheering locals. The area is thought to have been heavily mined and booby-trapped, so it may be a while before it is fully in Ukraine’s hands. Even so, the seeming speed of Russia’s retreat has taken observers by surprise: some expected it would take days, if not weeks. The Kremlin is trying to insist that the move is a temporary farewell rather than a permanent goodbye. Ukraine’s next target may be Zaporizhia province to the east—part of Russia’s land bridge to Crimea.

## A South-East Asian club struggles for relevance

The ten-country Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) is meeting in Phnom Penh, Cambodia’s capital, until Sunday. This is its first in-person summit since the pandemic. This year’s theme is “Addressing Challenges Together”. The idea is laudable but other-worldly: ASEAN’s challenges are mostly insurmountable. The club has proved incapable of influencing the ruthless junta in Myanmar, an ASEAN member. Nor does it seem able to do much about the growing rivalry in the region [between America and China](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/10/america-and-china-must-talk). 

Still, it counts as a small ASEAN win that President Joe Biden will attend its key forum, the East Asia Summit, on Saturday, before heading to Bali in Indonesia for the G20 (and a meeting with Xi Jinping, his Chinese counterpart). America will be made a “comprehensive strategic partner” of ASEAN, a distinction granted to China a year ago. This will help ASEAN maintain its mantra of “centrality”, staying at least somewhat relevant to the superpowers duking it out.

## A new generation for men’s tennis

​​Tennis aficionados have been awaiting a generational change for years, only to find that young players are unable to dislodge the veteran trio of [Roger Federer](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/09/22/sports-writers-will-miss-roger-federer-as-much-as-his-fans-will), Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. But the baton may well pass this year. Mr Federer retired in September. Mr Nadal and Mr Djokovic this year won their now customary French Open and Wimbledon titles, but the challengers are coming. 

There is already a new world number one, [Carlos Alcaraz](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/05/20/carlos-alcaraz-may-be-the-man-to-usurp-tenniss-big-three-at-last), a 19-year-old Spaniard who was majestic in winning the US Open in September. Twelve months ago Mr Alcaraz won the ATP’s Next Generation event, a short tournament open to the highest-ranked players aged 21 and under. The final of the 2022 event takes place on Saturday. Mr Alcaraz and fellow rising stars Holger Rune and Jannik Sinner are taking a breather, but finalists Brandom Nakashima and Jiri Lehecka look solid bets to become future top-ten players.

## The polka-dot princess in Hong Kong

M+, a contemporary-art museum in Hong Kong, celebrates its first anniversary with a huge retrospective opening on Saturday. “Yayoi Kusama: 1945 to Now” features more than 200 works by the Japanese sculptor and installation artist drawn from museums and private collections in America, Asia and Europe. It explores questions of life and death, and considers how Ms Kusama, now 93, became a cultural icon to fans a quarter her age.

With her pieces regularly fetching more than $1m at auction, “the princess of polka dots” is Japan’s most successful living artist. She created mirrored “Infinity Rooms”, which [draw huge crowds](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/04/15/a-change-in-how-people-consume-contemporary-art-is-under-way) wherever they appear. Famous for her spotted paintings, strawberry-red bob and, as of late, a polka-dot wheelchair, she checked into a psychiatric institution in Tokyo in 1977 and has lived there ever since. With her quirkiness and mass appeal, Ms Kusama, says the chief curator of M+, “is the ultimate outsider and the ultimate insider”.

## Weekend profile: Alaa Abd el-Fattah, Egypt’s prisoner of conscience

In 2011 [Alaa Abd el-Fattah](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/11/09/who-is-alaa-abd-el-fattah) turned 30 in a Cairo jail. He spent his 40th birthday behind bars, too. In fact, the human-rights activist has marked many of life’s milestones from inside a cell: his son’s birth, his father’s death. Again in custody, he is Egypt’s most high-profile [political prisoner](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/07/18/egypt-locks-up-terrorists-but-wont-say-which-terror-group-they-belong-to)—and a source of international embarrassment to its thuggish government.

Egypt had hoped to use COP27, the UN climate conference taking place in Sharm el-Sheikh, to polish its image. But Mr Abd el-Fattah, who recently escalated a months-long hunger strike by refusing water, is making that impossible. America’s president, Joe Biden, raised Mr Abd el-Fattah’s case with his Egyptian counterpart on Friday. Many other leaders and luminaries have called for his release.

Mr Abd el-Fattah was born to Egyptian intellectuals with an activist bent. Imprisonment prevented his father from attending the birth of his daughter, the beginning of a dark family tradition. Mr Abd el-Fattah’s first taste of protest came in 2005, when Egyptians decried election-rigging by the government of Hosni Mubarak, the dictator who ruled from 1981 to 2011. By 2011, when the Arab spring swept the Middle East, Mr Abd el-Fattah had become a leader of Egypt’s uprising. After General Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi helped topple a democratically elected government in 2013 he was arrested again, for allegedly organising against a new law banning protests. He has since spent most of his time in prison.

Mr Abd el-Fattah’s confrontation with the Egyptian regime may now be reaching a climax. In December he received a five-year prison sentence for “undermining national security”. He has been on hunger strike for more than 200 days and has refused water since last weekend. On Thursday his sister said authorities had started a “medical intervention”. The government is happy to let him die, she insisted, but not “while the world is watching”. All the more reason to pay attention.
