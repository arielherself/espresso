<strong>Giorgia Meloni </strong>was appointed <strong>Italy’s</strong> first female prime minister after [facing down Silvio Berlusconi](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/20/italys-coalition-building-runs-into-trouble) in a tussle over her cabinet. Mr Berlusconi had wanted to choose the justice minister, but Ms Meloni named a member of her hard-right Brothers of Italy party to the post. Mr Berlusconi’s chumminess with Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, did not stop Ms Meloni from making Antonio Tajani, a member of Mr Berlusconi’s party, her foreign minister. Her right-wing government will be sworn in on Saturday.

The House committee investigating the January 6th attack [issued a subpoena](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/05/how-much-legal-jeopardy-is-donald-trump-in) to <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, and asked him to testify in person around November 14th. The move is largely symbolic: America’s former president will surely defy the subpoena and claim [executive privilege](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/11/10/what-is-executive-privilege). Earlier in the day <strong>Steve Bannon</strong>, Mr Trump’s former chief strategist, was sentenced to four months in prison and fined $6,500 for ignoring his own subpoenas.

<strong>Penny Mordaunt</strong>, the leader of the House of Commons, was the first to declare her candidacy in the Conservative Party’s [leadership election](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/10/20/who-will-be-britains-next-leader) to replace Liz Truss as prime minister. Other likely frontrunners include Rishi Sunak, a former chancellor, and Boris Johnson, an ex-prime minister who was forced to resign in July. Markets slumped further as official data revealed higher-than-predicted public-sector borrowing in September.

<strong>Imran Khan</strong>, [former prime minister](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/10/20/imran-khan-appears-to-be-more-popular-than-ever) of Pakistan, has been disqualified from political office for five years for alleged corruption. The country’s elections commission said Mr Khan misled officials about gifts he received from the leaders of Saudi Arabia and Dubai. Pakistan is expecting a general election in 2023, but Mr Khan—whose anti-government rallies have attracted mass support—cannot stand in them.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>America’s</strong> defence secretary spoke with his<strong> Russian</strong> equivalent for the first time since May. But the Kremlin reportedly took no interest in broader talks to end the war in Ukraine. Separately, Mitch McConnell, the top-ranking Senate Republican, said America should send more weapons to Ukraine. His remarks are at odds with his counterpart’s in the House: Kevin McCarthy recently [criticised what he called a “blank cheque”](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/17/is-america-growing-weary-of-the-long-war-in-ukraine) approach to Ukraine.

<strong>Gas prices fell</strong> in European markets after <strong>EU leaders </strong>agreed to continue working towards a possible price cap to “immediately limit” [spikes](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/13/europe-is-growing-complacent-about-its-energy-crisis). Dutch front-month gas, the European benchmark, fell 6% to €116 ($114) per megawatt hour on early Friday. France, Italy and Spain have long pushed for a [price ceiling](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/09/27/the-wrong-way-to-solve-europes-energy-crisis) in response to the energy crunch; Germany has opposed the market intervention arguing that it could hurt future supply.

<strong>Pfizer</strong> is set to nearly quadruple the price of its [covid-19 vaccine](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+economist+covid+vaccine&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBGB1026GB1026&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjZrrmYi_H6AhV3QEEAHSY7BPgQ_AUoAHoECAMQAg&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=609&amp;dpr=1.5) when the American government purchasing programme ends next year. The cost will rise to between $110 and $130 per dose, as the drugmaker tries to offset the financial effects of weak demand for booster vaccines. Angela Lukin, a Pfizer executive, said that the vaccine will remain free for Americans with either private or government-paid insurance.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 15%, the percentage of patients for whom antidepressants had a substantial benefit beyond a placebo. [Read the story](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/19/most-people-on-antidepressants-dont-need-them).

## Britain’s political déjà vu

Conservative politicians in Britain are, once again, squabbling about who should lead both their party and the country. On Thursday Liz Truss resigned as prime minister [after just 45 days in office](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/10/20/who-will-be-britains-next-leader). Candidates hoping to replace her must secure the support of 100 of their colleagues to qualify for an expedited leadership contest to be completed within the next week. No one has yet officially thrown their hat in the ring, but likely contenders include Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor; Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons; and Boris Johnson, the scandal-prone former prime minister. Of these, Mr Sunak currently seems the most popular with MPs.

Ms Truss departs amid widespread derision. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, stressed the need for Britain to find “stability”. Anthony Albanese noted that Ms Truss’s replacement will be his third British counterpart during his five months as Australia’s prime minister. Whomever it is will inherit a mountain of problems, not least constrained finances and a [nigh-on ungovernable party](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/02/18/the-conservative-party-has-become-factional-and-rebellious). 

## Steve Bannon faces the music

On Friday Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s former consigliere, was sentenced to four months in prison and fined $6,500 for contempt of Congress. The punishment follows his conviction in July of two misdemeanours for refusing to appear before a House committee [investigating the Capitol riot](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/10/congresss-capitol-riot-hearing-confirms-donald-trumps-complicity) on January 6th 2021. Prosecutors argued that his “name-calling, mimicry and menacing rhetoric” towards the committee members warranted incarceration.

The contempt-of-Congress statute is rarely enforced: no one has been imprisoned on such charges for more than half a century. Just one other person—Peter Navarro, a former adviser to Mr Trump—was indicted for thumbing his nose at the January 6th committee, though several higher-level aides also ignored subpoenas. Justice-department guidelines suggest that senior administration officials and the president should not be forced to testify before Congress, owing to [executive privilege](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/11/10/what-is-executive-privilege). So do not expect contempt charges for Mr Trump if, as is expected, he disregards his own forthcoming subpoena.

## Europe’s LNG bottlenecks

On Thursday France, Portugal and Spain announced a new pipeline between Barcelona and Marseille. Dubbed “BarMar”, the line is mostly intended to transport renewable gases including green hydrogen across the Mediterranean Sea, but it will also be allowed to carry a limited amount of natural gas.

The EU needs the extra capacity. As it races to [restock gas supplies](https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2022/09/24/war-in-ukraine-has-reshaped-worlds-fuel-markets) before winter, it has increasingly relied on [liquefied natural gas](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/02/26/if-the-supply-of-russian-gas-to-europe-were-cut-off-could-lng-plug-the-gap) ferried by super-chilled tankers, often from America, to replace the stuff piped from Russia. That has helped it fill its storage to more than 90%.

Yet recently bottlenecks have emerged. With the continent’s limited number of regasifying terminals now running at full capacity, dozens of tankers are being forced to wait their turn, with many circling off the coasts of Spain. Next year Spain will reopen El Musel, an LNG import terminal in the Bay of Biscay that has been idle for a decade. Neither that nor the BarMar pipeline will open fast enough to alleviate the current crisis. But they will help in the future.

## Italy inches closer to its new government

A delegation from the [right-wing alliance](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/28/italys-next-government-may-be-more-nationalist-than-europe-likes) that won Italy’s general election last month visited president Sergio Mattarella on Friday, rounding off the consultations that precede the formation of a [new government](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/15/italys-probable-next-government-contains-many-tensions). Usually, each party sends its own delegation. But the uneasy allies want to showcase their unity and readiness to govern in coalition under [Giorgia Meloni](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/22/how-afraid-should-europe-be-of-giorgia-meloni), who leads the hard-right [Brothers of Italy](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/22/giorgia-meloni-and-her-brothers-of-italy-look-set-to-win-the-next-election) party. 

The only fly in the ointment appears to be Silvio Berlusconi, who leads the Forza Italia party. Irate at being thwarted in the share-out of cabinet seats, the former prime minister has wrought havoc. In a recording leaked on Wednesday he embarrassed Ms Meloni by boasting of his closeness to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. After Mr Berlusconi’s tantrum Mr Mattarella doubtless wanted answers to some hard questions: about whether the right is as united as it claims, and whether Mr Berlusconi’s party should, as reportedly intended, get the foreign-affairs portfolio.

## The melancholy wit of “The Banshees Of Inisherin”

Martin McDonagh’s last comedy-drama, “[Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2017/11/08/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-finds-hope-in-tragedy)”, won the BAFTA for Best Film, among other awards, in 2018. The playwright-turned-filmmaker’s darkly funny follow-up, which is released in cinemas on Friday, “The Banshees Of Inisherin”, is too mysterious and melancholy to earn as many prizes. Yet it is sure to win a cult following.

Mr McDonagh has recast the stars of his debut movie, “In Bruges”, Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson. The pair play old drinking buddies who live on a tiny Irish island in 1923. Their friendship comes to an abrupt halt when one of them suddenly announces that he will chop off his own fingers if he ever has to talk to the other again. That succinct, absurdist plot is all that Mr McDonagh needs to make a poetic, sharply scripted and beautifully acted meditation on kindness, depression, art, the Irish civil war—and the self-destructive stubbornness of men everywhere.
