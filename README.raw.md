<strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, Volodymyr Zelensky, visited the [liberated](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/11/11/russia-claims-to-have-completed-its-withdrawal-from-kherson) city of <strong>Kherson</strong> and addressed a crowd gathered in the main square. Mr Zelensky reportedly said that Ukraine was “ready for peace”. Earlier he said that investigators have documented more than 400 war crimes committed by Russian troops around the city. Ukraine has also accused Russia of laying mines around critical infrastructure.

America&#x27;s president, <strong>Joe Biden</strong> and his Chinese counterpart, <strong>Xi Jinping</strong>, held their first face-to-face meeting since Mr Biden became president. A meeting in Bali ahead of the [G20 summit](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/11/13/the-dynamics-of-distrust-around-the-g20-summit) began with a friendly tone. Mr Biden spoke of his wish to avoid “conflict” with China and Mr Xi of the need to “elevate” the relationship between the two superpowers.

<strong>Turkey’s </strong>interior minister said that <strong>Kurdish militants</strong> based in [northern Syria](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/10/10/turkey-launches-an-attack-on-northern-syria) were to blame for a bombing in the heart of Istanbul on Sunday, which killed six people and injured about 80. He said police have arrested someone suspected of planting the bomb and detained another 21 people. Turkey’s president had been talking up the [threat of terrorism](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/06/09/as-elections-approach-turkeys-president-finds-enemies-everywhere) lately.

<strong>China’s </strong>regulators cheered investors with a plan to rescue the country’s embattled <strong>property markets</strong>. The People’s Bank of China and its partners outlined 16 steps they would take to strengthen the sector, starting with extensions on debt repayments. At one point shares in [Country Garden](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/15/chinas-property-crisis-hasnt-gone-away-it-is-getting-worse), a developer, leapt by more than 50%; many firms enjoyed gains of 30% and more.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>SoftBank’s</strong> wild ride got wilder, as the Japanese [tech-investment](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/05/16/after-a-bruising-year-softbank-braces-for-more-pain) group’s <strong>Vision Fund </strong>recorded a third straight quarter of swingeing losses and its share price plunged by more than 13%. SoftBank’s valuation had been enjoying a rally over the past fortnight, against the headwinds in Silicon Valley, but investors hoping to learn of a new [round of buybacks](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/06/17/hard-truths-about-softbank) were disappointed.

<strong>Britain’s</strong> chancellor of the exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, acknowledged that he must <strong>raise taxes</strong> when he delivers a [new fiscal plan](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/10/the-best-ways-to-fix-britains-budget) this week. He will also slash public spending, in trying to scrounge together £55bn ($62bn) to fill a fiscal hole. Mr Hunt was brought in to restore Britain’s economic credibility after the destructive micro-tenure of his predecessor, Kwasi Kwarteng.

There was still no certainty about which way <strong>America’s House of Representatives </strong>would fall, as glacial counts in several [too-close-to-call races](https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-midterms-2022/results/senate/?fsrc=core-app-economist) continued. The Republicans are six seats short of the 218 they would need for a majority. The Democrats are on 204. The final results may not be known for days. Over the weekend the Democrats [secured control](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/13/the-democrats-keep-control-of-the-senate) of the <strong>Senate</strong>, with wins in Arizona and Nevada.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 18, the voting age in Malaysia. The threshold was lowered from 21 last year, giving 1.2m more young people the right to vote on November 19th. [Read the full story.](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/11/10/malaysias-grand-old-party-eyes-a-comeback)

## Biden and Xi meet in Bali

President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, met in Bali on Monday. In their first face-to-face meeting since Mr Biden became president the pair tried to [stop](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/11/10/can-joe-biden-and-xi-jinping-stabilise-sino-american-relations) a [downward spiral](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/10/27/china-and-america-are-barely-speaking-though-crises-loom) in relations. The world expects America and China to “properly handle” their relationship, Mr Xi told Mr Biden.  
  
 Mr Biden’s approach to China has been unceasingly tough. He has curbed its access to advanced computing technology with a sweeping set of [export controls](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/10/13/america-curbs-chinese-access-to-advanced-computing), and repeatedly pledged to [defend Taiwan](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/05/23/what-is-americas-policy-of-strategic-ambiguity-over-taiwan), the self-governing island that China seeks to unify with the mainland.

White House officials talk of [“finding a floor”](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/11/13/the-dynamics-of-distrust-around-the-g20-summit) in the relationship. They are seeking ways to co-operate on issues such as climate change and food security. But Chinese officials demand that America give ground on Taiwan and technology exports before they discuss other issues. Mr Biden says no concessions will be made at the meeting. He wants to talk about “red lines” on both sides. Even that would count as progress.

## Crypto’s worst days may be yet to come

It has been a terrible year for crypto. By early November tightening financial conditions had halved the cryptosphere’s total market capitalisation. The latest blow may prove[ even worse](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2022/11/11/the-fallout-from-this-is-absolutely-enormous-a-crypto-implosion). 

On Friday, FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange run by Sam Bankman-Fried, and Alameda Research, his trading firm,[ filed for bankruptcy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/11/sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-exchange-files-for-bankruptcy). Evidence suggests FTX “lent” $10bn in customer funds to Alameda to prop it up. Regulators in both America and the Bahamas are investigating FTX. Whether customers get their money back has yet to be seen.

The crash will have lasting reverberations. FTX was deeply entangled with the rest of the cryptosphere, having invested in startups and bailed out faltering crypto firms like Voyager and BlockFi. Uncertainty about whether such firms will find new backers has contributed to another fall of almost 20% in crypto’s value in the past week. And while the crash has not yet spilled over into other financial markets, America’s government says crypto needs more oversight. While regulation may help restore faith in legitimate crypto businesses it could crush parts of the sector which thrive in its absence.

## The real work of COP27 begins

On Monday morning tired delegates shuffled back to a giant conference centre in Sharm el-Sheikh to begin the second week of COP27, the United Nations’ annual climate conference. World leaders making grand promises have left Egypt. It is now up to countries’ negotiating teams to hash out what they are prepared to do to tackle climate change.  
  
 Much has been made this year of poor countries’ desires for [“loss and damage”](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/03/what-is-climate-loss-and-damage) funding to compensate for the impacts of rising temperatures. That is being formally debated for the first time, but resistance from rich countries makes it highly unlikely that a relevant mechanism will be established.

The most substantive[ climate commitment](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/03/the-world-is-missing-its-lofty-climate-targets-time-for-some-realism) made during COP27 will probably not be made in Egypt at all. Later this week leaders in Bali for the [G20 summit](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/11/13/the-dynamics-of-distrust-around-the-g20-summit) are expected to announce a $15bn fund to help Indonesia decarbonise its coal-intensive economy, copying a $8.5bn deal struck with South Africa at COP26 last year.

## Challenges for India’s central bank

These are busy times for the Reserve Bank of India. As the rupee has depreciated against the dollar, reaching a record low in October, the central bank has intervened to stem the slide, burning through about $112bn of foreign-exchange reserves. It has also launched a pilot for a digital rupee, a [central-bank digital currency](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2022/04/20/how-central-banks-are-moving-into-e-money). 

The RBI’s biggest task, however, remains tackling inflation. Data for October, due on Monday, are likely to reveal an annual inflation rate of about 6.7%. That would be an improvement over the 7.4% recorded in September, but still above the target range of 2-6%. 

Rising prices have been driven by soaring [food costs](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/07/food-prices-are-outpacing-wider-inflation-across-most-of-the-world), which account for nearly half of India’s consumer-price index. But inflationary pressure may now be easing as global food inflation has slowed. The RBI’s governor is bullish: Shaktikanta Das believes that India’s fundamentals are strong, and the central bank’s regime of raising interest rates—up by 1.9 percentage points since April and expected to rise again in December—is working.

## “Yellowstone” returns Montana to the spotlight

John Dutton sees enemies everywhere—and they are coming for his land. This is the premise of “Yellowstone”, which returned to Paramount on Sunday. In four previous seasons Dutton, played by a leathery-looking Kevin Costner, has defended his Montana ranch from the government, hedge funds, militias, conservationists and his own children. “Horses and cattle may be how the West was won,” Mr Costner growls, “but death and taxes is how we’re gonna lose it.”

Some of the Duttons’ defence is done with assault rifles. But the family deploys ruthless realpolitik on par with “Succession” or “House of Cards”. This fifth season will see Dutton become governor of Montana. The show explores the state’s real politics too, such as the growing pains of its towns’ expanding into wilderness. “Yellowstone” is so popular that Taylor Sheridan, its creator, is planning two historical prequels, “1883” and “1923”, and a Texas spinoff.
