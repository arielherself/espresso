<strong>Ukraine’s </strong>president, Volodymyr Zelensky, was greeted by Britain’s prime minister, Rishi Sunak, as he arrived on a surprise visit to London. Mr Zelensky is due to give a speech to Parliament and meet King Charles III. Britain said it would train Ukrainian fighter jet pilots and marines; Ukraine desperately wants [Western jets](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/02/01/why-does-ukraine-want-western-jets-and-will-it-get-them) but is yet to receive them. Mr Zelensky is expected to meet EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday.

The death toll from the [large earthquakes](https://www.economist.com/international/2023/02/06/massive-earthquakes-in-turkey-and-northern-syria-kill-thousands) that struck parts of <strong>Turkey</strong> and <strong>Syria</strong> on Monday passed 11,000 and looks [certain to rise](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/02/07/the-scale-of-the-disaster-in-turkey-and-syria-keeps-growing) further. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, visited the Turkish provinces worst affected by the disaster. America, China and countries across Asia and Europe sent specialist help to support the rescue efforts.

In his <strong>state-of-the-union address</strong>, [Joe Biden](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/02/08/history-may-yet-judge-joe-bidens-presidency-as-transformational) appealed for Republican support for policies that he said would reduce America’s debt, aid “hard-working families” and deal with the threat from China. The prospect of bipartisanship appeared dim, however. Republicans accused the president of obsessing over “woke fantasies”. Despite rock-bottom approval ratings Mr Biden is expected soon to announce that he will run for president again in 2024.

<strong>Microsoft</strong> unveiled an AI-enhanced version of its Bing search engine. It is powered by the same technology behind ChatGPT, a chatbot created by OpenAI, a Microsoft-backed startup, and only accommodates a limited number of queries at present. Microsoft’s AI investment represents an [attempt to win market share](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/30/the-race-of-the-ai-labs-heats-up) in search from Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which has just announced its own AI-powered chatbot, Bard.

<strong>Jerome Powell</strong>, chair of America’s <strong>Federal Reserve</strong>, warned that interest rates may rise higher than [markets have anticipated](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/02/07/surging-stocks-undermine-a-hallowed-investing-rule) in order to restrain inflation. An unexpectedly strong jobs report last week, Mr Powell said during an event in Washington, “underscores the message” of caution. On February 1st the Fed raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point.

Thousands attended the funeral prayers of <strong>Pervez Musharraf</strong>, Pakistan’s former [president](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/02/05/pervez-musharraf-was-one-of-pakistans-better-dictators), in Karachi, a city in the south of the country. Mr Musharraf, who died on Sunday, led a coup in 1999 and went on to rule Pakistan for nearly a decade, first as “chief executive” then as president. He had lived in Dubai since 2016.

<strong>LeBron James</strong>, an American basketball player, broke a 39-year-old record to become the all-time leading scorer in the NBA. [Mr James](https://www.economist.com/game-theory/2017/06/08/lebron-james-has-provided-a-lift-to-small-businesses), who plays for the Los Angeles Lakers, scored 38 points during his team’s loss against Oklahoma City Thunder. That took his career tally to 38,390, just above the 38,387 record set by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The previous top scorer, now 75, was in the stadium to see his record fall. 

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>15, the average number of earthquakes stronger than magnitude 7 per year. [See the full story](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/02/06/what-made-the-earthquake-in-turkey-and-syria-so-deadly).

## Iger’s first quarter back at Disney

Three months ago, after Disney’s streaming business, Disney+, lost $1bn in a quarter, the entertainment giant fired its chief executive.[ Bob Iger](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/21/disney-brings-back-a-star-of-the-past-but-its-real-problem-is-the-script) was brought back from retirement and given two years to turn it around. On Wednesday Disney will report its latest quarterly earnings, the first with him back in charge. 

Last year the firm’s market value nearly halved. Seeking to recoup some losses at Disney+, Mr Iger raised subscription prices in December. A new “Avatar” film, which has made more than $2bn at the box office, and busy theme parks have helped edge the share price up by around 25% this year.

Disney is carrying $37bn of net debt, however. Mr Iger is reportedly considering licensing more content to competitors. But he is under fire from Nelson Peltz, an activist investor who is demanding a seat on the board and has complained about the firm’s creaking balance-sheet. Investors will be looking for news of Mr Iger’s plans for ABC, Disney’s broadcast network, and ESPN, its sports channel.

## The Northern Ireland protocol in court

Britain’s Supreme Court unanimously ruled on Wednesday that the [Northern Ireland protocol](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/06/14/britains-bill-to-rip-up-the-northern-ireland-protocol-is-a-terrible-idea), the post-Brexit fudge which created a trade border between Britain and Northern Ireland, is not unlawful because of the Act of Union, which created the United Kingdom (which includes both) in 1801. The case, brought by unionists who oppose the border, was always unlikely to pass. Lower courts in Belfast had previously ruled that the protocol conflicts with the Act of Union but that it is nevertheless legal because British MPs voted for it. And any ruling against the protocol could have been overturned in Westminster anyway.

The political consequences of the case may linger, though. The decision comes as Britain and the EU are reportedly closing in on a deal to reduce checks on goods moving across the Irish Sea border. The verdict will have no legal impact on the talks, but drawing attention to the protocol as a constitutional issue makes the technical compromise harder to swallow for Northern Ireland’s unionists.

## Sri Lanka’s plan to save its economy

Amid an ongoing[ currency crisis](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/19/why-is-sri-lanka-in-turmoil) and months after protests[ ousted a president](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/13/sri-lankas-president-flees-leaving-the-country-in-chaos), Sri Lanka’s woes persist. Medicine and fuel are scarce and power cuts occur daily. On Wednesday thousands of unionised workers, including doctors and bankers, are striking and protesting against a recent increase in income taxes.

On the same day Ranil Wickremesinghe, the president, who was chosen by Parliament after Gotabaya Rajapaksa quit, outlined his plans to “rise out of bankruptcy” by 2026. He vowed to reduce inflation from the current 54% to single digits by the end of this year. His long-term plans also include shrinking the government, reforming the electoral system and introducing anti-corruption legislation.

Reforms are required to secure a $2.9bn loan from the IMF, which has stalled because China, a big creditor, is yet to offer a debt restructuring plan that will be acceptable to the IMF. In his speech, the president said China had given him “positive responses”. But growing resistance to Mr Wickremesinghe’s painful policies may yet prove his greatest hurdle.

## North Korea puts on a military show

After months of rehearsals, the big day is here. Satellite imagery suggests that North Korean soldiers and civilians have been training for a military parade celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People’s Army on Wednesday. Expect marching troops, citizens in formation spelling out slogans and jets racing across the skies over Pyongyang, the capital.

North Korea loves to mark anniversaries. But the parade also signals the country’s readiness for war. On Monday Kim Jong Un, the country’s dictator, discussed “intensifying” its [military drills](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/10/18/north-korea-is-preparing-for-another-nuclear-test-or-many) with his generals. That came exactly 60 years after his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, said that each North Korean soldier must be ready to kill 100 enemies. 

Those perceived enemies are still to the south. South Korea’s conservative president, [Yoon Suk-yeol](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/01/19/why-south-korea-is-talking-about-getting-its-own-nukes), has similarly been talking about creating a deterrent that would strike “100 or 1,000 times” harder than any North Korean blow. Koreans on both sides of the border will be hoping that their leaders are just posturing.

## Trailblazing ​​Kuwaiti women on screen

“The Exchange”, an Arabic-language drama about two of the first women working at Kuwait’s stock exchange in the 1980s, is released on Netflix on Wednesday. Dressed in vibrant suits with coiffed hair, Munira and Farida take on the boys’ club together. Though they are often disregarded, they manage to rise through the ranks. Filmed entirely in Kuwait, “The Exchange” was inspired by pioneering businesswomen that Nadia Ahmad, one of the show’s writers, knew when she was growing up.

Netflix released its first original [Arabic-language](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/10/23/streaming-services-are-helping-arab-producers-liven-up-television) series, “Jinn”, in 2019. Since then it has employed more Arab women on both sides of the camera. “Finding Ola”, about an [Egyptian divorcee](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/15/arabs-are-divorcing-more-often), was produced by and starred Hend Sabry, a Tunisian-Egyptian film star. Arab women have often appeared one-dimensional in Western art, portrayed as either oppressed or orientalised. Helping them tell their own stories will change that.
