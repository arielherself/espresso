Yair Lapid,<strong> Israel’s</strong> prime minister, conceded defeat in parliamentary elections to <strong>Binyamin Netanyahu</strong>, clearing the way for Mr Netanyahu to [reclaim his old job](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/02/netanyahu-seems-on-track-to-be-israels-next-prime-minister). Mr Netanyahu’s religious and right-wing coalition appears to have won 64 of 120 seats in parliament. Mr Lapid’s bloc took 51; an unaffiliated Arab party claimed the rest. To form a government Mr Netanyahu will need the support of Itamar Ben-Gvir’s far-right religious party, which until recently was a political pariah.

Investors fretted over hawkish comments by Jerome Powell, chairman of the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong>, who suggested that it would be “premature” to pause monetary tightening. Interest rates will ultimately be “higher than previously expected”, he said, shortly after America’s central bank [raised its benchmark interest rate](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/11/02/inflation-is-too-high-when-the-public-notices-it) by three-quarters of a percentage point, its fourth consecutive jumbo increase. The S&amp;P 500 shed 2.5% and Asian stockmarkets fell during early trading on Thursday.

G7 foreign ministers gathered in Germany to discuss aid plans to help <strong>Ukraine </strong>[get through winter](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/11/01/keeping-ukraine-from-freezing-this-winter) amid Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure. Strikes cut off the [Zaporizhia nuclear plant](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/19/what-is-at-stake-at-ukraines-zaporizhia-nuclear-plant) from the national grid on Thursday. Meanwhile, reports emerged that Russia was undergoing a retreat from [Kherson](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/30/why-does-kherson-matter) to the east bank of the Dnieper river. Ukrainian officials say the rumoured withdrawal could be a trap.

The <strong>Bank of England</strong> raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage points to 3%, the largest increase for over 30 years, as it [battles](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/07/28/the-bank-of-england-must-weather-high-inflation-and-meddling-politicians) to tackle soaring inflation. It was the eighth consecutive rise. The bank warned that the country faces a lengthy recession, but suggested rates would not have to rise as high as the 5.25% figure expected by investors.

<strong>Imran Khan</strong>, Pakistan’s former prime minister, was reportedly shot in the lower leg while leading a rally in Wazirabad in the east of the country, in what his supporters describe as an assassination attempt. Mr Khan is [calling for snap elections](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/10/20/imran-khan-appears-to-be-more-popular-than-ever) following his [ousting](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/04/16/shehbaz-sharif-is-pakistans-new-prime-minister) from power in April. Local media reports that he fled the scene and is now out of danger.

<strong>Uniper</strong>, a German gas importer the government intends to nationalise, announced a net [loss](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/09/08/some-european-power-companies-are-on-the-brink) of over €40bn ($39.3bn) in the first nine months of 2022, one of the largest losses in German corporate history. Disruption of [Russian gas deliveries](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/14/can-deutschland-ag-cope-with-the-russian-gas-shock) caused by the invasion of Ukraine forced the company to seek more expensive supplies elsewhere. Germany’s government announced a €29bn ($28.3bn) bailout of Uniper in September.

<strong>Iran’s</strong> security forces fired on crowds in the city of Karaj, gathered to mark the end of the 40-day mourning period for Hadis Najafi, a 22-year-old protester killed in September, witnesses told the BBC. Police created roadblocks to prohibit people visiting her grave, reacting violently when thousands tried to reach the cemetery regardless. Najafi has become a symbol of the [female-led protests](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/27/could-irans-regime-fall) sweeping across Iran.

## Donald Trump in Iowa

Historically, Iowa was one of America’s swing states, but these days it is reliably red. Nevertheless Donald Trump, a former president, will be in Sioux City on Thursday hosting a rally with Chuck Grassley, the state’s 89-year-old Republican senator, and Kim Reynolds, the Republican governor, ahead of the midterms on November 8th.

Although Mr Grassley is facing a tighter race than at any point in his 42 years in the Senate, few truly believe his Democratic opponent, Mike Franken, has much of a chance. Ms Reynolds is also solidly ahead. So Mr Trump, who rarely does anything that he does not think will benefit him, may have another reason for visiting the Hawkeye state.

Asked in October about running for president, Mr Trump said he will “probably have to do it again.” Iowa votes for its preferred presidential candidates before any other state. In 2016, Mr Trump came second in a [crowded field](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2016/02/04/trump-bumped), propelling him up the [GOP ticket](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2016/05/26/donald-trump-gets-the-1237-delegates-he-needs-for-the-republican-nomination). Could he be laying the groundwork for 2024?

## Scholz’s China strategy

On Thursday Germany’s chancellor will travel to Beijing. China is Germany’s largest trading partner and Olaf Scholz is the first Western leader to visit since the start of the covid-19 pandemic. The symbolism is huge, but not as straightforward as it seems. 

After he was elected in 2021 Mr Scholz promised to [recalibrate](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/06/16/germany-is-recalibrating-its-close-economic-ties-with-china) Germany’s close economic ties with China. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the resulting energy crisis, highlighted the [dangers](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/20/russia-was-more-deeply-embedded-in-german-politics-than-suspected) of [economic dependence](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/11/thanks-to-vladimir-putin-germany-has-woken-up) on an autocracy. Yet China matters much more than Russia to German business.  
  
 Mr Scholz is travelling with [German business leaders](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/11/02/olaf-scholz-leads-a-blue-chip-business-delegation-to-china) and he recently approved a controversial Chinese investment in a port in Hamburg. This suggests a continuation of the [softer stance](https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/07/16/angela-merkels-soft-china-stance-is-challenged-at-home) of Angela Merkel, his predecessor. But in an article published on Thursday, in <em>Politico</em> and the <em>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</em>, Mr Scholz defended his position and insisted that, although Germany is far from decoupling from China, it will continue to assess the risks of doing business there.

## The Bank of England raises interest rates

Britain’s monetary policymakers met investors’ expectations when on Thursday they voted to lift the official interest rate by 0.75 percentage points, to 3%. That is the sharpest increase in over three decades, and will tug mortgage rates higher and general demand lower. To justify the move, policymakers pointed to the risk that uncomfortably high annual inflation in September of 10.1% becomes entrenched.

Knowing where to go next is not easy. One prime minister, Liz Truss,[ spooked markets](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/11/liz-truss-has-made-britain-a-riskier-bet-for-bond-investors) with promises of tax cuts. Now a new one,[ Rishi Sunak](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/10/27/rishi-sunak-britains-new-prime-minister-starts-on-the-defensive), is planning [the opposite](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/10/20/as-britains-government-looks-to-save-money-almost-nothing-is-protected). Details of those plans are due on November 17th, casting a fog over the fiscal outlook. It may take longer to find out what help households will get with energy bills beyond April. 

It is unclear yet whether inflation associated with higher energy prices will prove persistent or whether higher costs will sap demand and lower prices. Amid that uncertainty, taming inflation without kicking the economy too hard will prove exceptionally tricky.

## Lula’s choice for Petrobras

Brazil’s state-run oil giant, Petrobras, will publish its earnings for the third quarter on Thursday. Expect robust cashflow and payouts to investors. Nevertheless, the current quarter will be the last for Caio Mário Paes de Andrade, chief executive since June.

Brazil’s largest company has been a political instrument since its foundation in the 1950s. Jair Bolsonaro, who lost the presidential election on October 30th, [fired](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/02/27/why-the-sacking-of-petrobrass-boss-spooked-markets) three Petrobras bosses during his four-year tenure. [Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/10/31/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva-will-be-brazils-next-president), who will take office in January, will name his new team soon, including a boss for Petrobras.

Lula’s relationship with Petrobras will be closely watched for repeats of mistakes made in his previous terms, between 2003 and 2010. In 2014 Petrobras was found to be at the heart of a [corruption scheme](https://www.economist.com/americas-view/2014/09/08/the-petrobras-affair) uncovered during the [Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigation](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/04/30/two-law-enforcement-officials-reflect-on-a-brazilian-corruption-scandal). Eight Petrobras directors were convicted. Lula’s involvement earned him a 12-year sentence of which he spent a year and a half [in jail](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2018/04/08/lula-goes-to-jail) (although his convictions were later annulled). He must make his appointment carefully.

## David Hockney continues to bloom

On his first day at the Royal College of Art, in London, in 1959, [David Hockney](https://www.economist.com/1843/2019/02/28/smoking-with-david-hockney) drew a skeleton. His draughtsmanship so impressed another student—the American painter R.B. Kitaj—that he offered Mr Hockney £5 (then $14) for it. 

Some sixty years on, Mr Hockney’s [talent is undimmed](https://www.economist.com/1843/2017/02/14/david-hockneys-road-to-renewal), though he now uses an iPad instead of pencil and paper. The artist who made California’s [swimming pools](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2017/02/14/the-tate-dives-into-the-art-of-david-hockney) famous (one of his pool pictures sold for $90m in 2018, briefly making it the most expensive artwork ever sold at auction by a living artist) now lives in France, where he mostly paints nature. 

Four concurrent exhibitions of his work, entitled “20 Flowers and Some Bigger Pictures”, open this month in Chicago, London, Los Angeles and Paris—with a fifth joining later in New York. Each show contains nearly 30 iPad works, both individual digital paintings and composite pictures with multiple screens, that explore hillsides, flowers and shadows. The artist calls them “new looking fresh pictures of a very beautiful world”.
