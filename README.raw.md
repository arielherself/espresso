As expected America’s <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> [raised its benchmark interest rate](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/11/02/inflation-is-too-high-when-the-public-notices-it) by three-quarters of a percentage point, the fourth consecutive jumbo increase. That brings the federal-funds rate to a range of 3.75-4.0%, its highest since 2008, and comes amid the central bank’s [battle against inflation](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/19/why-inflation-refuses-to-go-away), which hit 8.2% in September. Investors will scrutinise remarks from Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, on Wednesday for signs of whether the pace of tightening will ease next month.

<strong>Russia </strong>said that it would rejoin a [deal](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/28/will-the-grain-deal-between-russia-and-ukraine-reduce-global-hunger) allowing exports of grain to leave Ukrainian ports on the Black Sea. Tass, the Russian state media agency, reported that the government had received “written guarantees” that Ukraine would not use the trade corridors to launch military attacks. The Kremlin had [suspended the agreement](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/30/putin-suspends-a-deal-to-allow-grain-exports-from-ukraine) on Saturday. 

America’s two largest <strong>pharmacies </strong>tentatively agreed to pay more than $10bn to settle claims brought by state, local and tribal governments accusing the retailers of inappropriately filling <strong>opioid</strong> prescriptions. CVS and Walgreens did not admit wrongdoing. Prescription opioids alone caused more than 250,000 [overdose deaths](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/07/21/americas-opioid-crisis-developed-in-plain-sight) in America between 1999 and 2020. 

<strong>Ethiopia’s</strong> government and leaders from <strong>Tigray</strong>, its rebellious northern region, agreed to an immediate <strong>ceasefire</strong> in [peace talks](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/27/ethiopias-peace-talks-may-be-overtaken-by-battlefield-advances) brokered by the African Union. Representatives from Tigray said they had made unspecified “concessions”. A [previous truce](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/04/02/a-fragile-ceasefire-offers-hope-in-ethiopia) struck in March lasted five months. Hundreds of thousands are thought to have died in the civil war, which began in November 2020.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Binyamin Netanyahu</strong> said his party was on the “brink of a very big victory” in<strong> Israel’s</strong> [general election](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/27/israels-binyamin-netanyahu-bids-for-an-election-comeback). With roughly 85% of the votes counted, the former prime minister’s right-wing bloc looks set to form a majority government, toppling the coalition led by Yair Lapid. Mr Netanyahu was forced from office in 2021 amid accusations of corruption. 

<strong>Maersk </strong>warned that container demand was weakening as concerns about recession unsettle global trade. The Danish shipping group recorded unadjusted, underlying earnings of $10.9bn in the third quarter, up from $6.9bn in the same period last year. But the war in Ukraine, and Europe’s energy crisis, have darkened the firm’s outlook, just as a pandemic-related boom in [freight rates](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/09/30/global-shipping-costs-are-plunging-as-the-world-economy-slows) subsides.

<strong>America </strong>will offer $13bn in federal funding to help low-income households cope with soaring energy costs this winter. Average household heating bills could be up to 28% more expensive than last winter, according to official estimates. The [intervention](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/27/the-risks-of-bidenomics-go-beyond-inflation) accompanies several similar measures such as the [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/09/joe-bidens-signature-legislation-passes-the-senate-at-last), which will distribute $9bn between 1.6m households to help tackle bills.

## All eyes on Jerome Powell

America’s Federal Reserve raised interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point on Wednesday, its fourth straight increase of that magnitude. The Fed has lifted short-term rates from a floor of 0% in March to 3.75%, its sharpest tightening since the early 1980s, as it tries to rein in [inflation](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/02/americas-economy-is-too-strong-for-its-own-good), which is above an annual rate of 8%.

Given that markets have priced in the rate increase, the focus will be on what [Jerome Powell](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2022/09/22/chairman-powell-made-clear-there-would-be-more-pain-to-come), the Fed’s chairman, says in a subsequent news conference. Look for hints about whether he is ready to slow the pace of tightening, perhaps teeing the Fed up for a half-point rate increase at its next meeting in December. But he will also no doubt explain that future decisions depend on data, leaving the Fed wriggle room to deliver yet another jumbo rate rise if inflation remains uncomfortably high.

## Infrastructure disasters in India

Opened in 1879, Jhulto Pul “hanging bridge” was the biggest tourist attraction in Morbi, a Gujarati town. Now it is the site of India’s [latest man-made disaster](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/02/17/indias-omicron-wave-recedes-but-not-the-risk-of-premature-death). On October 30th, four days after the pedestrian suspension bridge reopened following maintenance work, its cables snapped, plunging several hundred people into the Machchhu river. On Wednesday Gujarat will mark a day of mourning for the victims. 

Oreva, the company which operates the bridge, has blamed people for swaying the walkway. But its employees are among the nine people arrested so far over the collapse. Ahead of state elections in December, opposition parties have alleged corruption over the way Oreva, chiefly a clock-maker, was awarded the bridge contract by the municipality of Morbi and the government of Gujarat, which are controlled by the Bharatiya Janata Party. Narendra Modi, India’s BJP prime minister, has ordered a “detailed and extensive” inquiry. The Supreme Court will open an investigation on November 14th. Indians will not expect much. Post-mortems following similar tragedies have done little to improve governance or shoddy engineering.

## A spyware scandal in Greece

Officials from the European Parliament are in [Greece](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/05/19/rows-over-press-freedom-overshadow-greeces-recent-achievements) on Wednesday to probe whether the ruling party used spyware to illegally snoop on politicians and a journalist. The government of Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the prime minister, has denied that it bought the Israeli-made Predator software (which is similar to the Pegasus [spyware](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/07/31/israel-is-loth-to-regulate-its-spyware-exports) used by governments including Mexico and Saudi Arabia). But the reluctance of officials to meet with investigators has fuelled worries that his New Democracy party was involved in an attempt last year to hack the phone of Nikos Androulakis, the leader of Pasok-Kinal, an opposition party.

A Greek parliamentary inquiry ended abruptly last month after government MPs blocked requests by opposition ones to call important witnesses. They included managers at Intellexa, an Israeli-controlled company based in Athens which sold Predator, and Mr Misotakis’s nephew, the then-chief of the cabinet office. The European committee may struggle to untangle such a web. But if it finds evidence that the government was behind the eavesdropping, it could blow up Mr Mitsotakis’s chances of winning a general election next spring. 

## Africa’s energy problem

This week delegates, lobbyists and bag-carriers begin trickling into Sharm El-Sheikh, in Egypt, for COP27, the United Nations’ annual climate summit. The event, which officially kicks off on Sunday, is being advertised as “Africa’s COP” with a focus on the continent.

As delegates haggle over how to reduce global emissions, they should remember how little energy Africa uses. An average person in sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa) uses about 180kWh a year, less than the average American fridge. 

If Africa is to grow richer, [its energy use must increase](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2022/05/14/yemi-osinbajo-on-the-hypocrisy-of-rich-countries-climate-policies). Renewable energy is essential, but Africa cannot rely on it alone. More gas, which is polluting but cleaner than coal, is needed in the mix. But, despite happily importing fossil fuels, governments in the West mostly now refuse to finance new fossil-fuel projects in Africa or poor countries elsewhere. Those negotiating at COP27 should acknowledge that green growth in the region is a worthwhile goal—but it should not come at the cost of turning on the lights.

## British prime ministers on screen

In a recent self-promotional video [Rishi Sunak](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/10/27/rishi-sunak-britains-new-prime-minister-starts-on-the-defensive), Britain’s prime minister, appears to be modelling himself on the clean-cut, shirt-sleeved occupant of 10 Downing Street played by Hugh Grant in “Love Actually”, a romantic comedy. The slickly produced clip has been mocked online, but there are not many other fictional role models for Mr Sunak to choose from.  
  
 Whereas cinema’s American presidents are often noble and brave, British prime ministers on screen are usually self-serving schemers. Francis Urquhart (Ian Richardson) in “House Of Cards” is a Machiavellian murderer; Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) in “The Ghost Writer” is a CIA stooge; Vivienne Rook (Emma Thompson) in “Years And Years” is a fascist; and in “Doctor Who” Harold Saxon (John Simm) is the Doctor’s arch-enemy, the Master. A more benign example is Jim Hacker (Paul Eddington) in “Yes, Prime Minister”; he was merely an amiable bungler. British screenwriters rarely make their prime ministers heroes. Given the [scandals](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/07/boris-johnson-should-go-immediately) and [upheavals](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/28/how-not-to-run-a-country) of recent months, that is not likely to change.
