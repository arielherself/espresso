Russia’s <strong>Gazprom </strong>announced it would further cut [gas flows](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter) through the <strong>Nord Stream 1 </strong>pipeline to Europe via Germany. Daily deliveries will drop to 20% of capacity, from the current 40%. [Gazprom](https://www.economist.com/business/how-gazprom-helps-the-kremlin-put-the-squeeze-on-europe/21807841) said the pipeline, which was shut recently for repairs, needs further work, whereas Germany’s economic ministry insisted there was “no technical reason” for the reduction. Oil prices rose, on the expectation that Europeans (siding with Ukraine) may shift from gas to crude to cover their energy needs.

<strong>Walmart</strong> pared down its profit forecast for this year, sending shares in American retail firms for a spin. The [beast of Bentonville](https://www.economist.com/business/2017/12/07/the-beast-of-bentonville-battles-amazon-the-king-of-the-e-commerce-jungle) predicted its annual profits will decline by 11-13%, as food and fuel prices force consumers to reduce discretionary spending. Walmart’s shares promptly fell by 10% and Amazon’s fell by 4%. The S&amp;P 500’s Retail Index is down by 24% this year.

<strong>Alibaba </strong>will apply to list in <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, allowing investors from mainland China to buy shares in the Chinese e-commerce giant directly. The firm is already listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but Chinese officials want companies to trade domestically. In January [Hong Kong’s](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/29/the-battle-between-asias-financial-centres-is-heating-up) stock exchange started permitting “innovative” Chinese companies to carry out dual listings. Daniel Zhang, Alibaba’s boss (successor to Jack Ma, a victim of [China’s crackdown ](https://www.economist.com/business/can-chinese-big-tech-learn-to-love-big-brother/21809084)on big tech), said this would help attract a “more diversified investor base”.

<strong>Pope Francis</strong> delivered a long-awaited apology in <strong>Canada</strong> for decades of abuse at Catholic-run [residential schools](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/07/26/what-happened-at-residential-schools-for-indigenous-children-in-north-america). The schools separated some 150,000 indigenous children from their families and intended to forcibly assimilate them into Christian society. Thousands of children died; physical and [sexual abuse](https://www.economist.com/international/2022/07/14/catholic-reformers-want-big-changes-to-a-church-marred-by-sex-abuse) were common. The pope has called his visit to Canada a “pilgrimage of penance”.

The <strong>Oak Fire</strong> near Yosemite National Park was only “10% contained” on Monday, according to <strong>California’s</strong> fire department, despite thousands of firefighters being deployed to tackle it. Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in the area; its smoke was anticipated in the San Francisco Bay Area by Monday night. The [wildfire](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2022/07/08/what-to-read-to-understand-the-burning-of-the-american-west) ignited on Friday and has so far set over 16,700 acres (6,758 hectares) of land ablaze.

Ground workers for <strong>Lufthansa</strong>, Germany’s national airline, decided to strike for one day—this Wednesday—in pursuit of a 9.5% pay rise. The industry’s union said the walkout of 20,000 employees would lead to delays and cancelled flights, which have plagued the industry this summer. Heathrow recently cut the number of flights through September to cope with [labour shortages](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/06/09/air-travel-is-taking-flight-again).

<strong>David Trimble</strong>, an Ulster unionist leader and architect of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, has died aged 77. Trimble and [John Hume](https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/08/05/john-humes-vision-of-peace-in-northern-ireland-is-only-half-fulfilled), his nationalist counterpart in the Social Democratic and Labour Party, were awarded the Nobel peace prize for their efforts to end the conflict in [Northern Ireland](https://www.economist.com/britain/2021/04/15/northern-irelands-unhappy-centenary). After the agreement was signed, Trimble was elected to be Northern Ireland’s inaugural first minister.

## A criminal probe into Trumpworld

The House committee investigating Donald Trump’s interference in the 2020 election has laid a road map for federal prosecutors, who [could charge him with a crime](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/16/the-criminal-case-against-donald-trump) related to his conduct. But it is in Atlanta, Georgia, where the former president and his henchmen face the most immediate legal peril. Fani Willis, a local prosecutor, has been probing his efforts to overturn his loss in the state. She has subpoenaed dozens of witnesses, including Lindsey Graham, a US senator, and Rudy Giuliani, Mr Trump’s former lawyer. On Monday a grand jury will hear recorded testimony from Brian Kemp, the state’s governor.

Mr Trump notoriously ordered Georgia’s top election official to “find” enough votes to reverse his defeat. Soliciting election fraud is a crime in the state; legal experts reckon that demand puts him at risk of getting indicted. Ms Willis has already told the 16 “electors” who falsely cast the state’s electoral votes for Mr Trump that they are criminal targets. Asked whether she will subpoena Mr Trump, she stays evasive: “We’ll just have to see.”

## Tunisia’s president tears up the constitution

Democracy can end with a whimper—not a bang. On Monday Tunisians are voting on a [new constitution](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/07/21/tunisias-president-is-pushing-an-ominous-constitution). The charter would weaken parliament in favour of the president, giving him the right to hire and fire ministers and to impose an unlimited state of emergency. There would be no process for removing him. If approved, the constitution would consolidate a power grab by Kais Saied, the [authoritarian-minded president](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/tunisia-is-setting-itself-up-for-an-autocratic-future), who has ruled by decree since he suspended parliament last July.

Unlike the country’s 2014 constitution, drawn up in collaboration with the public in the wake of the Arab spring, which began in Tunisia, the new one—which Mr Saied claims will “correct” the course of the revolution—was written largely in secret. Voters have had less than a month to consider its contents. Mr Saied appointed Sadok Belaid, an accomplished law professor, to draft it, but Mr Belaid says the final text is quite different from what he submitted. He calls it “dangerous”. Opposition groups have urged Tunisians to boycott the referendum; turnout will probably be low (it was just 4.5% in the diaspora after two days of overseas voting). Eleven years after they [toppled a dictator](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2014/10/25/spring-is-still-in-the-air), many Tunisians have grown frustrated with impotent democratic leaders. But Mr Saied has little to offer except a return to the past.

## Ryanair’s soaring fortunes

European air travel has been [anything but smooth](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/07/travel-chaos-in-europe-is-a-glimpse-of-a-future-with-few-spare-workers) this summer. Staff shortages have led to long queues, giant piles of suitcases and angry passengers. But not everyone has been affected: Ryanair’s customers have been spared the worst of the chaos.

As Michael O’Leary, the airline’s boss, bragged on an earnings call on Monday, that is thanks to careful planning. Unlike other airlines, Ryanair did not lay off large numbers of staff when the pandemic began, thereby avoiding a last-minute race to rehire workers as travel demand rebounded. It also dodged soaring fuel prices by hedging its costs in advance. The airline reported a profit of $174m in the quarter ending in June, higher than analysts had predicted. 

But there may be turbulence ahead. Mr O’Leary warned that the recovery remains “fragile” and high oil prices will increase costs. And Ryanair is not completely immune from staffing woes: on Monday workers in Spain will walk out, demanding better working conditions.

## The rise and rise of franchise cricket

When the International Cricket Council, the sport’s governing body, sets out the next year’s playing calendar at its annual general meeting on Monday, the real insight lies not in when matches are being played—but when they aren’t.

As lucrative franchise leagues take off around the world, the ICC is increasingly prioritising domestic competitions over international test matches. In this year’s schedule, the [Indian Premier League](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/03/26/how-the-ipl-reflects-indias-strengths-and-weaknesses)—the most valuable competition in cricket—is expected to get an official two-and-a-half-month window where almost no international cricket will be played. That will allow the league to attract more players.

Other, less profitable, leagues will not get quite the same concessions. But the ICC is poised to give England and Australia breaks from international games during their own tournaments, so local players can compete. But while the proliferation of cricket may entertain fans, it risks burning out players. Last week Ben Stokes, England’s 31-year-old test captain, retired from one-day-international cricket; his body, he said, was “letting him down”.

## Politics in the Philippines: a generation game

In Manila on Monday the newly-elected president of the Philippines, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, gave his first annual address to Congress. Mr Marcos confidently spelt out a populist but generally plausible programme of government, full of detail on policy. Such detail had been glaringly absent from his [election campaign](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/06/29/by-electing-another-marcos-filipinos-show-they-have-forgotten-history), when vague slogans were enough to persuade voters that he would forgo the killing and thieving characteristic of the dictatorial regime of his late father, the first President Ferdinand Marcos, who was deposed by a popular uprising in 1986.

The younger Marcos has a strong incentive to put into action a sensible, democratic programme as it would justify the political rehabilitation of his dynasty. That would in turn improve the career prospects of the new president’s own eldest son, Ferdinand Alexander “Sandro” Marcos, a newly elected congressman—who was among the audience listening to his father’s address.
