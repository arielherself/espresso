## <p align="center">Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter</p>

India’s prime minister, <strong>Narendra Modi</strong>, publicly criticised Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, telling President <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> that “today’s era is not an era of war”. Mr Putin responded that he understood Mr Modi’s concerns. Meanwhile China’s president, <strong>Xi Jinping</strong>, said that Russia and its Central Asian neighbours should take care to avoid foreign interference or “colour revolutions”.

<strong>Ukrainian</strong> officials said they had discovered a <strong>mass grave</strong> in Izyum, a north-eastern town [recently recaptured](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/15/a-stunning-counter-offensive-by-ukraines-armed-forces) from Russian forces. They claimed that more than 400 bodies had been buried there, including people killed by air strikes. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, accused Russia of leaving “death everywhere”.

The<strong> S&amp;P 500</strong> suffered its worst week since June, shedding 4.8%, dragged down by FedEx, whose shares dropped by a fifth. A day earlier the delivery firm announced cost cuts and poor preliminary results, citing weak global demand. With inflation [stubbornly high](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/13/america-still-has-an-inflation-problem), investors are bracing for the Federal Reserve to [raise interest rates](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/14/to-fix-americas-inflation-problem-the-federal-reserve-must-go-big) by three-quarters of a percentage point next week.

The governor of <strong>West Virginia</strong> signed into law a near-total abortion ban. The measure, with exceptions in some cases of rape and incest, prohibits the procedure after an embryo is implanted in the uterus, usually within days of conception. West Virginia is the second state, after Indiana, to pass restrictive abortion legislation since the Supreme Court [overturned <em>Roe v Wade</em>](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/25/americas-abortion-providers-face-a-fight-for-survival); in several other states pre-<em>Roe</em> bans have come into force.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

The <strong>European Commission</strong> proposed setting up a <strong>media watchdog</strong> to ensure funding transparency and independence, and prevent consolidation, among news outlets in member states. The measure is obliquely aimed at Hungary and [Poland](https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/08/14/polands-proposed-media-rules-threaten-press-freedom), where governments have exerted control over public broadcasters and undermined independent news organisations. EU lawmakers and member states must approve the rules.

Nayib Bukele, <strong>El Salvador’s </strong>illiberal president, said he would run for re-election when his term ends in 2024. Despite a constitutional ban against presidents serving consecutive terms, judges appointed by Mr Bukele’s party gave him the green light last year. The 41-year-old styles himself as a thoroughly modern leader but [deploys authoritarian tactics](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/04/30/el-salvadors-president-has-locked-up-19000-people-in-a-month) and has repeatedly [undermined the rule of law](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/09/11/nayib-bukele-is-wrecking-democracy-in-el-salvador).

The [queue for entry to Westminster Hall](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/15/why-britons-love-to-queue) in <strong>London</strong>, where <strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong> is lying in state, closed for seven hours after it reached full capacity. Despite government warnings of 24-hour waiting times and chilly overnight temperatures, thousands of people joined the miles-long line when it reopened. Around 750,000 people are expected to file past the Queen’s coffin before her funeral on Monday. Mourners include football legend David Beckham, who braved a 13-hour wait.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> $30bn, the estimated cost of Pakistan’s floods, equivalent to 9% of GDP. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/09/15/devastating-floods-like-pakistans-will-be-more-common-in-a-warming-world).

## NATO bolsters its eastern front

Military chiefs from 30 NATO countries meet in Tallinn, the Estonian capital, on Friday to discuss the new “strategic concept” agreed at the alliance’s most recent [summit](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/06/26/nato-holds-its-most-important-summit-for-decades) in June. The aim is to shore up the eastern front and make NATO better able to respond to Russia. The alliance has changed since the invasion of Ukraine. Not only is it [expanding](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/06/28/turkey-lifts-its-block-on-letting-sweden-and-finland-join-nato), but military commanders are writing new regional defence plans as to which national forces would defend which geographic areas in the event of a war.

Last week Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary-general, said that the alliance was sending a “message to Moscow about our readiness to…defend every inch of Allied territory.” He also called for member states to send more weapons to Ukraine. Those are still needed. But Ukraine’s stunning [counter-offensive](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/11/is-russia-on-the-run) has left NATO’s number-one adversary looking weakened. A renewed air of confidence may prevail in Tallinn.

## Ramaphosa escapes the ANC to DC

When [Cyril Ramaphosa](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/cyril-ramaphosa-says-the-world-must-end-vaccine-apartheid) visits the White House on Friday he will be glad to put some distance between him and his troubles at home. South Africa’s president, who must win re-election as leader of the ruling African National Congress in December, is under pressure from internal enemies and frustrated voters. In Washington, DC, though, he can expect charm and flattery.

Almost half of African countries, including South Africa, have [declined to condemn Russia’s invasion](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/03/12/why-russia-wins-some-sympathy-in-africa-and-the-middle-east) of Ukraine at the UN. So America has sought to reaffirm its commitment to the continent. Last month Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, set out the Biden administration’s Africa strategy, promising support for development and a more equal, less patronising relationship. This reflects America’s [rivalry with China](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2022-05-28) as much as with Russia. For all its flaws, South Africa remains one of Africa’s most powerful states—and critical to realising America’s policy. Yet White House officials may find that Mr Ramaphosa has no desire to pick sides. Non-alignment suits his country just fine.

## A semblance of normality in Russia’s economy

Immediately after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, its economy appeared to be collapsing. The rouble tanked; regulators had to close the stockmarket. Economists pencilled in a GDP decline of up to 15% in 2022. 

It has [not quite worked out that way](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/23/why-the-russian-economy-keeps-beating-expectations). In one month since the invasion the rouble made up its losses. Since peaking at 17.8% in April, inflation has steadily fallen. That, along with buoyant business activity, has allowed the central bank to ease monetary policy. On Friday it cut interest rates by half a percentage point to 7.5%.

To some degree, Russia has [managed to reorient](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/23/why-the-russian-economy-keeps-beating-expectations) its trading and investment relationships eastwards. The government has also deployed judicious fiscal stimulus, while households and firms have continued to spend and invest. Most importantly, Western sanctions have largely avoided impairing Russia’s exports of oil and gas, the global prices of which have soared. That leaves the central bank free to step on the monetary gas.

## Azerbaijan attacks Armenia, Erdogan meets Putin

The guns have yet to cool in [Armenia and Azerbaijan](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/13/why-azerbaijan-and-armenia-are-fighting-again), where a deadly two-day conflict earlier this week was stopped by a truce on Thursday. Across the Caspian Sea, in Uzbekistan, Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, will take up the issue with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the sidelines of a summit on Friday.

Turkey is a firm backer of Azerbaijan. [In 2020](https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/11/12/a-peace-deal-ends-a-bloody-war-over-nagorno-karabakh) Mr Erdogan’s government supplied the country with drones, military advisers and Syrian mercenaries, enabling it to recapture the ethnic-Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. Russia, for its part, has a mutual-defence treaty with Armenia, but also has good relations with Azerbaijan. That allowed it to broker a ceasefire between the pair in 2020.

Bogged down in Ukraine, Russia wants to avoid fresh fighting. Turkey meanwhile is more likely to demand that Armenia recognise Azerbaijan’s sovereignty over Nagorno-Karabakh in exchange for peace. Mr Putin and Mr Erdogan know how to wage proxy wars while maintaining cordial relations. Expect them to agree to disagree in Uzbekistan. 

## David Bowie on screen

[David Bowie’s](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2016/01/16/starman-jones) music often dealt with his inner world, and yet he sported eye-catching costumes to perform for vast crowds. “Moonage Daydream”, Brett Morgen’s new documentary, released on Friday in America and Britain, captures Bowie in his own words, unencumbered by others’ opinions—while imparting an overwhelming sense of just how crowded his life could be.

Music biopics are having a moment, and Bowie holds obvious appeal for ambitious filmmakers. Yet “Moonage Daydream” paints a far more intimate portrait of its subject than do recent films about [Elvis](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/06/24/the-strange-case-of-elvis-presleys-musical-posterity), [Freddie Mercury](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2018/10/26/bohemian-rhapsody-is-more-fantasy-than-real-life) and [Elton John](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2019/05/20/rocketman-is-a-suitably-ostentatious-biopic-of-elton-john). Mr Morgen has carefully selected archive footage to create a razor-sharp portrait of Bowie. On occasion he overreaches: the film is more interested in Bowie&#x27;s philosophy and art than his relationships and the people around him. At one point Bowie reflects that, “I put myself through everything” to grow into the artist he became. This extraordinary, almost extreme film puts the viewer through a comparable experience.
