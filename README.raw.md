<strong>Russian missile strikes</strong> on <strong>Mykolaiv</strong>, a port city in the south of <strong>Ukraine</strong>, killed Oleksiy Vadatursky, one of the country’s richest businessmen and biggest exporters of grain. On July 22nd Russia had agreed to allow Ukraine to resume shipping grain, before [jeopardising the deal](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/22/after-agreeing-to-let-ukraine-export-grain-russia-rockets-its-port) by bombing Odessa, another port. A Ukrainian spokesman said Russia had targeted Mr Vadatursky deliberately. 

Volodymyr Zelensky, <strong>Ukraine</strong>’s president, ordered civilians to evacuate <strong>Donetsk</strong>, amid [fierce fighting ](https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis)between Russian and Ukrainian forces. Russia already controls large parts of the eastern region. The more people leave Donetsk, said Mr Zelensky, “the fewer people the Russian army will have time to kill”. Meanwhile, Russian shelling in Mykolaiv, a southern port city, killed one of Ukraine’s biggest grain exporters.

<strong>Myanmar’s</strong> military junta extended a <strong>state of emergency</strong> across the country by six months. The regime has ruled with emergency powers since overthrowing the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. Last week it reintroduced the death penalty and [executed](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/myanmar-extends-state-of-emergency-for-six-months-until-february) four activists. Generals promise new elections will be held next year, though few think that likely.

<strong>Hong Kong’s</strong> finance secretary said the territory’s economy had shrunk during the second quarter, compared with a year ago. GDP also fell substantially during the first quarter, as a debilitating wave of covid-19 infections swept the city. [Hong Kong’s](https://www.economist.com/interactive/essay/2022/07/01/how-hong-kong-became-a-police-state) strict covid rules, including lengthy quarantines for visitors, are proving a drag. Meanwhile, that policy’s aim—reopening Hong Kong’s border with the mainland—remains a distant prospect.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>New Zealand</strong> fully reopened its borders for the first time since March 2020. Visitors from all over the world can now enter the country without quarantining, though they must be vaccinated against covid-19 and take two tests on arrival. The government has been slowly loosening border restrictions since February, when it started to allow New Zealanders back in.

Hundreds of firefighters were brought in to tackle a large <strong>wildfire</strong> near Lisbon, the capital of <strong>Portugal</strong>. Weeks of drought and an [intense heatwave](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/20/todays-heatwaves-are-a-warning-of-worse-to-come) have sparked blazes in several parts of the country. Meanwhile in America, the McKinney fire in northern <strong>California</strong> has rapidly grown to become the biggest in the state this year. At least 2,000 people have been told to evacuate. 

<strong>England’s women footballers</strong> became European champions, defeating Germany in a tense final in London. It was England’s first victory in a [major football tournament](https://www.economist.com/international/2022/07/21/the-womens-euros-are-selling-out-stadiums) since the men’s team won the World Cup in 1966. Viewing figures for the final are not yet out, but more than 10m Britons watched the Lionesses’ semi-final victory, a striking figure for a country obsessed with the men’s game.

<strong>Word of the week: </strong><em>champing</em>, the practice of [camping in churches](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/07/28/britains-empty-churches-are-turning-into-campsites).

## Russia’s not-so-great navy

At the Navy Day parade in St Petersburg on Sunday, Russia will try to project an image of marine supremacy. The River Neva will host a parade of 47 combat ships, gunboats and submarines. There will be celebrations elsewhere too, including Tartus on the Syrian coast, where the Russian navy has a Mediterranean outpost.

But the absence of festivities at the port of Sevastopol, in Russian-annexed Crimea, hints at Russia’s travails: Sevastopol’s ships are busy fighting Ukraine in the Black Sea. Though Russia claims control of the sea’s north-west, its navy has suffered significant setbacks—most notably by losing [Snake Island](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/06/27/the-battle-for-snake-island), a strategic outcrop it had gained early in the invasion. And Russia is still reeling from the loss of the <em>Moskva</em>, one of its flagship missile cruisers, in April. On paper Russia’s naval power still vastly outmuscles Ukraine’s. But observers may wonder if there’s really much to celebrate on the Neva. 

## ASEAN grapples with crisis after crisis

Meetings of the ten-member Association of South-East Asian Nations are normally dull talking-shops. Yet the region has rarely been beset by so many crises. As the member states’ foreign ministers convene in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, next week, their pow-wow is bound to make headlines.

First on the agenda is Myanmar, whose murderous junta recently [executed](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/28/myanmars-brutal-junta-has-brought-back-the-death-penalty) four pro-democracy activists. ASEAN is unlikely to suspend Myanmar’s membership, but it may downgrade its representation even further and, perhaps, scrap the moribund peace deal it negotiated with the junta in 2021.

The ministers will also urge China, which claims almost all of the South China Sea, to recognise the respective claims of ASEAN members such as Indonesia and Vietnam. They will discuss the Rohingya refugee crisis as well as the war in Ukraine. Representatives from China, Russia and America will attend. Arguments and walk-outs are likely.

## Elections in Senegal

Senegal is often considered a democratic beacon in Africa. But its light may be dimming. Legislative elections on Sunday are seen as a test of strength for President Macky Sall, who may run for a constitution-bending third term in 2024. He has remained ominously vague about his intentions.

There have been numerous violent flare-ups in the country in recent years. Fourteen people died in protests in March 2021 after an opposition leader, Ousmane Sonko, was arrested and charged with rape. (He denies the allegation.) Protesters claimed it was another attempt to kneecap the president’s rivals. There were also protests last month when the constitutional council threw out an opposition group’s candidate-list because of an error. The group will still contest the election on Sunday but some big names, including Mr Sonko, are barred. Still, Mr Sall’s party was thumped in municipal elections in January. A repeat might scupper any third-term ambitions.

## Weekend profile: Pragg, India’s chess superstar

In February, Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa, a 16-year-old Indian, became the youngest person to defeat Magnus Carlsen, a five-time world chess champion and giant of the game. Any victory over Mr Carlsen is remarkable but this was comprehensive, taking just 39 moves. [Chess](https://www.economist.com/1843/2015/06/15/chess) has a rich history of such precocious exploits—Mr Carlsen himself was a teenage prodigy. But in India, a country starved of sporting success outside cricket, Pragg, as he is commonly known, became an instant superstar. On Twitter, Narendra Modi, the prime minister, and Sachin Tendulkar, a celebrated former cricketer, gushed praise. 

Although young, Pragg’s stardom has been a while in the making. He started playing at the age of three when his father, a bank employee, introduced chess to the household to distract his sister from watching TV. By the age of seven Pragg began showing signs of genius, so his father enrolled him in a chess academy—easy enough in Chennai, one of south India’s biggest cities and a breeding ground for chess champions (Viswanathan Anand, India’s best-ever player, is also a Chennaiite).

The head of the academy, RB Ramesh, a world-class player himself, was struck by his student’s dedication. While his other charges struggled to watch the ten videos he demanded of them each day, Pragg would watch 30. In between hours-long practices of complex chess manoeuvres, the pair would take a break by indulging in more child-like pursuits: playing hide-and-seek. 

The hard work paid off. At ten Pragg became the youngest-ever international master, the second-highest title in chess. Two years later he became the second-youngest player to secure the game’s highest: grandmaster. In 2019, when barely 14, he became the world under-18 champion.

This weekend he will continue his chase for glory when he competes with 2,000 players, including Mr Carlsen, at the Chess Olympiad, which started on Thursday in Mahabalipuram, near Chennai. In his matches, he will sport what has become his trademark look, sacred ash on his forehead, dabbed there for good luck. He scarcely needs it.
