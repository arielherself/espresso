<strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> signed a new doctrine that laid out the <strong>Russian navy’s</strong> strategic aims, which includes plans to become a “great maritime power” that extends over the world. The doctrine listed <strong>America </strong>and <strong>NATO </strong>as the main threats to Russia. In a speech during Navy Day celebrations, the Russian president said new hypersonic cruise-missile systems would be delivered to the navy in the coming months.

<strong>Volodymyr Zelensky</strong>, Ukraine’s president, ordered civilians to evacuate <strong>Donetsk</strong>, amid [fierce fighting ](https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis)between Russian and Ukrainian forces. Russia already controls large parts of the eastern region. Meanwhile Ukraine said it was compiling evidence that Russia perpetrated the attack that killed 53 prisoners of war in Donetsk on Friday. The Kremlin said it would welcome an “objective investigation”.

At least 69 people have been killed in flooding and mudslides in <strong>Iran</strong>. Scores more are missing. More than 20 provinces have been impacted by the recent flooding, which has damaged tens of thousands of homes. Local media report that several airports and roads have been closed and thousands of people have been evacuated from the worst-hit areas. 

Factory activity in <strong>China </strong>contracted unexpectedly in July as covid-19 outbreaks hindered manufacturing output. The official manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to 49, down from 50.2 in June and below analysts’ forecasts of 50.3. A reading below 50 indicates contraction. Flare-ups of covid in manufacturing hubs, such as Shenzhen, and weak global demand [dragged down](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/07/28/chinas-official-growth-figures-are-bad-enough-to-be-believed) the index.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency in New York, in response to the outbreak of <strong>monkeypox</strong> in her state. Monkeypox—which is similar to smallpox, though less likely to kill—is spreading across the world, including America and Europe. The World Health Organisation recently declared the outbreak a [<strong>public-health emergency</strong>](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/07/23/monkeypox-is-declared-a-global-health-emergency) of international concern. Brazil and Spain reported the first fatalities from the virus outside Africa. 

Debris from a <strong>Chinese</strong> rocket crashed into the Pacific Ocean, according to [China’s space agency](https://www.economist.com/international/2021/07/17/america-china-and-the-race-to-the-moon). Long March 5 had blasted off last week to deliver a laboratory module to a Chinese space station under construction in orbit. NASA, America’s space agency, said China had not shared any “specific trajectory information” which was needed to “ensure the safety of people here on Earth”.

A committee of <strong>Zambia’s</strong> official creditors, headed by <strong>China</strong> and <strong>France</strong>, said it had reached agreement on a restructuring of the southern African country’s [debts](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/05/14/zambia-wants-to-be-a-model-for-resolving-africas-debt-crises). Zambia stopped servicing $17bn of foreign debt in November 2020, with its economy weakened by low copper prices and the covid-19 pandemic. The deal looks likely to unlock a $1.3bn loan from the IMF.

<strong>Word of the week: </strong><em>champing</em>, the practice of [camping in churches](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/07/28/britains-empty-churches-are-turning-into-campsites).

## Russia’s not-so-great navy

At the Navy Day parade in St Petersburg on Sunday, Russia will try to project an image of marine supremacy. The River Neva will host a parade of 47 combat ships, gunboats and submarines. There will be celebrations elsewhere too, including Tartus on the Syrian coast, where the Russian navy has a Mediterranean outpost.

But the absence of festivities at the port of Sevastopol, in Russian-annexed Crimea, hints at Russia’s travails: Sevastopol’s ships are busy fighting Ukraine in the Black Sea. Though Russia claims control of the sea’s north-west, its navy has suffered significant setbacks—most notably by losing [Snake Island](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/06/27/the-battle-for-snake-island), a strategic outcrop it had gained early in the invasion. And Russia is still reeling from the loss of the <em>Moskva</em>, one of its flagship missile cruisers, in April. On paper Russia’s naval power still vastly outmuscles Ukraine’s. But observers may wonder if there’s really much to celebrate on the Neva. 

## ASEAN grapples with crisis after crisis

Meetings of the ten-member Association of South-East Asian Nations are normally dull talking-shops. Yet the region has rarely been beset by so many crises. As the member states’ foreign ministers convene in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, next week, their pow-wow is bound to make headlines.

First on the agenda is Myanmar, whose murderous junta recently [executed](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/28/myanmars-brutal-junta-has-brought-back-the-death-penalty) four pro-democracy activists. ASEAN is unlikely to suspend Myanmar’s membership, but it may downgrade its representation even further and, perhaps, scrap the moribund peace deal it negotiated with the junta in 2021.

The ministers will also urge China, which claims almost all of the South China Sea, to recognise the respective claims of ASEAN members such as Indonesia and Vietnam. They will discuss the Rohingya refugee crisis as well as the war in Ukraine. Representatives from China, Russia and America will attend. Arguments and walk-outs are likely.

## Elections in Senegal

Senegal is often considered a democratic beacon in Africa. But its light may be dimming. Legislative elections on Sunday are seen as a test of strength for President Macky Sall, who may run for a constitution-bending third term in 2024. He has remained ominously vague about his intentions.

There have been numerous violent flare-ups in the country in recent years. Fourteen people died in protests in March 2021 after an opposition leader, Ousmane Sonko, was arrested and charged with rape. (He denies the allegation.) Protesters claimed it was another attempt to kneecap the president’s rivals. There were also protests last month when the constitutional council threw out an opposition group’s candidate-list because of an error. The group will still contest the election on Sunday but some big names, including Mr Sonko, are barred. Still, Mr Sall’s party was thumped in municipal elections in January. A repeat might scupper any third-term ambitions.

## Weekend profile: Pragg, India’s chess superstar

In February, Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa, a 16-year-old Indian, became the youngest person to defeat Magnus Carlsen, a five-time world chess champion and giant of the game. Any victory over Mr Carlsen is remarkable but this was comprehensive, taking just 39 moves. [Chess](https://www.economist.com/1843/2015/06/15/chess) has a rich history of such precocious exploits—Mr Carlsen himself was a teenage prodigy. But in India, a country starved of sporting success outside cricket, Pragg, as he is commonly known, became an instant superstar. On Twitter, Narendra Modi, the prime minister, and Sachin Tendulkar, a celebrated former cricketer, gushed praise. 

Although young, Pragg’s stardom has been a while in the making. He started playing at the age of three when his father, a bank employee, introduced chess to the household to distract his sister from watching TV. By the age of seven Pragg began showing signs of genius, so his father enrolled him in a chess academy—easy enough in Chennai, one of south India’s biggest cities and a breeding ground for chess champions (Viswanathan Anand, India’s best-ever player, is also a Chennaiite).

The head of the academy, RB Ramesh, a world-class player himself, was struck by his student’s dedication. While his other charges struggled to watch the ten videos he demanded of them each day, Pragg would watch 30. In between hours-long practices of complex chess manoeuvres, the pair would take a break by indulging in more child-like pursuits: playing hide-and-seek. 

The hard work paid off. At ten Pragg became the youngest-ever international master, the second-highest title in chess. Two years later he became the second-youngest player to secure the game’s highest: grandmaster. In 2019, when barely 14, he became the world under-18 champion.

This weekend he will continue his chase for glory when he competes with 2,000 players, including Mr Carlsen, at the Chess Olympiad, which started on Thursday in Mahabalipuram, near Chennai. In his matches, he will sport what has become his trademark look, sacred ash on his forehead, dabbed there for good luck. He scarcely needs it.
