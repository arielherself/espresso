<strong>Russian</strong> forces fired at towns around the [<strong>Zaporizhia nuclear power station</strong>](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/19/what-is-at-stake-at-ukraines-zaporizhia-nuclear-plant) in the south-east of <strong>Ukraine</strong>. The plant was captured by Russian troops in March but is still run by Ukrainian staff, and, according to Russia, is being shelled by Ukrainian forces. The fighting has increased fears of a radioactive leak from the plant. Residents in Zaporizhia are being taught how to treat themselves with iodine in the event of radiation exposure.

Four associations of European judges challenged the <strong>European Council’s</strong> decision to grant <strong>Poland</strong> access to €23.9bn ($23.8bn) in grants and €11.5bn in loans. The cash had been blocked because of a dispute over the independence of Polish judges, which the European Commission said was being undermined. The judges said that Poland’s reform plans “fall short of what is required” to protect judicial independence.

The <strong>US Navy</strong> said two American warships were sailing through the <strong>Taiwan Strait</strong>, the first to do so since Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House of Representatives, [visited Taiwan](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/02/nancy-pelosis-trip-to-taiwan-highlights-americas-incoherent-strategy) this month. The navy said it was demonstrating America’s “commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific”. China—which claims Taiwan as its own and carried out large [military exercises](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/08/04/china-sends-missiles-flying-over-taiwan) in response to Ms Pelosi’s trip—said it was monitoring the ships and maintaining a high alert.

<strong>Liz Truss</strong>, the favourite to become leader of the Conservative Party and hence Britain’s prime minister, reportedly “ruled out” further direct support for those struggling with surging [energy bills](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/08/26/energy-bills-in-britain-are-soaring). <strong>Rishi Sunak</strong>, her rival for the job, said the government “must provide some direct support”. Boris Johnson, the departing leader, insisted that whoever wins on September 5th, “the government will announce another huge package of financial support”.

Lee Jae-myung, who was narrowly defeated in this year’s <strong>South Korean</strong> presidential election, was elected to lead the main opposition party. Mr Lee won nearly 78% of the vote among members of the Democratic Party. In his victory speech he criticised the administration of [Yoon Suk-yeol](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/08/25/south-koreas-president-needs-to-learn-the-basics), the conservative who won the presidential contest in March.

<strong>Angola</strong> held a funeral for its late dictator, <strong>José Eduardo dos Santos</strong>, days after [an election](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/18/a-dictators-ghost-haunts-angolas-upcoming-elections) which has been disputed by the opposition. In the general election on August 24th Mr dos Santos’s ruling party won a slim majority. But Adalaberto Costa Júnior, the opposition leader, rejected the results. The state funeral gives the authorities an excuse to clamp down on post-election protests.

Officials in <strong>Pakistan</strong> said on Sunday that the death toll from <strong>floods</strong> after heavy monsoon rains that have afflicted the country since mid-June had risen to more than 1,000. In appealing for international help on Friday, the prime minister, [Shehbaz Sharif](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2022/08/13/pakistans-prime-minister-on-his-drive-to-modernise-the-country), said that 33m of Pakistan’s 230m people had been affected by the floods.

<strong>Word of the week: </strong><em>Euskara</em>, the Basque language, which, against all odds, has seen an increase in speakers of 350,000 since the 1980s. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/08/25/the-struggle-to-preserve-regional-languages).

## Brazil’s presidential hopefuls face off

On Sunday Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s right-wing president, and Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, his main rival in the presidential election on October 2nd, are expected to face each other in a televised debate. Lula, as the left-wing former president is known, leads polls by double digits, but Mr Bolsonaro has been gaining ground thanks to recent [hefty government spending](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/08/25/brazils-president-lagging-in-the-polls-turns-to-god-and-cash). The incumbent, who likes to remind voters of Lula’s time in prison after a corruption conviction that was later annulled by the Supreme Court, has warned of a choice between “good versus evil”. Lula, who slams Mr Bolsonaro for high inflation and for mismanaging the pandemic, has said his rival is “possessed by the devil”.

The debate, which will include four other hopefuls, is sure to feature more mud-slinging. That is, if the candidates don’t drop out at the last moment. The president has wavered on whether to attend, and Lula says his appearance is conditional on that of Mr Bolsonaro.

## The joy and pain of London’s carnival

More than a million people will gyrate through Notting Hill Carnival this weekend. Europe’s biggest street party was begun in 1959 by immigrant Trinidadians, but now encompasses other Caribbean, African and South American cultures. Soca, calypso, dancehall, reggae and dub vibrate out of massive sound systems. Children parade on Sunday, while adults in <em>mas</em> (masquerade) and Brazilian samba outfits follow floats on Monday. Barbecues churn out Jamaican jerk chicken and Trinidadian roti.

Carnival celebrates diversity. But its history is of discrimination. It began in the Caribbean as a way for slaves to resist their masters. The first in west London aimed to heal communities after the race riots of 1958. In [1976](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/08/09/almost-nothing-seems-to-be-working-in-britain-it-could-get-worse) young, downtrodden black men clashed with police. In 2018 the [Windrush scandal](https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/04/18/the-national-shame-of-britains-treatment-of-windrush-migrants) saw British citizens from the Caribbean deported as illegal immigrants. The return of carnival, after a two-year hiatus, is another chance to try to heal old wounds.

## Salt ’n’ mealworm flavour crisps?

Mealworms are a beloved snack of bluebirds and hedgehogs. Spiced and fried, the beetle larvae feature at South-East Asian street markets. Last year the golden worms were also approved as a “novel food” for humans in the European Union. South Korean food scientists are now trying to also promote the taste of the protein-packed grubs. They have mapped out the flavour profiles of the meal beetle throughout its lifecycle—with aromas of wet soil, shrimp and sweetcorn—and experimented with cooking methods. 

At the meeting of the American Chemical Society this week, the scientists are showing off their best recipes. Heating powdered mealworms with sugar and garlic powder produces a distinctly “meat-like” flavour of the kind used in convenience foods such as snacks and sauces. Perfecting the caramelisation could make them contenders in the [meat-related flavour market](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2020/11/17/edible-insects-and-lab-grown-meat-are-on-the-menu), which is forecast to grow to $9bn in 2025. But the bigger crunch will be getting customers to take a bite.

## Verstappen gets his wings

Can anyone stop Max Verstappen? As the [Formula 1](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/07/14/from-monaco-to-miami-formula-1-bids-to-crack-america) season returns from its summer hiatus with the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps on Sunday, the Dutch driver has an 80-point lead with just nine of 22 races remaining. His Red Bull [car is a match for its driver](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/10/17/engineers-not-racers-are-the-true-drivers-of-success-in-motor-sport); the team is leading the constructors’ tally. There is little to suggest that either of his main rivals, Charles Leclerc of Ferrari or Sir Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes, has the consistency to beat him. 

Mr Leclerc has a superb car, but made costly errors at the French and Emilia-Romagna races. Sir Lewis, who is 32 points further back, has the opposite problem. He has raced impeccably but his car has proved sluggish and unreliable. Mr Verstappen won the 2021 season by the skin of his teeth, when he overtook Sir Lewis on the final lap amid controversy over the withdrawal of the safety car. This year he is revving up for a clear victory.

## Weekend profile: Michael Heizer, the artist behind “City”

Richard Nixon was still America’s president when Michael Heizer, one of the country’s foremost land artists, began his [mysterious sculpture project](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/08/20/a-vast-sculpture-in-the-nevada-desert-is-finished-at-last) in 1972, in the high Nevada desert north of Las Vegas. Few people were allowed to see the work in progress; many thought it would never get done. As the years passed, it took on a mythical quality in the art world.

Naysayers notwithstanding, half a century on, Mr Heizer’s “City” is complete. On September 2nd, it will open to the public—even if, to maintain its atmosphere of splendid isolation, at first only six people a day will be allowed to visit.

As an artist, Mr Heizer is almost completely self-taught. Fascinated by drawing from an early age, as a teenager in the late 1950s he helped his father, a famous anthropological archaeologist, who was excavating an ancient Olmec site on the Yucatán peninsula. Then he spent a year in Paris, mostly in its museums. “I saw it all first-hand,” he says. “You can’t go to school and learn about art by looking at a bunch of slides projected on a wall.”

The artist started work on “City”, with a huge piece at one end called “Section One”, a rectangular slope surrounded by concrete struts. “I worked entirely intuitively,” he says, “with no ongoing thought or consecutive way of planning.” The finished work is more than a mile and a half long and half a mile wide (2.4km x 800 metres), making it one of the biggest contemporary sculptures ever made. Walking through it feels as much like being in a garden—albeit one with no flowers—as in a city. There are mounds and walkways, as well as discrete spaces that could be neighbourhoods. It is both intimate and epic, forbidding and yet inviting; a work that is utterly itself. 

At 77, Mr Heizer has made his last visit to the site. He lives far away, at sea level, for the sake of his damaged lungs. But his stubbornness is undimmed; he refuses to explain the significance of the work. “It’s the visitor who does the interpretation,” he says. “I don’t give a damn.”
