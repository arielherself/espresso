<strong>Ukraine </strong>said it managed to prevent flooding after <strong>Russia </strong>bombed a dam in the southern town of <strong>Kryvyi Rih</strong>. After a series of [military defeats](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/11/is-russia-on-the-run), Russia is targeting Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure; a missile strike on Monday disabled a power station in Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city. Meanwhile, Moscow warned that if America supplied Kyiv with longer-range missiles, it would cross a “red line” and become “party to the conflict”.

<strong>Russia’s </strong>president, Vladimir Putin, acknowledged <strong>China’s</strong> “questions and concerns” about his country’s faltering invasion of Ukraine during a [meeting](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/14/what-is-the-shanghai-co-operation-organisation) with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Uzbekistan. Mr Putin condemned America’s “provocations” around [Taiwan](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/08/11/how-the-crisis-over-taiwan-will-change-us-china-relations), the self-governing island that China claims as its own territory, in August.

Rail companies and trade unions struck a tentative deal to avoid a devastating rail shutdown across <strong>America</strong>. Tens of thousands of workers in the industry were preparing to <strong>strike</strong>, which would have disrupted food and fuel supply chains and cost the economy around $2bn a day. The agreement came after 20 hours of talks brokered by Joe Biden’s administration. The president called it “a big win for America”. 

<strong>Ethereum</strong>, one of the most important [blockchain platforms](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2022/09/13/how-ethereums-merge-could-transform-crypto), successfully completed a software upgrade that will significantly reduce the amount of energy it uses. “[The merge](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/06/the-future-of-crypto-is-at-stake-in-ethereums-switch)” marks the transition from using the energy-intensive mechanism of verifying transactions, called “proof-of-work”, to the greener “proof-of-stake” method. The upgrade should also make the software project more secure and scalable.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Roger Federer</strong>, widely regarded as one of the best tennis players of all time, announced his imminent retirement. The Swiss [star](https://www.economist.com/culture/2021/08/07/roger-federer-lionel-messi-and-the-pursuit-of-greatness), who won 20 Grand Slam singles titles, said that his body had sent a “clear” message that it was time to [end his professional career](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/11/23/is-this-the-beginning-of-a-new-era-for-mens-tennis). Mr Federer’s last tournament will be the Laver Cup in London later in September.

<strong>Mark Meadows</strong>, the final chief of staff to Donald Trump, America’s former president, complied with a subpoena issued by the Department of Justice during its investigation into the [storming of the Capitol](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/29/donald-trumps-shameful-role-in-the-storming-of-the-capitol) on <strong>January 6th</strong>, according to CNN. Mr Meadows is thought to be the most senior official to have co-operated with the inquest so far.

The foreign-policy committee of <strong>America’s Senate </strong>approved [groundbreaking new support](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/08/11/how-the-crisis-over-taiwan-will-change-us-china-relations) for <strong>Taiwan</strong>, including $4.5bn in military aid. Democrats and Republicans alike voted in favour of the Taiwan Policy Act, which may put Joe Biden on a sticky wicket. Were he to sign the bill into law, <strong>China</strong>, which regards the island as a breakaway region, would erupt in outrage.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 100m, the probable number of samples in the world’s largest forensic DNA database, held at China’s ministry of public security. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/09/13/chinas-government-is-mass-collecting-dna-from-tibetans).

## France faces an energy squeeze

Like the rest of Europe, France has been battered by the [inflationary consequences](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/08/europes-energy-market-was-not-built-for-this-crisis) of Russia’s war on Ukraine. But the French have been largely protected from the worst of the blow. August’s annual inflation figure of 5.9%, released on Thursday, confirms that prices have been rising more modestly in France than elsewhere in Europe. This is mainly because President Emmanuel Macron’s government has been spending heavily to insulate consumers from soaring energy prices. On Wednesday it said it would further limit gas and electricity price rises for households to 15% next year.

France has also been partly shielded from the tumult in global gas prices by its unusual dependence on nuclear power, which provides 42% of its energy supply. Still, this nuclear preponderance currently presents its own challenge. France is usually a net exporter of electricity. But over half of its 56 [nuclear reactors](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/28/frances-nuclear-plants-are-going-down-for-repairs) are down for maintenance. That has left the country having to import electricity at high wholesale prices.

## Xi and Putin talk shop in Samarkand

Western leaders are not invited to the [Shanghai Co-operation Organisation’s](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/14/what-is-the-shanghai-co-operation-organisation) summit, which takes place in Uzbekistan on Thursday and Friday. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, met his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the event to discuss Ukraine and Taiwan. Some other attendees, including Iran’s president, Ebrahim Rasi, share the pair’s anti-American worldview.

But the West has nothing to fear from the SCO. Founded by China, Russia and four Central Asian states in 2001, it is largely a talking-shop that focuses on regional economic and security issues. It is known for its ineffectiveness, made worse by a string of enlargements. India and Pakistan joined in 2017, importing to the SCO their fraught historical relationship. Iran’s accession, agreed in 2021, imperils consensus, too. Mr Xi and Mr Putin may wax lyrical about their visions of a “multipolar” world, but the SCO itself will focus on more grounded topics, such as the construction of two [Chinese-backed railway lines](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/09/06/two-new-railway-lines-could-transform-central-asia) in Central Asia.

## A rail strike narrowly avoided in America

Much of American industry runs on rails. Nearly a third of domestic cargo shipments are moved by train. A strike can [wreak havoc with supply chains](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/01/29/why-supply-chain-problems-arent-going-away). So it came as a relief when on Thursday morning America’s 115,000 railway workers called off a planned strike at the very last minute. For two years their unions and railway bosses had failed to agree on a pay deal. But following all-night talks, brokered by the Biden administration, freight rail companies and unions agreed to a pay rise of 24% over five years.

Union members will still need to ratify the deal. But the big train firms have worries beyond this dispute. Staff shortages, exacerbated by years of lay-offs, have slowed service. Regulators are irked. The head of the Surface Transportation Board has scolded carriers for their “attitude of indifference” and promised more oversight. But Mr Biden believes the deal could go some way in fixing that problem, too, by making it easier to retain and recruit workers.

## Britain’s queen lies in state

One week after the [death of Queen Elizabeth II](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2022/09/08/elizabeth-ii-never-laid-down-the-heavy-weight-of-the-crown), Thursday marks the first full day of her lying in state in London. Up to 750,000 people are expected to queue for miles to glimpse her coffin in Westminster Hall.

Lying in state is observed by many countries. In Britain it is the preserve of sovereigns, their consorts and select prime ministers. The modern tradition of lying in state at Westminster Hall started in 1898 with prime minister William Gladstone. Queen Victoria declined the honour. Her son, Edward VII, became the first monarch to do so, in 1910. 

Elizabeth’s coffin is guarded by a vigil of soldiers. Her four children will take a turn, too. That ritual is the “Vigil of the Princes”. Yet in Scotland this week Anne, the Princess Royal, became the first woman ever to take part. In death as in life, the queen coaxes the royal family a little further into the modern world.

## Ukraine’s pirouettes of patriotism

An old conservatory in The Hague has become a haven for more than 50 [ballet dancers](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/06/30/a-ukrainian-ballerina-goes-to-war) forced by war to flee Ukraine. Spurred into action by Igone de Jongh, a Dutch former prima ballerina who became their artistic director, and supported by English and Dutch ballet companies, the dancers formed the United Ukrainian Ballet.

This week the group performs “Giselle”, a romantic tragedy, at the Coliseum in London. For the dancers in exile, every <em>penché</em> and pirouette is felt to be an act of patriotism—and a moment of respite from thoughts of war. Ballet is a “way to express my emotions…not to hold everything inside”, says Oleksii Kniazkov, a dancer from Kharkiv. Alexei Ratmansky, a luminary choreographer who grew up in Kyiv, is working with the company. The themes of hope and forgiveness in “Giselle” resonate, he explains. “It’s telling us that love is stronger than death.” That is worth dancing for.
