<strong>American share prices </strong>tumbled amid mounting economic anxiety and the prospect of steeper interest-rate rises. The S&amp;P 500 index closed at its lowest level this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average entered “bear-market” territory, 20% below its January high. Earlier the <strong>pound</strong> fell back against the dollar after the Bank of England said it would “not hesitate to change interest rates”—but would not raise them yet. [Sterling](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/26/the-pound-is-plumbing-near-historical-depths-why) was still above its nadir, below $1.04, reached earlier on Monday.

Demonstrations against <strong>Vladimir Putin’s</strong> [military mobilisation](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/21/vladimir-putin-declares-a-partial-mobilisation) continued in the Russian republic of <strong>Dagestan,</strong> which has already provided a disproportionately high number of soldiers to the war in Ukraine. A man was detained for shooting and seriously wounding a recruitment officer at a draft office in Irkutsk, a region in southeastern Siberia, the latest in a series of similar attacks.

<strong>Cubans </strong>voted in a national referendum to allow same-sex couples to marry and adopt children. The electoral commission said 67% voted in favour of the new “family code”, which also legalises surrogate pregnancies and expands grandparents’ rights over their grandchildren. Cuba’s [communist president](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/03/26/cubas-dictatorship-has-a-cultural-opposition-that-it-cant-tolerate), Miguel Diaz-Canel, said the new law would “pay off a debt to several generations”.

As [protests](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/22/why-iranian-women-are-burning-their-hijabs) in<strong> Iran</strong> continued to spread, the country’s foreign ministry accused America and some European countries of attempting to violate its sovereignty by supporting them. At least 41 people have died during ten days of demonstrations sparked by the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman detained apparently for wearing a loose hijab.

Residents of Tampa, Florida, and the surrounding county were ordered to evacuate in advance of <strong>Hurricane Ian’s</strong> expected landfall later this week. With winds of around 85mph (137kph), Ian is projected to hit western Cuba early on Tuesday before strengthening and reaching Tampa on Thursday morning. The city has not been directly hit by a hurricane since 1921.

<strong>Edward</strong> <strong>Snowden</strong>, a whistleblower long wanted by American authorities on espionage charges, was granted <strong>Russian</strong> citizenship. Mr [Snowden](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2017/01/14/how-edward-snowden-changed-history) has been living in exile in Russia since 2013, the year that he leaked secret files revealing the vast surveillance operations of America’s National Security Agency, where he once worked as a contractor.

Viktor Orban, <strong>Hungary’s</strong> prime minister, said sanctions against Russia had “backfired” and that Europeans had become poorer as a result of [rising energy prices](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/08/how-to-deal-with-europes-energy-crisis). Hungary, he said in a speech to parliament, was “waiting for an answer from Brussels on how long we will keep doing this”. Long dovish towards Russia, Mr Orban urged a ceasefire to end the war.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> $45bn, the amount spent by institutional investors snapping up single-family rental homes in America last year, up from $3bn in 2020. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/22/why-wall-street-is-snapping-up-family-homes).

## A bleak warning about the global economy

According to the OECD’s latest economic outlook, the global economy is slowing faster than it had previously anticipated. The club of rich countries expects growth to “remain subdued” for the rest of this year, before “slowing further” in 2023 to just 2.2%. It blames Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, monetary tightening around the world and the lockdowns associated with China’s covid-19 policy for the downbeat forecast.

Adding to the gloom, a growing number of economists are sure that [Europe’s economy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/31/europe-is-heading-for-recession-how-bad-will-it-be) will soon be shrinking, as higher energy prices bite into household consumption. For now, however, America looks surprisingly robust. The world’s largest economy is still creating jobs; recent surveys of manufacturing have looked fine, if not great; and consumer confidence seems to be rising as the [price of petrol](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/09/16/the-falling-cost-of-petrol-is-good-news-for-joe-biden) falls. But with the outlook for [inflation](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/05/for-a-change-american-inflation-is-lower-than-expected) so unclear, and the Federal Reserve rapidly [raising interest rates](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/21/as-america-raises-rates-the-rest-of-the-world-bears-the-pain), you would be brave to bet that pain can be entirely avoided this winter.

## Relations between Colombia and Venezuela

An important South American border crossing will fully reopen on Monday. Amid a thawing of relations between Colombia and Venezuela, vehicles carrying passengers and goods will be able to cross between the two countries for the first time since 2019. 

The border was shut when Colombia’s then-president, [Iván Duque](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/06/20/can-colombias-president-ivan-duque-find-his-feet), refused to recognise [Nicol](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/08/18/venezuelas-dictator-is-less-isolated-than-he-once-was)[á](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/06/20/can-colombias-president-ivan-duque-find-his-feet)[s Maduro](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/08/18/venezuelas-dictator-is-less-isolated-than-he-once-was) as Venezuela’s leader after disputed elections in 2018. The election in June of [Gustavo Petro](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/06/who-is-gustavo-petro), a leftist, as Colombia’s president has improved relations. New ambassadors have been appointed. Flights will also resume.

The opening should help both economies. Exports from Colombia to Venezuela, such as palm oil, were only worth $331m last year. Colombia’s trade minister reckons the figure could reach $1.2bn this year—double previous estimates. But that relies on Venezuela’s fragile economic [recovery](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2019/01/31/how-venezuelas-economy-can-recover-from-the-maduro-regime) continuing. Colombia’s exports to Venezuela had already fallen after Venezuela’s [economic collapse](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2015/01/22/empty-shelves-and-rhetoric) in 2014. And the neighbours will also have to tackle gang activity and rampant smuggling across the border.

## France’s budget

On Monday the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, unveiled the government’s budget for 2023. He faced a difficult balancing act. France has promised to bring the government’s budget deficit down to 3% of GDP by 2027. But Mr Le Maire confirmed that next year’s figure will be 5%. France will have to spend heavily to[ subsidise energy bills](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/05/europe-scrambles-to-protect-citizens-from-sky-high-energy-prices), as promised. To protect consumers from inflation the government will cap price rises for electricity and gas bills to 15%. 

France also needs to demonstrate its fiscal responsibility. The European Commission has suspended the enforcement of its fiscal rules, which require deficits under 3%, until 2024. But the French deficit is closer to that of Spain and Portugal than Germany. So President[ Emmanuel Macron](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/15/frances-president-emmanuel-macron-gets-back-to-work) is also keen to press ahead with his promise to raise the retirement age from 62 years old to 64 or 65. Adding this to the budget as an amendment, which remains an option, would demonstrate reformist zeal, but could also prompt demonstrations and[ strikes](https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/09/12/another-french-president-tries-pension-reform).

## The forgotten war in Myanmar

The ongoing bloodshed in [Myanmar](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2022/06/23/the-seven-books-to-read-about-myanmar) might draw more attention were it not for the war in Ukraine. The latest outrage occurred on September 16th when the army attacked the village of Let Yet Kone, in the north-west of the country. A school was fired on by helicopter gunships, killing at least 11 children and two adults. The incident will doubtless feature in a report to the UN Human Rights Council on Monday when it devotes a session to the country. 

Since the army seized power in a coup last year the situation in Myanmar has deteriorated rapidly. The UN says that over 13m people are short of food. Over 1m have been displaced as the army battles against an increasingly well-organised [opposition](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/18/myanmars-shadow-government-deserves-more-help). Many countries have reimposed sanctions on Myanmar, but arguments will be made at the UN that there is more to be done to cut off the junta’s access to revenues and arms. Whatever has been tried so far to deter Myanmar’s [murderous generals](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/28/myanmars-brutal-junta-has-brought-back-the-death-penalty) clearly has not worked.

## NASA’s crash with an asteroid

The Earth’s defences, and the plots of science-fiction films, will be tested on Monday when DART, a space probe weighing 600kg will be crashed into Dimorphos, a small rock in orbit around a larger one, Didymos. The intention of the [Double Asteroid Redirection Test](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/an-exploration-of-earths-defences-will-launch-next-month/21805517) is to shorten Dimorphos’s orbital period, now 11.9 hours, by about ten minutes. That will test the feasibility of deflecting such an asteroid, should one be discovered which threatens to collide with Earth. 

If something the size of Didymos (780 metres in diameter) hit Earth it could take out half a continent. But even the explosion of an object as small as Dimorphos, at 160 metres across, would be equivalent to 400-600 megatonnes of TNT. By comparison, the blast from an asteroid which detonated over Siberia in 1908, flattening 2,000 square kilometres of forest, released something like 20 megatonnes. The hope is that if such an incoming object were to be discovered, a gentle nudge would cause it to miss.
