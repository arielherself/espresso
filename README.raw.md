<strong>Russia</strong> bombed the water system of <strong>Kryvyi Rih</strong>, a southern Ukrainian town, including a dam, causing officials to advise a mass evacuation. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, called Russia “weaklings who fight civilians”. Meanwhile Mr Zelensky emerged unscathed from a car accident in Kyiv, the capital. He was returning from the city of Izyum, which was liberated during Ukraine’s [recent counter-offensive](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/11/is-russia-on-the-run).

The foreign-policy committee of <strong>America’s Senate</strong> approved [groundbreaking new support](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/08/11/how-the-crisis-over-taiwan-will-change-us-china-relations) for <strong>Taiwan</strong>, including $4.5bn in military aid. Democrats and Republicans alike voted in favour of the Taiwan Policy Act, which may put Joe Biden on a sticky wicket. Were he to sign the bill into law, <strong>China</strong>, which regards the island as a breakaway region, would erupt in outrage

The <strong>European Commission’s</strong> president, Ursula von der Leyen, outlined plans for a windfall tax on energy companies that will aim to raise €140bn ($140bn). The levy would be used by member states to shield consumers and businesses from [sky-high](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/05/europe-scrambles-to-protect-citizens-from-sky-high-energy-prices) energy prices resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Mrs von der Leyen suggested the EU was “in for the long haul” in Ukraine.

<strong>Sweden’s</strong> Social Democratic prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, conceded defeat in [the country’s general election](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/12/swedens-election-remains-too-close-to-call) and will resign on Thursday. Right-wing parties may be on course for a three-seat majority. Ulf Kristersson of the centre-right Moderates will lead talks between them to form a government. The bloc includes the anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats, which came second in the popular vote—although they are unlikely to be offered cabinet positions.

<strong>Armenia</strong> and <strong>Azerbaijan</strong> agreed to a truce after a couple of days of fighting, according to a senior Armenian official. An earlier ceasefire, which <strong>Russia</strong> claimed to have brokered, had already fallen apart, with [each of the Caucasian adversaries](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/13/why-azerbaijan-and-armenia-are-fighting-again) blaming the other. Over in the Central Asian bit of the former Soviet Union, armed forces belonging to <strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong> and <strong>Tajikistan</strong> clashed across their border.

California filed an <strong>antitrust case</strong> against <strong>Amazon</strong>, claiming that the e-retailer penalises merchants for selling their wares on other sites at cheaper prices. This amounts to preventing price competition through “coerced agreements”, the state’s attorney-general argued. In a separate antitrust case, <strong>Google</strong> lost an appeal before a court of the European Union on Wednesday, leaving it on the hook for a [record-breaking](https://www.economist.com/business/2018/07/21/google-is-fined-eu43bn-in-the-biggest-ever-antitrust-penalty) €4.1bn ($4.1bn) fine.

The 83-year-old founder of <strong>Patagonia</strong>, a privately held maker of outdoor apparel based in California, [pledged all of its future profits](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2022/09/14/people-trust-executives-to-intervene-in-social-issues-says-jeffrey-sonnenfeld) to fighting climate change. Yvon Chouinard said he had set up a charity to disburse Patagonia’s profits, which amount to about $100m a year. He said the arrangement was preferable to selling Patagonia and donating the proceeds, or taking the company public.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 350, the number of mortgage boycotts estimated to be taking place across China. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/12/chinas-ponzi-like-property-market-is-eroding-faith-in-the-state).

## Xi Jinping’s first post-covid trip

Nearly 1,000 days after he [last left China](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/09/08/xi-jinping-will-at-last-venture-abroad-again), President Xi Jinping arrived in Central Asia on Wednesday. A summit of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation in Uzbekistan on Thursday and Friday offers Mr Xi an opportunity to support a fellow delegate: Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. Mr Xi’s first stop, though, is Kazakhstan.

China has invested heavily in the country, which sends back oil and gas. It was from Kazakhstan that Mr Xi in 2013 launched the [Belt and Road Initiative](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/05/14/what-is-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative), a global infrastructure binge. The country also borders China’s Muslim-majority Xinjiang province, where more than 1m Uyghurs have been thrown into “re-education” camps. Kazakhstan’s government has remained quiet on the matter.

In October Mr Xi is expected to secure an unprecedented third term as chief at a Communist Party congress. Travelling now looks like a sign of confidence. But he faces big challenges at home, not least over [frustration](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/09/08/public-patience-with-zero-covid-is-wearing-thin-in-china) with his “zero-covid” policy. For now, only diplomacy is returning to the pre-pandemic normal.

## The return of the Detroit motor show

For the first time since the pandemic the latest cars are being shown off in Motor City. Many of them will be [electric](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/06/02/the-electric-vehicle-revolution-is-not-happening-fast-enough). The North American International Auto Show, in Detroit, opened for journalists and industry insiders on Wednesday. President Joe Biden attended, to [promote](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/09/13/joe-bidens-industrial-policy-is-big-bold-and-fraught-with-difficulty) the investments in electric-car manufacturing that his infrastructure and [climate-change laws](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/08/americas-climate-plus-spending-bill-is-flawed-but-essential) aim to boost.  
  
 Yet not everyone in Detroit is convinced that electric cars offer all the solutions. Some worry that their simplicity threatens the region’s engineering expertise, built on the combustion engine. Firms like Tesla and [Rivian](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/11/10/rivians-giant-listing-comes-amid-huge-losses) do not make cars in Detroit. A wider worry is that EVs, which tend to be weightier than those which run on petrol, may bring fresh dangers to American roads. Road deaths are rising, and heavier vehicles are deadlier in crashes. Among the heaviest is the four-tonne Hummer EV—which is manufactured in Detroit.

## Google’s latest day in court

On Wednesday Google’s parent company, Alphabet, largely lost its appeal against the European Commission’s decision in 2018 to [impose a record anti-trust fine](https://www.economist.com/business/2018/07/21/google-is-fined-eu43bn-in-the-biggest-ever-antitrust-penalty) of €4.3bn (then $5.1bn). The European Union’s executive branch said the firm’s licensing of its Android operating system to handset-makers had illegally helped it maintain its dominant position in the smartphone market. Judges at a court of the European Court of Justice upheld many of the arguments but decided that a modestly reduced fine of €4.1bn ($4.1bn) was more appropriate.

The case was the latest in a series in which the European Commission has tried to rein in America’s tech giants. Last year Alphabet also lost an appeal against [an antitrust fine](https://www.economist.com/business/2017/07/01/the-european-commission-levies-a-huge-fine-on-google) of €2.4bn, imposed by the commission in 2017 for abusing its monopoly in online search. But the court’s decisions have swung both ways. In June the court threw out a €1bn antitrust [fine against Qualcomm](https://www.economist.com/business/2018/01/27/qualcomm-is-fined-for-anti-competitive-practices-again), a big chip designer.

## The state of the European Union

How will Europe [get through winter](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/08/how-to-deal-with-europes-energy-crisis) without the Russian gas it has previously relied on? On Wednesday Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission’s president, proposed to raise €140bn ($140bn) through windfall taxes on energy companies to ease the burden of rising prices on households and businesses. During her annual “state of the union” address to the European Parliament Mrs von der Leyen said that it was “wrong” for companies to make record profits as a result of the war in Ukraine.

The bloc is also discussing energy price caps and mandatory limits on electricity demand. Mrs von der Leyen called energy markets [unfit for purpose](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/08/europes-energy-market-was-not-built-for-this-crisis) as they allowed the high price of gas to drive up electricity costs. Energy ministers from the EU’s 27 member states will thrash out the details at a meeting on September 30th. The priority will be for Europe to present a united front, even as it faces recession.

## The great crypto merge

In the early hours of Thursday morning a [major change](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/06/the-future-of-crypto-is-at-stake-in-ethereums-switch) in the architecture of crypto took place. Ethereum, the most important blockchain platform, changed the way it is run. Ethereum currently uses an energy-intensive mechanism called “proof-of-work” to verify transactions. But at around 4am GMT (equivalent to UCT, the benchmark time standard used by developers) it “merged” with a new chain that uses “proof-of-stake”, a verification method that uses much less energy.  
  
 The environmental advantage is the most obvious reason for even those who take no interest in crypto to care about “the Merge”. But it is not the only one. The event is the first in a series of upgrades that should make Ethereum more efficient and scalable—and potentially more useful. That is assuming all goes smoothly, of course. Implementing the switch is like swapping the engine of a spaceship mid-flight. Time to find out if it can be done.
