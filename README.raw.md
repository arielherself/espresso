<strong>Britain’s </strong>chancellor, [Jeremy Hunt](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/17/britains-chancellor-leaves-the-hard-choices-to-the-next-government), delivered a [budget](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/11/17/jeremy-hunts-autumn-statement-revives-the-rhetoric-of-austerity) including spending cuts and tax rises that by 2027-28 will be worth £62bn ($73bn), or 2.1% of GDP. He hopes it will restore Britain’s fiscal credibility after his predecessor damaged it with a programme of unfunded tax cuts. Mr Hunt froze the tax thresholds for income tax, national insurance and inheritance tax, meaning that pay rises will push taxpayers into higher tax bands. State pensions, benefits and tax credits will rise by 10.1%, September’s inflation rate. Most government departments will see their budgets rise by less than the rate of inflation.

<strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> announced she will step down from her role as leader of the Democratic Party in <strong>America’s House of Representatives, </strong>a position she has held since 2003. Ms Pelosi, who was the first woman to lead either major party in Congress, will continue to serve as a representative from California. Earlier, the Republican Party narrowly [regained control](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/17/in-a-republican-house-investigations-and-fiscal-clashes-loom) of the House; Ms Pelosi’s replacement will now be in the minority.

A Dutch court ruled that <strong>flight MH17</strong>, a Malaysian Airlines plane shot down over Ukraine in 2014, was hit by a <strong>Russian-made missile</strong> system fired by a Kremlin-controlled militia. Two Russians and one Ukrainian were found guilty of murder for [downing the passenger plane](https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/03/08/the-dutch-put-four-men-on-trial-for-shooting-down-flight-mh17), killing 298 people. All three men have been handed life sentences, but are unlikely to be extradited to the Netherlands.

<strong>Alibaba</strong>, a Chinese e-commerce giant, reported weak third-quarter growth with revenues reaching 207bn yuan ($29bn), a rise of only 3% compared with the same period a year earlier. China’s zero-covid policy has hurt the firm by hampering consumer spending. On November 11th “Singles’ Day”, when Chinese shoppers usually splurge online, was met with a lukewarm response.

The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, confirmed that [an agreement](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/28/will-the-grain-deal-between-russia-and-ukraine-reduce-global-hunger) with Russia to allow <strong>Ukraine</strong> to export <strong>grain</strong> by sea, despite an ongoing Russian blockade, would be extended by 120 days. Mr Guterres also said the UN was “fully committed” to facilitating Russian export of food and fertiliser. Russia wants to export ammonia, a vital ingredient in fertiliser, through a pipeline running into Odessa, a Ukrainian port. 

The newly-installed CEO of <strong>FTX</strong> denounced the “complete failure of corporate controls” and “absence of trustworthy financial information” at the collapsed crypto exchange. In a filing to federal bankruptcy court, John Ray said it was the worst situation he had seen in 40 years of overseeing liquidations. [FTX filed for bankruptcy](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/17/is-this-the-end-of-crypto) last week, leaving behind some 1m creditors and triggering investigations by America’s Justice Department, its House Financial Services Committee and several regulators.

<strong>Italy’s Catholic bishops</strong> released the country’s first report documenting cases of<strong> sex abuse</strong> by members of the clergy. They also revealed that they were researching more than 600 cases on file at the Vatican dating back to 2000. But after decades of inaction, the report itself is[ disappointing](https://www.economist.com/international/2022/07/14/catholic-reformers-want-big-changes-to-a-church-marred-by-sex-abuse) in scope: limited to allegations reported to Italian church authorities within the past two years, it identified just 89 presumed victims.

<strong>Correction:</strong> Thursday’s fact of the day stated that there are forecast to be 300m fewer international tourist trips taken in 2023 than were taken in 2019. The difference is forecast to be 200m. Sorry.

## Britain’s autumn budget

Jeremy Hunt, Britain’s chancellor, presented a budget designed to restore the country’s fiscal credibility. The previous prime minister and chancellor had severely damaged it with a programme of unfunded tax increases, which drove up interest rates and weakened the pound. Mr Hunt has now announced spending cuts and tax rises that by 2027-28 will be worth £62bn ($73bn), or 2.1% of GDP. They will hit an economy that, as Mr Hunt confirmed, is almost certainly already in recession. 

The chancellor froze several tax thresholds, meaning that pay rises will push taxpayers into higher bands. Most government departments will see their budgets fall by 0.7% per year in real terms after 2025. But extra money was promised to health, social care and education. State pensions, benefits and tax credits were protected: they will rise by 10.1%, in line with September’s inflation rate. 

Mr Hunt says an extra £3.3bn a year for two years will be enough for the [NHS](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/11/10/the-night-watchman-welfare-state) to “fulfil its key priorities”. Other departments will struggle to make the “efficiencies” demanded of them. Household finances are already [stretched](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/11/03/britains-next-recession-may-have-already-begun). Mr Hunt insists that his plan will lower inflation next year. Two months after his predecessor promised lower taxes and higher growth, British citizens will be paying more in return for less. Mr Hunt will argue that his fiscal medicine is necessary. But it will not go down easily.

## A new leader for America’s Catholics

On Thursday American bishops meet in Baltimore as the plenary assembly of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops wraps up. Earlier this week the bishops elected Timothy Broglio, the archbishop for the armed forces, as their national president. He will be an important voice for the church, notably in the battle over [abortion](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/11/where-abortion-was-on-the-ballot-americans-voted-to-protect-it) in America.

Archbishop Broglio was not the most ardent pro-life campaigner on the ballot. But the bishops’ hard line on abortion is unlikely to change under his leadership. He supported a religious exemption for covid-19 vaccines, on the grounds that some jabs were developed using cells derived from aborted foetal tissue. His new deputy, Archbishop William Lori, has chaired the conference’s committee on pro-life activities.

The conference is out of step with many American Catholics. According to Pew Research Centre, a think-tank, more than half believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. 

## Burberry’s buoyant six months

Though high-street clothing retailers have struggled in 2022, it has been a good year to [tailor the rich](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/10/06/fashion-gets-a-modern-makeover). With their customers less at the mercy of inflation, many luxury fashion brands have enjoyed bumper profits. On Thursday Burberry, a classic British brand, reported a strong £1.3bn ($1.6bn) in sales for the first half of their financial year, with profit higher than the same period in 2019, before the pandemic.

On the same day Burberry’s chief executive, Jonathan Akeroyd, unveiled his plan to compete with European rivals, by increasing sales of accessories. He is also emphasising the brand’s Britishness—previously he replaced former creative director Riccardo Tisci, an Italian, with Daniel Lee, a Yorkshireman.

The brand’s future, however, lies closer to Beijing than Bradford. Burberry made £1.3bn last year from Asia, almost half its total. But sales in China, its biggest Asian market, have been hurt by the country’s zero-covid policy. Some analysts predict that China’s luxury market will recover in 2023; Mr Akeroyd will be hoping they are right.

## Indonesia’s economy is ready to boom

Like much of the world, Indonesia is battling inflation. In October prices rose by 5.7% year on year, well above the Bank Indonesia’s target of 2-4%. So on Thursday policymakers increased interest rates for the fourth consecutive month, by half a percentage point to 5.25%. Indonesia’s [economic prospects](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/11/14/indonesia-is-poised-for-a-boom-politics-permitting), however, are bright.  
  
 The economy grew at an annual rate of 5.7% in real terms in the quarter ending in September, the fastest pace in over a year. Foreign investment has poured into the country’s metals-processing sector, which draws on abundant deposits of nickel and other metals. Exports are booming as demand for other natural resources, such as [palm oil](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/04/02/indonesia-the-worlds-biggest-producer-has-a-palm-oil-crisis), has risen. 

Joko Widodo, Indonesia’s president, has managed the economy well, keeping government debt low and reintroducing a deficit cap. But that also presents a challenge. Jokowi, as he is known, must step down at the end of his second term, in 2024. His successor may not guide the economy as well as he has.

## The Latin Grammy Awards

It has been a bumper year for [Latin music](https://www.economist.com/business/2017/09/21/streaming-has-pushed-latin-music-into-the-mainstream). In March Anitta became the first Brazilian singer to top [Spotify’s global song chart](https://www.economist.com/interactive/graphic-detail/2022/01/29/what-spotify-data-show-about-the-decline-of-english). Bad Bunny, a Puerto Rican who was the most-streamed artist on Spotify in 2020 and 2021, has smashed records again in 2022. When his album “Un Verano Sin Ti” (“A Summer Without You”) was released on May 6th, Bad Bunny became then the most-streamed artist on a single day ever. 

On Thursday, at the Latin Grammy Awards in Las Vegas, the acts will probably win industry plaudits, too. Bad Bunny leads with ten nominations; Anitta’s hit single “Envolver” (“Involved”) is up for record of the year. Others with a good chance of success include Camilo, a Colombian singer-songwriter; and Edgar Barrera, a Mexican musician. Latin music is also gaining more recognition at international awards shows: “Un Verano” is shortlisted for album of the year at America’s Grammys in February 2023, a first for a Spanish-language record.
