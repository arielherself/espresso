American stockmarkets jumped after <strong>Jerome Powell</strong>, the chairman of the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong>, said that “the time for moderating the pace of rate increases” was imminent. The S&amp;P 500 leapt by 3% at his suggestion that interest rates would rise by only half a percentage point in December, following [four straight increases](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/02/the-fed-delivers-another-jumbo-rate-rise-and-its-far-from-done) of three-quarters of a point, and the Dow exited bear territory. Asian currencies leapt too, on the prospect of the dollar losing ground.

The European Council’s president, <strong>Charles Michel</strong>, raised “the response of societies” to <strong>covid-19 measures</strong> during a meeting with the Chinese president, <strong>Xi Jinping</strong>, in Beijing, an apparent reference to the [widespread protests](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/11/27/unrest-breaks-out-across-china-as-frustration-at-lockdowns-grows) in China. Mr Michel also brought up [Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/09/15/xi-jinping-wont-ditch-vladimir-putin-for-now) and [Taiwan](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/04/23/how-to-deter-china-from-attacking-taiwan), according to his spokesperson. On Wednesday Chongqing and Guangzhou, two of <strong>China’s </strong>biggest cities, said that they would ease some covid restrictions.

<strong>Russia</strong> continued its attacks on<strong> Ukraine&#x27;s</strong> eastern Donbas region, the area of most intense fighting, while also bombing Kherson in the south, the Ukrainian army said. Meanwhile, <strong>NATO </strong>foreign ministers agreed to bolster support for Bosnia, Georgia and Moldova. And America signed a $1.2bn contract to purchase six NASAMS [air-defence](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/11/06/western-air-defence-systems-help-ukraine-shoot-down-more-missiles) systems for <strong>Ukraine</strong>; it will send eight in total. 

<strong>South Africa’s</strong> foreign minister, Naledi Pandor, called the publication of an independent report—which suggested that the country’s president, <strong>Cyril Ramaphosa</strong>, probably [violated anti-corruption laws](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/06/23/allegations-of-impropriety-weaken-south-africas-president)—a “troubling moment”. The findings increase the likelihood that Mr Ramaphosa will be impeached. He stands accused of covering up the theft of at least $4m from his cattle farm to avoid public disclosure of his ownership, which he denies.

<strong>Florida </strong>will withdraw some $2bn of its assets from BlackRock, an American asset manager, as state treasury officials say the company is focusing too heavily on [environmental, social and governance policies](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/16/the-tenacity-of-esg-investing) instead of producing returns. The move comes amid growing criticism of <strong>ESG</strong> among Republicans. Louisiana and Missouri, also Republican-controlled states, made similar announcements in October.

<strong>Spain</strong> said that six <strong>letter-bombs</strong> were sent to addresses across the country in recent days: Pedro Sánchez, the prime minister, and Margarita Robles, the defence minister, were among the intended targets. One device sent to the Ukrainian embassy in Madrid injured a security officer on Wednesday. Spanish officials said the bombs were homemade and had been sent from inside the country. 

<strong>Football World Cup: Australia</strong> shocked <strong>Denmark</strong> to secure a place in the knockout round for only the second time in the team’s history. That sparked wild celebrations down under, despite the match finishing in the early hours of the antipodean morning. Today Germany will try to join the Socceroos in the next stage. They face Costa Rica in the first match to be refereed by a woman at a men’s World Cup.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>$170bn, the worldwide revenues of the games industry this year, five times the global box office. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/11/29/microsoft-activision-blizzard-and-the-future-of-gaming).

## A diplomatic dance in China for a top Eurocrat

Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, met with Xi Jinping, China’s president, in Beijing on Thursday. China is keen to reignite its relationship with Europe after years of pandemic-imposed isolation—Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, visited in November, and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, is expected early next year.

Mr Michel reportedly used his time with Mr Xi to raise the “respective measures taken and the response of societies” to covid-19. That is a delicate allusion to the widespread protests against zero-covid restrictions that have swept China, and the police’s heavy-handed reaction. Mr Michel needed to be cautious—China needs little excuse to blame “foreign forces” for inciting domestic unrest.

European leaders also want Mr Xi to lean on President Vladimir Putin to end his invasion of Ukraine. At the meeting Mr Xi said how the “Ukraine crisis” must be solved through political means, an oft-repeated sentiment among Chinese officials, who refuse to condemn Russia’s war. 

## Spain sets its sights on startups

Spain is not the easiest place to do business. It has good infrastructure and little petty corruption. But its legal traditions—in which it can seem as if everything not expressly permitted is forbidden—and unwieldy bureaucracy can make starting and growing a company harder than it should be.

The government hopes that a new law will change that, at least for startups. The bill, which should pass through the lower house of parliament on Thursday, aims to lighten the load for founders by offering lower taxes, more favourable tax treatment for stock options and other benefits for companies that are less than five years old and that generate less than €10m ($10m) in annual revenue.

The law should make life easier for “[digital nomads](https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/10/02/why-europe-is-a-great-place-for-digital-nomads)” who fancy a move to Spain, too. Non-EU nationals will be able to apply for a simplified visa and pay a lower rate of tax while working remotely from the country, provided that their paying clients are mainly based abroad. 

## A challenge to India’s opposition in Gujarat

On Thursday voters head to the polls to elect a local government in Gujarat, a state of 70m people in western India. The result is practically guaranteed. The Bharatiya Janata Party—which also rules the country—has won the last six elections in Gujarat. Still, the party is not taking any chances. Narendra Modi, the BJP prime minister who rose to national prominence as Gujarat’s leader, has attended dozens of rallies in the run-up to the election.

But watch the battle for second place. That spot has usually gone to Congress, India’s [hapless national opposition party](https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/11/27/narendra-modis-secret-weapon-a-useless-opposition). But this time it faces competition from Aam Aadmi Party, a newish populist group. The AAP recently beat the BJP and Congress in elections in Punjab, a northern state. In Gujarat it is running on a similar campaign, promising free education and electricity. Another strong showing would establish the AAP as a national force, and perhaps the strongest challenger to the BJP ahead of India’s next general election in 2024.

## The soaring global cost of living

New York and Singapore are the world’s most expensive cities, according to the latest Worldwide Cost of Living Survey from EIU, <em>The Economist’s</em> sister company. The survey, which compares the prices of more than 200 products and services in 173 cities, finds that [living costs](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/09/08/global-living-standards-are-moving-in-the-wrong-direction) are rising at their fastest clip for at least 20 years. Prices in major cities are up by an average of 8.1%, in local-currency terms, over the past year.

Russia’s war in Ukraine is one cause, leading to higher food and energy prices. Supply-chain problems caused by covid-19 restrictions in China are another. Though six of the top ten cities that have moved the most up the rankings are in America, the two biggest climbers are Russian. Western sanctions have driven up prices such that St Petersburg has risen 70 places since 2021, while Moscow has shot up 88 slots, to 37th place.

## A Beckmann self-portrait goes under the hammer

Last year 80% of international art sales took place in America, Britain, China, Hong Kong or Taiwan. Germany, by contrast, does not have a reputation as an art-sales hotspot. But one lot on Thursday at Grisebach, one of the leading auction houses in Berlin, will command attention around the world.

Among the pieces going under the hammer is “Selbstbildnis gelb-rosa”—“Self-Portrait Yellow-Pink”—by Max Beckmann, a [German Expressionist](https://www.economist.com/1843/2019/03/14/talent-and-tragedy-). The painting is expected to go for between €20m-€30m ($21m-$31m), which would make it the priciest piece ever sold at auction in Germany.

Beckmann painted the self-portrait as a gift for his wife, Mathilde, in 1943, after the pair fled Nazi Germany (Beckmann had been declared a “cultural Bolshevik” by the regime). It has been privately owned until now. Painted in unusually bright colours, it offers a glimpse of the artist’s strong spirit in the face of war and exile.
