Officials at the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> agreed unanimously to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage points for the second month running in an attempt to [tamp down](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/07/21/should-central-banks-inflation-targets-be-raised) rampant <strong>inflation</strong>. The move lifts the Fed’s benchmark rate to between 2.25% and 2.5%. Central bankers are raising rates at the fastest pace since the 1980s. Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, said he does not believe America to be in a [recession](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/14/even-if-gdp-shrinks-america-may-officially-avoid-a-downturn-for-now) yet, but that the path to avoiding one has narrowed.

It was reported that <strong>Ukrainian troops</strong> destroyed a bridge that supplies <strong>Kherson</strong> in the south of their country, potentially [cutting off](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/03/ukraine-prepares-a-counter-offensive-to-retake-kherson-province) the Russian forces occupying it. Ukrainian officials said that Russia was trying to shift more troops there, from the east. Meanwhile, Russian forces appear to have captured Ukraine’s second-biggest power plant, at Vuhlehirsk, in the Donbas region. 

<strong>Joe Manchin</strong>, a conservative Democratic senator for West Virginia, said he had reached a deal with Chuck Schumer, the Senate’s top Democrat, on a <strong>spending bill</strong> that includes energy and tax provisions. Mr Manchin had previously torpedoed several iterations of President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better legislation, taking aim at [clean-energy incentives](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/21/american-climate-policy-is-in-tatters) in particular. “Build Back Better is dead,” Mr Manchin insisted in a statement, perversely, while championing the new agreement.

<strong>Meta</strong>, the [parent company](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/02/04/metamorphosis-facebook-and-big-tech-competition) of <strong>Facebook</strong>, reported its first-ever decline in quarterly revenues, which slipped by 1% year on year, to $28.8bn. Its user base held steady, but [TikTok](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/07/07/has-tiktok-burst-the-zuckerbubble), an up-and-coming rival, is nibbling away at its ad revenues. Meanwhile the Federal Trade Commission, America’s competition regulator, filed a complaint to stop Meta from taking over a virtual-reality firm.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

The coalition of right-wing parties predicted to win <strong>Italy’s</strong> election in September agreed that the party with the most votes among them would choose the next prime minister. According to <em>Politico</em>, that will probably be Brothers of Italy, a far-right party. Giorgia Meloni, its leader, would then replace Mario Draghi who [resigned last week](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/21/mario-draghi-italys-reformist-prime-minister-resigns) after losing a vote of confidence.

<strong>Electricité de France</strong>, one of the world’s largest utility companies, reported an unprecedented $1.34bn (€1.31bn) loss for the first half of 2022, amid [Europe’s energy crisis](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/14/europes-winter-of-discontent). The French government is preparing to buy the 16% of EDF it doesn’t already own and nationalise the company. Meanwhile <strong>Shell</strong>, an [oil supermajor](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/25/state-run-oil-giants-will-make-or-break-the-energy-transition), posted a record-breaking $11.5bn profit in the second quarter. 

<strong>North Korea’s</strong> leader, Kim Jong Un, declared that his country stands ready to deploy its [nuclear deterrent](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/04/07/north-korea-is-testing-icbms-again-nuclear-weapons-may-be-next). Mr Kim’s stern words were typically hyperbolic, but for the first time he rubbished [South Korea’s new president](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/05/07/south-koreas-incoming-president-faces-a-tough-tenure) by name. Officials in Yoon Suk-yeol’s government, as well as in Washington, have warned that the North seems to be planning its first nuclear test since 2017.

## America on the brink of recession

When America reports its latest GDP data on Thursday, all eyes will be on whether the economy contracted for a second straight quarter—the popular definition of a [recession](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/07/24/why-it-is-too-early-to-say-the-world-economy-is-in-recession). On balance, it may avoid that: despite shrinking in the first quarter of 2022, it is expected to have eked out an expansion in the second quarter.

Still, the White House has [pre-emptively argued](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/14/even-if-gdp-shrinks-america-may-officially-avoid-a-downturn-for-now) that a mild contraction would not equal a recession. It is technically correct. The official determination of whether America is in recession is made by the National Bureau for Economic Research, which places much weight on the jobs market. America’s current unemployment rate of 3.6%, one of the lowest levels in seventy years, is not consistent with any notion of a downturn. But what matters most for voters is their perception of growth. And that does not look good: consumer sentiment has plunged. Many believe the economy is in bad shape, regardless of the data.

## MBS in Paris

Fresh from his official visit to Greece, Muhammad bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince and de facto ruler, heads to Paris on Thursday. He will be treated to dinner at the Elysée Palace by the French president, Emmanuel Macron.

Prince Muhammad has been wooing Western leaders in an effort to cast off his reputation as an autocratic butcher and to promote tourism to Saudi Arabia. This is his first visit to Europe since the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist, in Turkey in 2018. The trip comes only two weeks after President Joe Biden ditched his previous pledge to treat the kingdom as a pariah state by [making his own visit](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/07/12/what-does-the-middle-east-offer-america) there. 

The crown prince’s outreach has been helped by Russia’s war in Ukraine. Europe is struggling with a squeeze on supplies of [Russian gas](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter), and needs alternatives. To this end, Mr Macron recently agreed a diesel deal with Muhammad bin Zayed, president of the United Arab Emirates. With Prince Muhammad in Paris, though, human-rights activists will be dismayed as realpolitik prevails.

## Ukraine celebrates its statehood

On Thursday Ukraine marks a national day of “statehood”, a holiday announced in happier times last summer by Volodymyr Zelensky, the president. When [Russia invaded](https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis) in February, the very idea of Ukrainian statehood seemed in doubt. But after Ukraine’s army saw off the Russians from Kyiv, that is no longer the case.

Indeed, there is reason for cautious optimism. Russian forces remain on the offensive in Donetsk, a province in eastern Ukraine, attacking along the Siversk-Bakhmut line, a north-south axis that protects the cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk. But they have made “virtually no progress over the past three weeks”, according to Rochan Consulting, a firm tracking the war. Ukraine has also stepped up its counter-attacks in [Kherson province](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/03/ukraine-prepares-a-counter-offensive-to-retake-kherson-province), in the south, blowing up bridges to cut off Russian forces west of the Dnieper river. It is unclear whether this marks the start of a long-awaited full Ukrainian counter-offensive in the province. But either way, it imposes an unpleasant dilemma on Russia: shore up the lines in Kherson, or keep feeding soldiers into the Donetsk meat-grinder?

## Mixed results for Big Tech

Tech stocks have [tumbled](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/05/14/tech-bubbles-are-bursting-all-over-the-place) over the past year. The Nasdaq 100 index has fallen by around 25% since January. Investors have therefore paid keen attention to the earnings reports of America’s five tech giants this week.

On Tuesday Alphabet, Google’s parent company, announced second-quarter revenue of $69.7bn, up 13% year-on-year. That was lower than expected, but investors did not mind: they had feared a meltdown in the online-ad industry after Snap and Twitter posted poor results last week. But those fears materialised on Wednesday when Meta, parent to Facebook and Instagram, reported its first-ever quarterly decline. Year-on-year revenue fell by 1% to $28.8bn. Its share price fell on the news.

Things look rosier in the cloud-computing and enterprise markets. Though Microsoft’s revenue, reported on Tuesday, fell short of expectations, bosses expect “double-digit” revenue growth this fiscal year. That bodes well for Amazon, the cloud market leader, which publishes earnings on Thursday. The outlook for Apple, which also reports on Thursday, is less bright: rising [inflation](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/19/peoples-inflation-expectations-are-rising-and-will-be-hard-to-bring-down) may temper demand for its expensive gadgets.

## The Commonwealth Games struggle for relevance

The Commonwealth Games, which begin in Birmingham on Thursday, are sometimes referred to as “the friendly games”. But congeniality counts for little in sport.

The competition is struggling for relevance, thanks to a host of other, more exciting rivals. (Athletics wrapped up its World Championships on July 24th.) The Commonwealth Games are also expensive. Britain’s government stepped in at a cost of £778m ($940m) after Durban, in South Africa, which was to have been the first African host, was stripped of its hosting duties in 2017 amid financial problems. And then there is the Commonwealth itself, a legacy of the British empire that some see as a colonial relic.

The games’ organisers promise a sweep of changes. The next competition, in 2026, will take place not in one city, but across the Australian state of Victoria. They may also allow hosts to propose new sports that have local relevance. Canada, for instance, which wants to host the centenary event in 2030, could add lacrosse. But if these efforts fail, the games risk becoming one of sport’s also-rans.
