Gas from both <strong>Nord Stream</strong> 1 and 2, pipelines connecting Russia and Germany, leaked into the Baltic Sea following an unexplained drop in pressure. Nord Stream 2, which is owned by Gazprom, a state-run Russian energy giant, is [defunct](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/02/22/the-west-imposes-swift-sanctions-on-russia-can-they-stop-a-war) but still filled with gas. Nord Stream 1 has also been inactive because Russia is withholding gas from Europe in response to economic sanctions. Denmark and Germany are investigating the cause of the leaks. Poland’s prime minister said he suspected sabotage.

<strong>Ukrainians</strong> who helped organise <strong>referendums</strong> in [four Russian-controlled areas](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/23/voting-begins-in-four-sham-referendums-in-ukraine) will face treason charges and years in jail, according to an adviser to Ukraine’s president. This does not include Ukrainians coerced into voting to join <strong>Russia</strong>. The polls will close on Tuesday. Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, is expected to announce the results (inevitably in his favour) on September 30th.

Global <strong>stock prices</strong> recovered some losses after a brutal selloff on Monday which saw the S&amp;P 500 close at its lowest this year. The [pound](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/26/the-pound-is-plumbing-near-historical-depths-why) also rebounded against the dollar, rising above the nadir of below $1.04 that it reached on Monday. But markets remain on edge amid mounting economic anxiety and the prospect of steeper interest-rate rises.

<strong>Dmitry Medvedev</strong>, a former president of Russia, said that the country has the right to use [nuclear](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/14/do-russias-military-setbacks-increase-the-risk-of-nuclear-conflict) <strong>weapons</strong> in the war in Ukraine. Mr Medvedev, an ally of Vladimir Putin, also stated his belief that NATO would stay out of the conflict for fear of “a nuclear apocalypse”. Meanwhile, heavy fighting was reported along the front separating Ukrainian and Russian troops. 

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

The World Bank slashed its growth forecast for <strong>China</strong> in 2022, in part because of the [country’s zero-covid policy](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/08/18/chinas-economy-is-beset-by-problems) and [property crisis](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/15/chinas-property-crisis-hasnt-gone-away-it-is-getting-worse). The bank expects the world’s second-biggest economy to grow at an annual rate of 2.8%, a little over half of its previous forecast of 5%. Growth in the East Asia and the Pacific regions was also revised down to 3.2%.

<strong>Kamala Harris</strong>, America’s vice-president, will visit the demilitarised zone separating the two <strong>Koreas</strong> on Thursday. The visit will highlight America’s “ironclad” commitment towards South Korea’s security, according to an American official. The announcement comes days after North Korea fired a ballistic missile off its east coast, the latest in a [series of tests](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/04/07/north-korea-is-testing-icbms-again-nuclear-weapons-may-be-next) this year.

NASA’s <strong>DART probe </strong>successfully smashed into an asteroid 6.8m miles away in a test of the American space agency’s [ability to defend Earth](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/an-exploration-of-earths-defences-will-launch-next-month/21805517) by deflecting incoming projectiles. It will be a few weeks before scientists know for sure if the experiment worked, but Lori Glaze, NASA’s planetary science director, called it a “new era of humankind”.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>970m, the number of people around the world affected by 12 mental-health conditions. The total could well be an underestimate. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/21/how-to-keep-the-brain-healthy).

<strong>Correction: </strong>In Thursday’s edition of <em>Espresso</em> we described how in 1917 the Bolsheviks toppled the Russian monarchy. In fact the Bolsheviks toppled the Provisional Government, which had replaced the monarchy after an earlier revolution the same year.

## Japan’s controversial state funeral

Last week world leaders gathered at Westminster Abbey to mourn the death of Queen Elizabeth II. On Tuesday many of them flocked to the other side of the world to attend the state funeral in Tokyo of [Abe Shinzo](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/09/26/the-fallout-from-abe-shinzos-murder-could-unseat-his-successor), a former Japanese prime minister, who was assassinated in July. 

Japan’s current prime minister, Kishida Fumio, hopes the event will boost the country’s presence on the global stage. But the plan has been hugely unpopular among Japanese thanks to Abe’s controversial [legacy](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/14/abe-shinzo-left-his-mark-on-asia-and-the-world-not-just-japan), which includes downplaying the nation’s wartime atrocities, and the cost, estimated at about ¥1.66bn ($11.8m). A poll in mid-September by <em>Nikkei</em>, a media giant, found that only 33% of the public favoured holding the funeral. It also revealed that the approval rating for Mr Kishida’s government had plunged from 57% in August to 43%. Protests are expected across the country.

Rumours abound that such opposition could push the government into holding a snap election this autumn. Conversely, once the funeral is over and the Japanese have witnessed global dignitaries paying tribute to Abe, that opposition might fade.

## Russia’s nuclear blackmail

Western officials have grown increasingly concerned about the risk that Russia, facing severe setbacks on the battlefield, might resort to the use of [nuclear weapons](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/14/do-russias-military-setbacks-increase-the-risk-of-nuclear-conflict) in Ukraine. Russia is annexing large parts of occupied Ukraine through sham referendums, perhaps as early as Tuesday. President Vladimir Putin has argued that Ukrainian attacks on these territories would thus constitute attacks on Russian soil, and has hinted at nuclear retaliation to protect the country’s “territorial integrity”. Dmitry Medvedev, a former president and key ally of Mr Putin, reiterated on Tuesday that Russia has the right to defend itself with nuclear weapons and this was certainly “not a bluff”. 

How seriously should these threats be taken? Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, has said that he doesn’t think Mr [Putin is](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/21/vladimir-putin-vows-to-send-more-invaders-the-west-should-arm-ukraine-faster) bluffing. Jake Sullivan, America’s national security adviser, has said that his government has warned Russia that nuclear use would have “catastrophic consequences”. American officials say that these could include conventional military strikes against Russia. But if Russia were to respond in kind, the result would be a shooting war between NATO and Russia—the very thing the two sides have sought to avoid ever since Mr Putin’s ill-fated invasion. 

## The reinvention of BlackBerry

BlackBerry, the Canadian manufacturer of a once-iconic messaging accessory used by business people with dextrous thumbs, has been in decline for more than a decade. Its reluctance to replace the devices’ fiddly buttons with touchscreens, and its failure to embrace apps, ceded the smartphone market to [Apple](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/31/apple-already-sold-everyone-an-iphone-now-what) and Android. The firm stopped making its handsets in 2020, and finally ceased support for them this year. Since then it has tried to reinvent itself as a maker of business software. 

In its quarterly results due on Tuesday, analysts hope for evidence of a successful turnaround. BlackBerry’s cybersecurity business, including antivirus software and secure mobile apps, is growing slowly but steadily. More promising is its booming [Internet of Things](https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2019/09/12/the-internet-of-things-will-bring-the-internets-business-model-into-the-rest-of-the-world) business; BlackBerry software is embedded in 215m vehicles and various other bits of machinery. Could it eventually turn a profit? One day, perhaps, but expect it to announce another loss-making quarter first.

## Britain’s economy takes a pounding

Investors are still reeling from Kwasi Kwarteng’s [fiscal statement](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically) last Friday, when the new British finance minister breezily announced the biggest tax cuts in half a century, along with measures that will increase borrowing by 3% of GDP this year. After weekend reports of yet more fiscal largesse to come, the [pound](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/26/the-pound-is-plumbing-near-historical-depths-why) dropped to a record low against the dollar in the early hours of Monday, before recovering some ground. 

On Tuesday the government will feel the consequences of its actions further, when it tries to borrow £1.2bn ($1.3bn) in inflation-linked gilts maturing in 2031. At 9am on September 23rd the market interest rate for unlinked gilts was 3.46%, but by close of play on Monday it had climbed to[ 4.1](https://markets.ft.com/data/bonds/tearsheet/charts?s=UK10YG)%. On Sunday Mr Kwarteng declined to comment on short-term market moves, claiming that he was focusing on growth. But unless something changes to bolster investors’ trust, the clamour to change course will be hard to ignore.

## “Silent Spring” and modern environmentalism

Sixty years ago on Tuesday, Rachel Carson’s book “Silent Spring” was published. Combining rigorous scientific analysis with lyrical prose, Carson, an aquatic biologist at America’s department of fisheries, detailed the extensive damage DDT and other such insecticides wreaked on [ecosystems](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/06/02/cicadas-insecticides-and-children). The chemical industry tried to sue, also attacking Carson’s scientific credentials (she did not have a PhD) and personal life. Undeterred, President John F. Kennedy ordered his scientific advisory committee to investigate. DDT was banned in America in 1972.

Influential figures from Al Gore, a former American vice-president, to Rex Weyler, a co-founder of Greenpeace International, credit Carson, who died in 1964, with inspiring their [environmental campaigning](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/04/16/in-chilly-parts-of-europe-heatwaves-strengthen-environmentalism). Sir David Attenborough, a British naturalist, describes “Silent Spring” as the book which, after “On the Origin of Species”, has most profoundly shaped the scientific world. Carson’s legacy further endures in environmental literature, influencing writers such as Robert Macfarlane. In Margaret Atwood’s novel “The Year of the Flood”, the feast day of Saint Rachel Carson is celebrated. Though not a saint, Carson was certainly a herald.
