Britain’s chancellor of the exchequer, <strong>Kwasi Kwarteng</strong>, has been sacked after rushing back to London from Washington amid speculation that the government will reverse more of the chaotic [mini-budget](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/27/the-fallout-from-kwasi-kwartengs-mini-budget-continues) he announced in September. He is the second shortest-serving chancellor on record. The prime minister, Liz Truss, is set to announce his successor later on Friday, together with more economic U-turns. The government has already abandoned plans to abolish the [top rate of income tax](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/10/03/kwasi-kwarteng-reverses-course-on-the-top-rate-of-tax). Now a proposal to scrap a planned increase in corporation tax could go the same way.

All nine members of the House committee [investigating the attack](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/21/the-january-6th-committee-has-hobbled-donald-trump) of <strong>January 6th 2021</strong> on America’s Capitol voted to subpoena<strong> Donald Trump</strong>. The former president is “required to answer for his actions”, said Bennie Thompson, the chairman. But Mr Trump will probably not comply. Separately, the Supreme Court denied Mr Trump’s request to secure access to classified documents seized from his estate in Florida.

The <strong>Russian-installed</strong> official in charge of <strong>Kherson</strong>, in southern <strong>Ukraine</strong>, told civilians to “save themselves” by evacuating to Russia amid a Ukrainian [counter-offensive](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/03/as-ukraine-smashes-through-more-russian-lines-russians-wonder-whom-to-blame). Ukraine claimed its army has recaptured 75 settlements in the strategic province. As Russia’s hold in the south slipped, it made gains in eastern Ukraine, the first such advance since early July, according to Britain’s intelligence agencies.

American <strong>stockmarkets</strong> rebounded from higher-than-expected <strong>inflation</strong> figures released on Thursday, with the S&amp;P 500 leaping by 2.6% and Asian and European markets keeping step on Friday morning. Last month America’s consumer price index rose by 0.4% compared with [August](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/13/america-still-has-an-inflation-problem). Investors are all but certain that the Federal Reserve will deliver yet another [jumbo rate increase](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/21/as-america-raises-rates-the-rest-of-the-world-bears-the-pain) next month.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

Amid rising tensions on the <strong>Korean peninsula</strong> the north fired a short-range ballistic missile off its east coast, the latest in a series of [such launches](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/09/22/kim-jong-un-considers-devolving-power-over-his-nuclear-arsenal). The country also buzzed the heavily militarised border with the south with fighter jets and fired 170 artillery rounds into the “sea buffer” zones off the coast. South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol denounced the “provocations”.

<strong>Netflix</strong> said its forthcoming ad-supported offering would cost $6.99 a month in America. The new tier will be available in 12 countries starting next month. Four to five minutes of ads will accompany each hour of programming. The streaming firm, which [lost subscribers](https://www.economist.com/business/netflix-sheds-subscribers-and-170bn-in-market-value/21808847) in the first half of the year, wants to attract customers on lower budgets.

A jury in Florida sentenced the culprit in the <strong>Parkland shooting</strong> of 2018 to life in prison without the chance of parole. Nikolas Cruz pled guilty last October to the premeditated murder of 14 students and three teachers in Florida. It was the [deadliest school shooting](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2019/02/13/a-year-after-the-massacre-of-14-high-school-students-what-has-changed) in America to go to trial. On the day of the sentencing an unrelated mass shooting in Raleigh, North Carolina took at least five lives.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 1,982 tonnes, an estimate for the record-breaking quantity of cocaine produced in 2020. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/12/joe-biden-is-too-timid-it-is-time-to-legalise-cocaine).

## Wall Street banks report

Banks are unusual companies. [Rising interest rates](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/29/global-rate-rises-are-happening-on-an-unprecedented-scale) and slowing growth are a double-whammy for other firms, driving up costs and hurting revenues. But higher rates are a boon for banks, who make money on the spread they can charge between the cost of borrowing funds and lending them out (called net interest income, or NII). This swells with higher interest rates. 

The question is whether high NII offsets sluggishness elsewhere in the business and rising costs. Eventually high rates and slow growth will cause loan losses to rise, which banks must account for by setting aside buffers. [Investment banking](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/28/investment-banks-are-sharpening-the-axe) activity—like mergers and acquisitions or IPOs—is still dormant. But trading activity was probably strong in still volatile markets. On Friday JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley report their third-quarter earnings. Analysts seem to think the good might outweigh the bad. JPM, for example, is expected to earn close to $3 a share, around 10-15% higher than in the first two quarters of the year.

## Georgia’s Senate candidates debate

A highly anticipated debate between the two candidates for a [Senate seat in Georgia](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/10/13/georgias-races-suggest-good-candidates-can-beat-partisan-reflexes) will take place on Friday. Raphael Warnock, the Democratic incumbent and a reverend, has long been keen to contrast his oratorical skills with Herschel Walker, a Republican former American footballer who is a singularly untalented communicator. Mr Walker, who tried for months to shirk the debate, is mired in several scandals. The latest, in which he reportedly paid for an ex-girlfriend’s abortion despite his avowedly pro-life stance, has rocked the campaign.  
  
 The race for governor of Georgia, though, looks good for the Republicans, with Brian Kemp leading [Stacey Abrams](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2022/10/10/a-conversation-with-stacey-abrams) in the polls. That the [Senate race favours Mr Warnock](https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-midterms-2022/forecast/senate/georgia) is a reflection of his abilities as a politician but also of his exceptionally weak opponent. Overall control of the Senate after the November 8th midterms may be decided by the good people of Georgia—and thus the poor nomination decisions of its state Republican Party.

## Haiti’s criminal chaos

The UN is considering whether to send troops to Haiti following a request last week by the government. Ariel Henry, the prime minister, has asked for a “specialised armed force” to help crack down on criminal gangs. America has sent a coastguard vessel to patrol Haitian waters, and promised more aid. But it has stopped short of committing manpower.  
  
 Never stable, since the assassination of [Jovenel Moïse](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2021/07/07/the-murder-of-haitis-president-will-worsen-the-countrys-chaos), the president, in July 2021, Haiti has descended into chaos. The gangs blockade fuel distribution and murder people with impunity. The new school term has been postponed. Hospitals lack supplies. Cholera has broken out. 

Yet Mr Henry’s request is controversial. The prime minister, [installed](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/02/05/foreign-aid-has-done-little-to-help-haiti) as acting president after Mr Moïse’s death, has little legitimacy and Haitians have taken to the streets calling for his resignation. And Haitians were bruised by the experience of 2004 to 2017, when soldiers participating in a UN peacekeeping mission [introduced cholera and sexually abused Haitian girls](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2012/04/28/first-do-no-harm). For all that, Haiti’s situation is so dire that such a record may have to be overlooked.

## Burkina Faso’s putschists make a plan

On September 30th [Burkina Faso](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/01/for-the-second-time-this-year-soldiers-stage-a-coup-in-burkina-faso) suffered its second coup this year. Captain Ibrahim Traoré declared he was forced to take action because the strongmen who [overthrew the elected government in January](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/01/29/a-coup-in-burkina-faso-will-help-the-sahels-jihadists) were failing to stop the region’s jihadists, loosely affiliated to al-Qaeda and Islamic State, from wreaking havoc. The earlier putschists had made the same claim of the regime they usurped. 

As their coup-mongering predecessors did, the soldiers have convened a conference with political parties and some NGOs, which begins on Friday. In theory, its participants will draw up a transitional charter and select a transitional president. In practice, the men with guns will decide who is in charge: perhaps Captain Traoré himself will simply carry on. 

The last putschists promised to hand back power to civilians by July 2024. Captain Traoré has suggested he will stick to that deadline. In any case, with the army divided and jihadists poised to take advantage, events could overtake even the best laid plans.

## A mountain race against climate change

A Himalayan race to raise awareness of climate change is under way in Bhutan. For five days until Monday, 29 elite runners will follow 206km (126 miles) of the “snowman track,” a path forged by yak herders. With an average elevation of 4,270 metres, the inaugural Snowman Race will be one of the hardest ultramarathons in the world.  
  
 Conditions in Bhutan are also challenging. On the plus side, it is one of the world’s only carbon-negative countries: its forests absorb three times as much carbon dioxide as the mountain kingdom emits. But rising temperatures are causing havoc. Himalayan glaciers are melting fast; two-thirds may be gone by 2100. That could have devastating consequences, of the sort suffered by Pakistan when melting glaciers recently contributed to [terrible floods](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/09/15/devastating-floods-like-pakistans-will-be-more-common-in-a-warming-world). Bhutan’s “dragon king”, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, is a keen conservationist. In backing the Snowman Race he hopes that others—including China and India, Bhutan’s giant, polluting neighbours—will be spurred into action.
