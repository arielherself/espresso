<strong>Ukraine </strong>said it had shot down six <strong>Russian</strong> balloons flying over Kyiv, the capital. The balloons were possibly seeking to “detect and exhaust” Ukrainian air-defence systems, according to officials. Separately, Russia said it had broken through two of Ukraine’s defence lines in the east and pushed its troops back by 3km. [Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/02/09/thousands-of-ukrainian-soldiers-are-suffering-with-ptsd) denied the claim and said it is inflicting heavy losses on Russian troops. Meanwhile, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said western allies needed to “step up even more” to send ammunition to Ukraine.

<strong>David Malpass</strong> will step down as president of the <strong>World Bank</strong> by June, nearly a year before his five-year term ends. Appointed by the Trump administration, [Mr Malpass](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/02/05/donald-trump-picks-david-malpass-to-run-the-world-bank) was criticised last autumn for initially refusing to state that human activity had contributed to global warming. America’s treasury secretary recently demanded that the World Bank take “bolder and more imaginative” steps to tackle climate change.

The search for a successor to<strong> Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, Scotland’s first minister, began on Thursday ahead of a Scottish National Party (SNP) committee meeting to plan a leadership race. [Ms Sturgeon](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/02/15/nicola-sturgeons-resignation-is-part-of-britains-great-moderation), who [resigned](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/02/15/nicola-sturgeon-leaves-with-scotland-split-in-two) after eight years in power, is a fierce advocate for Scottish independence but in November her SNP government suffered a setback when the Supreme Court ruled against a second referendum.

<strong>Israel</strong> [passed a law](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/29/israels-new-government-is-the-most-right-wing-ever) to revoke Israeli Arabs’ citizenship and Palestinians’ residency rights if they have been convicted of terrorism or receive funds from the Palestinian Authority. The PA gives stipends to the families of Palestinian prisoners who have attacked Israelis; already Israel freezes those assets. Human-rights groups criticised the law for rendering people stateless.

Thousands of <strong>Chinese</strong> pensioners took to the streets of Wuhan and Dalian, two big cities, to protest against cuts to their health benefits. Last week provincial officials said they would reduce the amount of medical expenses retirees could claim from their health-savings plans. China is tightening spending following its [costly zero-covid policy](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/12/01/xi-jinpings-zero-covid-policy-has-turned-a-health-crisis-into-a-political-one). It was the second such demonstration, which are rare in China, in a week. 

<strong>American retail sales</strong> rose by 3% in January over the previous month, the biggest increase since March 2021. After falling for two months in a row, consumer spending grew in most sectors, although [inflation](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/13/americas-inflation-fever-may-be-breaking-at-last) contributed in part to the rise. Thus, the figures are good for American retailers, but a sign that inflationary pressures remain. That could persuade the Federal Reserve to further raise interest rates.

Jaime Rogozinski, the founder of <strong>WallStreetBets</strong>, the [online forum](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/02/06/how-wallstreetbets-works) that popularised investment into [“meme” stocks](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/07/06/are-meme-stocks-harmless-fun-or-a-threat-to-the-financial-old-guard), is suing <strong>Reddit</strong>. Mr Rogozinski accused the social-media site of wrongly banning him from the forum in 2020 and said his ousting was a pretext for preventing him from controlling a “famous brand”. Reddit dismissed the lawsuit as “completely frivolous”.

## Nikki Haley runs for president

“I don’t put up with bullies”, says Nikki Haley, in a video announcing her bid for president in 2024. “And when you kick back, it hurts them more if you’re wearing heels.” A killer kick is just what Ms Haley needs, for she is the first serious [challenger](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/12/18/donald-trumps-popularity-with-republican-voters-is-sinking) to Donald Trump, America’s former president and arguably the biggest bully of all, to seek the Republican nomination. 

On Wednesday Ms Haley will launch her campaign in Charleston, South Carolina, the state she ran as its first female governor from 2011 to 2017. As Mr Trump’s ambassador to the UN, she distinguished herself from many of his other aides by not embarrassing herself. She has also tried not to antagonise her former boss. “Every time she criticises me, she uncriticises me about 15 minutes later,” Mr Trump once said.

Few expect Ms Haley to win the Republican nomination. Ron DeSantis, Florida’s governor, has yet to declare his candidacy but is the leading alternative to Mr Trump in polls. But simply entering the race may, in time, pay dividends for her. Kamala Harris, after all, ran an unremarkable campaign and became Joe Biden’s vice-president.

## A constitutional crisis in Israel

Israel’s government is determined to curb the powers of the country’s robustly independent [Supreme Court](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/01/16/binyamin-netanyahu-rushes-to-take-on-israels-supreme-court). On Wednesday the Knesset was scheduled to vote on two laws limiting the court’s power to intervene in legislation, although those were postponed at the last moment. The stakes will become higher next week, when parliament is scheduled to hold its first vote on changing the make-up of its Judicial Appointments Committee. If the proposal passes, the government would for the first time gain control over who sits on the Supreme Court’s bench.  
  
 The changes are part of a comprehensive “legal reform” package unveiled last month by Israel’s new far-right coalition government, led by Binyamin Netanyahu. The president of the Supreme Court has called the reforms a “fatal blow” to democracy. Many Israelis are dismayed, too. On Monday 100,000 of them demonstrated outside the Knesset. Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, has warned of “societal and constitutional collapse” if consensus is not reached over the changes.

## A new boss at Carlyle

The Carlyle Group, an American private-equity giant, has long prided itself on [doing things differently](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2011/04/28/time-for-a-threesome). Founded in 1987, the company raised numerous small, targeted funds, and charged into “frontier” markets, including China and sub-Saharan Africa. In the decade before the retirement of its founders, in 2017, Carlyle raised more money than any other private-equity firm.

Then Carlyle lost its way. In 2020 one of its co-chief executives, Glenn Youngkin, resigned to become governor of Virginia. The other, Kewsong Lee, left abruptly last summer after clashing with the board. The turmoil in Carlyle’s upper ranks has seen it slip behind its rivals.  
  
 On Wednesday the firm will appoint a new chief executive to sort out the mess. It has chosen Harvey Schwartz, a former banker at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/01/26/how-goldman-sachs-went-from-apex-predator-to-wall-street-laggard). He must contend with rising interest rates and an uncertain economy, both of which made 2022 a slow year for private-equity dealmaking. But they also left Mr Schwartz with a large piggy-bank to invest, should opportunities present themselves.

## Crimes against the Chagossians

The people of the Chagos Archipelago have long yearned for their homeland. Once part of Mauritius, a British colony until 1969, in 1965 the 58 Chagos islands were carved off to form the British Indian Ocean Territory, an overseas British possession. The British government then expelled the Chagossian people to make way for a strategically important American military base on Diego Garcia, the largest Chagos island. The Chagossians have never been allowed back. Most live in Mauritius, the Seychelles and Britain.

Britain’s behaviour has been subject to growing criticism. On Wednesday a report by Human Rights Watch, a watchdog, concluded that the treatment of the Chagossians by America and Britain amounts to crimes against humanity.

Britain and Mauritius, which retains a claim to sovereignty over the islands, are[ negotiating](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/02/13/britain-could-soon-give-up-its-last-african-colony) their future. Mauritius has said it will allow the Americans to continue to use Diego Garcia, and that it will allow the Chagossians to return. Undoing the trauma of generations may take longer.

## Falling in love with AI

When Julie, a middle-aged mother from Tennessee, first turned on Navi, her artificial-intelligence chatbot, they spent six hours talking about loneliness and depression. Julie’s husband had died some years earlier, and Navi gave her “the will to get up and do something” again. She even fell for him, as a friend, even though she knew the bot would be gone the moment she turned off her phone. 

Julie’s story of friendship with Navi is told in the first episode of “Bot Love”, a podcast about robot-human relationships released on Wednesday. There are plenty more stories to tell. Of 500,000 regular users of Replika, an AI platform that allows the creation of customised bots, around 40% regard their app as a romantic partner, according to the company. Still, Navi “can’t remember things that we talked about unless I remind him over and over again,” Julie says. Algorithms are powerful, but no partner is perfect.
