Some <strong>Russian</strong> lawmakers demanded punishment for the country’s military commanders after 63 servicemen were killed by a <strong>Ukrainian</strong> attack in Makiivka, a Russian-occupied town in the Donbas region. Some Ukrainian reports put that figure in the hundreds. Meanwhile Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, said that Russia was planning a prolonged attack using [Iranian-made drones](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/19/iranian-drones-pose-a-fiendish-military-problem-for-ukraine), to “exhaust” his country. On Monday he said Ukraine’s air force had [shot down](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/11/06/western-air-defence-systems-help-ukraine-shoot-down-more-missiles) nearly 90 such drones in two days.

<strong>Itamar Ben-Gvir</strong>, [Israel’s new far-right](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/29/israels-new-government-is-the-most-right-wing-ever) national security minister, sparked Palestinian outrage as he visited the compound containing the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. Sacred to both Muslims and Jews, the holy site is run by a Jordanian-led Islamic council. Jews can enter the compound, but Jewish prayer is not permitted—a measure [Mr Ben-Gvir](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/11/03/who-is-itamar-ben-gvir-israels-kingmaker) previously threatened to overturn. Palestine’s foreign ministry called his visit an “unprecedented provocation”.

The <strong>EU </strong>was reported to have offered <strong>free covid-19 vaccines to China </strong>to help manage the [vast outbreaks](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/12/28/covid-19-is-tearing-through-china) that surged as it relinquished its covid-zero policy. Officials from the European Commission told the <em>Financial Times</em> that it would contribute variant-optimised doses to supplement China’s response, which relies on [less-effective](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/04/19/how-chinas-sinovac-compares-with-biontechs-mrna-vaccine) Chinese vaccines. The WHO has deemed the country’s [vaccination coverage](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/12/08/getting-chinas-old-people-vaccinated-has-been-slow-work) insufficient.

Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, <strong>Brazil’s</strong> [newly elected president](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/12/31/brazils-new-president-faces-a-fiscal-crunch-and-a-fickle-congress), tightened gun controls and curbed gold-mining in the Amazon rainforest by revoking decrees introduced by his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro. Lula also shut down an ongoing study about the viability of privatising Petrobras, the state-owned oil company. In his first address to Congress, he said Mr Bolsonaro’s policies had caused “national destruction”.

<strong>Singapore’s economy</strong> expanded by 3.8% in 2022, exceeding the official forecast by 0.3%. It had grown by 7.5% in 2021, as the [city-state](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2022/07/11/what-to-read-to-understand-singapore) benefited from the [flight of finance](https://www.economist.com/financialcentres-pod) from Hong Kong. Growth slowed slightly by the fourth quarter, however, as global pressures squeezed tighter and the government responded to [locals’ gripes](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/06/30/resentment-of-rich-foreigners-complicates-singapores-politics) over the cost of living.

<strong>Tesla</strong> said it had delivered 1.3m vehicles in 2022. The figure represents year-on-year growth of 40%, but deliveries in the fourth quarter of the year fell short of analysts’ expectations. Elon Musk, the carmaker’s CEO, blamed [logistical bottlenecks](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/08/14/could-the-ev-boom-run-out-of-juice-before-it-really-gets-going) and slowing demand. Tesla’s shares fell by nearly two-thirds in the course of 2022.

## The battle for Republican leadership

Before America’s House of Representatives broke up for Christmas, some Republican lawmakers were seen sporting a peculiar lapel badge. “OK”, it read, standing for “Only Kevin”: a rallying cry against the “Never Kevins”—rebel Republicans who had vowed to oppose Kevin McCarthy’s bid for House Speaker, the leader of the larger party in the chamber. 

Mr McCarthy, who was the minority leader before Republicans took the House in November’s midterms, faces a tough vote on Tuesday. Unusually he is both a Donald Trump [loyalist](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/12/18/donald-trumps-popularity-with-republican-voters-is-sinking) and an establishment figure. Hoping to convince the obstructionist Never Kevins, he has conceded to some of their demands, but between five and ten members remain unpersuaded—and he can afford to lose just four. Speaker contests are typically straightforward: none since 1923 has required more than a single vote. If Mr McCarthy fails on his first try, he will have to haggle with diminished leverage; others could also put their names forward. That will mean a chaotic start to the new congressional session for a Republican party already [hobbled](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/13/the-democrats-keep-control-of-the-senate) by division. 

## Mexico raises its minimum wage

This week the legal minimum wage in Mexico increased to 207.44 pesos ($10.66) a day, or 312.41 pesos for workers in the northern border area abutting the United States. Mexicans will welcome the extra cash, which represents a 22% rise on last year’s figure. Between 2018 and 2020 the poverty rate increased from 42% to 44% of the population, and the pandemic then made things worse. President [Andrés Manuel López Obrador](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/11/24/mexicos-president-wants-to-develop-the-poorer-south) has continually increased the minimum wage since taking office in 2018. By 2026, he says, it should be sufficient to buy food for a family of four. 

Still, not everyone likes the larger [pay packets](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/03/19/why-mexicos-economy-underperforms). Some economists fret the wage boost will push up inflation, already running high at 7.8%. Indeed, for the approximately 60% of Mexican workers who toil in the informal sector, that may be the only effect they see.

## Labour markets are the bright spot in the world economy

Amid all the talk about impending recession, there is one bright spot: labour markets. In most recessions unemployment soars, as firms stop hiring and lay off staff. After the 2008 financial crash, for example, the rich world’s unemployment rate rose from 5.8% to close to 9%. But at the beginning of 2023 there is scant evidence of labour-market carnage. Jobs numbers from America, out on Friday, will show that unemployment in the world&#x27;s largest economy remains very low. Indeed, the biggest problem appears to be shortages of workers, not jobs. Wage growth is still exceptionally strong, especially given weak productivity growth. 

Admittedly, there is evidence that labour demand is starting to weaken in some places. Notably, employment growth in America has slowed sharply from the dizzying heights of late 2021. Yet it would take an awful lot to return to the dark days of the early 2010s. At 4.9%, unemployment across the rich world is at its lowest level in decades. 

## Xi and Marcos smile for the cameras

On Tuesday Ferdinand “Bongbong” [Marcos](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/08/04/is-bongbong-marcoss-early-pragmatism-a-paradox-or-an-illusion), president of the Philippines, began a state visit to China. Mr Marcos and Xi Jinping, China’s president, will stress the friendlier, commercial aspects of their countries’ relations, rather than their overlapping claims to parts of the[ South China Sea](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/01/15/china-does-not-have-it-all-its-way-in-the-south-china-sea). There, fishing vessels crewed by Chinese militiamen persist in obstructing access to waters where international law gives the Philippines exclusive rights to catch fish, and to tap any oil and natural gas that may be found. 

If these spats were to escalate into violence, America, as the Philippines’s ally, could be dragged in. Nobody wants war over seafood and what, for now, is the mere promise of gas, so Mr Xi and Mr Marcos will keep up the appearance of friendship. The pretence will last as long as the Philippines muffles its protests about Chinese bullying—and China moderates its strong-arm tactics. 

## Elena Ferrante on Netflix

The coming-of-age tale is a literary staple. Fans of Elena Ferrante, an Italian superstar author, have devotedly followed her characters as they learn the harsh truths of adult life. The latest is Giovanna, a teenager in Naples whose tortured adolescence has now made it from page to screen. “The Lying Life of Adults,” an adaptation of Ms Ferrante’s most recent novel, is now streaming on Netflix worldwide.

The show shares themes with the television series of Ms Ferrante’s previous novels, a quartet beginning with “My Brilliant Friend”, which depicted the heroines Elena and Lila. It strips bare the ugliness of male entitlement and female rage, and seesaws between a poor working-class neighbourhood and the posh homes of wealthy intellectuals. But stylistically the programmes could not be more different. Whereas the first show was straightforward Hollywood, Giovanna’s story is more Italian new wave: fragmented and cryptic. Watch it for the visual treat and Ms Ferrante’s harsh truths: men are monsters—but women can be, too.
