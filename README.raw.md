[Rishi Sunak](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/01/23/rishi-sunaks-hapless-government), <strong>Britain’s</strong> prime minister, sacked <strong>Nadhim Zahawi</strong>, the chairman of the governing Conservative Party, for “a serious breach of the ministerial code”. Mr Zahawi, briefly chancellor of the exchequer last year, had admitted reaching a settlement with the authorities over previously unpaid tax—reportedly amounting to about £5m ($6.2m), including a penalty. He had described the error as “careless and not deliberate”.

<strong>Binyamin Netanyahu</strong>, Israel’s [prime minister](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/01/16/binyamin-netanyahu-rushes-to-take-on-israels-supreme-court), promised to “take steps to strengthen settlement” and “exact a price from terrorists” after seven people were shot dead near a synagogue in <strong>Jerusalem </strong>on Friday. Several lethal incidents have occurred in the past few days. On Thursday Israeli troops killed nine Palestinians during a raid on Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank. And on Saturday a 13-year-old Palestinian boy shot and wounded two Israelis.

The <strong>Memphis Police Department</strong> disbanded its Scorpion unit after five of its officers were tied to the death of <strong>Tyre Nichols</strong>, an unarmed black man. The unit was a specialised group tasked with patrolling crime hotspots. Video footage showed Mr Nichols being beaten during a traffic stop on January 7th. He died three days later. The officers involved have been sacked and charged with second-degree murder.

Russian missile strikes killed three people and wounded at least two in <strong>Kostiantynivka</strong>, a small city in eastern <strong>Ukraine</strong>, according to local officials. Separately, reports emerged of fierce fighting in the town of Vuhledar, also in the <strong>Donetsk</strong> region. On Friday [Ukraine’s](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/01/25/nato-members-are-right-to-send-tanks-to-ukraine) president, Volodymyr Zelensky, described the situation at the front as “extremely acute”, especially in Donetsk.

Japan and the Netherlands reached a deal with <strong>America </strong>to limit exports of [chipmaking](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/01/23/chipmaking-is-being-redesigned-effects-will-be-far-reaching) tools to <strong>China </strong>as the White House seeks to restrict China’s ability to develop advanced <strong>semiconductors</strong> and [bolster](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/29/america-takes-on-china-with-a-giant-microchips-bill) its own chip industry. Dutch and Japanese support is essential: ASML, Nikon and Tokyo Electron are leading manufacturers of chipmaking kit.

<strong>China </strong>will again issue visas to <strong>Japanese</strong> citizens wanting to visit the country. In January, as China reopened its borders, [South Korea](https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/01/12/south-koreas-travel-spat-with-china) and Japan imposed restrictions on visitors coming from the country for fear of a covid-19 outbreak. China responded by refusing to issue visas to citizens of either country. On January 27th South Korea extended its restrictions until the end of February.

<strong>Petr Pavel</strong>, a retired general, won the second round of the <strong>Czech Republic’s</strong> presidential election, beating Andrej Babis, an oligarch and former prime minister. With nearly all ballots counted, Mr Pavel had more than 58% of the vote. The country’s [presidency](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/01/17/the-next-czech-president-will-be-a-trumpish-oligarch-or-a-general) is a largely ceremonial position, but Mr Pavel has been a strong supporter of NATO and providing aid for Ukraine. 

<strong>Word of the week: </strong><em>Blat</em>, Russian for an “economy of favours”, meaning one based on contacts, cunning and petty bribery. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/britain/2023/01/26/blat-the-soviet-art-of-getting-by-comes-to-britain).

## Tunisian voters get another chance to shrug

What if you call an election and no one comes? Tunisia holds a parliamentary run-off on Sunday. The [first round](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/20/a-farcical-election-pushes-tunisia-towards-one-man-rule), in December, was desultory: turnout was just 11%, far below the 43% of voters who showed up in 2019. Tunisians were unenthusiastic about their choices. Major parties decided to boycott the poll, leaving some districts with only one candidate or none at all. Just 21 candidates secured a majority (the parliament has 161 seats).

Kais Saied, the authoritarian-minded president, shrugs off criticism of the vote. Since July 2021, when he suspended parliament, he has moved Tunisia towards one-man rule, sacking judges and arresting critics. He rammed through a [new constitution](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/tunisia-is-setting-itself-up-for-an-autocratic-future) last summer that weakened the legislature. Meanwhile the economy is sinking. Inflation is forecast to average 11% this year. There are shortages of basic goods, from milk to medicine. Mr Saied has no good ideas for fixing this—and his pliant new parliament is unlikely to be much help.

## Weekend Profile: Olga Tsukanova, Russian anti-mobilisation activist

Last weekend Olga Tsukanova was heading to Moscow from her home in Samara, near the border with Kazakhstan, to deliver 700 letters written by disgruntled mothers of Russian soldiers to the prosecutor’s office. But at an airport in Samara she was detained, not for the first time, and warned she may be charged with “discrediting the army”. Ms Tsukanova has become the face of protests against Vladimir Putin’s mobilisation of Russian troops, though she is also uncomfortably close to peddlers of conspiracies about the war. 

Ms Tsukanova is a 46-year-old mother who says her son, who joined the army in July, faced pressure to deploy to Ukraine despite earlier assurances that he would not have to. (An official says her son is serving inside Russia.) 

After Mr Putin announced a “[partial mobilisation](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/21/vladimir-putin-declares-a-partial-mobilisation)” of recruits in September, Ms Tsukanova formed the Council of Mothers and Wives, which campaigns for better conditions for troops. Russian authorities have tolerated some criticism of the army’s incompetence in Ukraine. But there is little room for dissent in Mr Putin’s Russia: the government [stifled](https://www.economist.com/1843/2021/05/02/ive-mortally-offended-putin-by-surviving-why-alexei-navalny-keeps-fighting) opposition even before the invasion last February. Ms Tsukanova’s organisation has become a vehicle for broader [anger over the military mobilisation](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/09/29/protests-erupt-across-russia)—a stance that avoids a blatant anti-war message, but puts authorities in an awkward position. 

To shut down the group would look bad, and Mr Putin clearly recognises the symbolic power of a soldier’s mother. In November he convened a televised meeting of women the Kremlin said were mothers of troops serving in Ukraine (all were sympathetic to the government). Ms Tsukanova rebuked Mr Putin for excluding her. The next month she was stopped by police. “They are afraid of us,” she declared.

This is not Ms Tsukanova’s first foray into politics. She once stood as a candidate for Volya, a party that was later banned. Its leader, Svetlana Lada-Rus, is a spiritual healer and noted conspiracy theorist who once ran for president of Russia. Now Ms Tsukanova’s activism is complicated by her ties to another organisation affiliated with Ms Lada-Rus. The National Union of the Revival of Russia calls for the restoration of the Soviet Union and peddles anti-Semitic lies about the war’s origins. Ms Tsukanova’s council distributes that group’s conspiracy theories about covid-19 vaccines.

To confront Mr Putin’s regime, you must be either courageous or crazy. Ms Tsukanova may be both.

## Wayne Thiebaud’s candy art

Wayne Thiebaud, who as a teenager in the 1930s worked as an apprentice at Walt Disney Studios, painted sweet, cheery, ordinary things. The American’s subjects ranged from ice-cream cones to hot dogs, lipsticks, crayons and sardines in a tin. Candy-coloured and luminous, his canvases made [everyday objects into marvels](https://www.economist.com/1843/2020/01/15/how-andy-warhol-invented-american-art). On Sunday the first solo exhibition of his work in the German-speaking world opens at the Fondation Beyeler in Switzerland.

In 2020, the year before he died (aged 101), his work began to fetch steep prices. A painting from 1962 of four pinball machines sold for $19.1m, a record for the artist. In the following year “Towelling off” (1968), his portrait of a tennis player, went for almost $8.5m, roughly five times its expected price. Sweet indeed.

## Hockey looks for global relevance

[Hockey](https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/01/27/hockeys-potential-relies-on-india-its-fallen-superpower) (field hockey, if you’re North American) has much in common with football: each team has 11 players fighting to propel a ball into the other side’s goal. But in popularity, there is no comparison. Around 30m people pick up a stick regularly; hundreds of millions play football. Few will know their national teams, even in Belgium and Germany, whose representatives contest the men’s hockey World Cup final on Sunday.

One route for hockey to amass more popularity and cash runs through India. For years before and after independence, hockey was the country’s most popular sport, and India was the game’s superpower. But since then it has fallen behind in the rankings; a successful national team could reignite interest. That may be a while yet. At this World Cup, it couldn’t even make the quarter-finals. But it is slowly improving: at the last Olympics India snatched a bronze medal.

## Pakistan’s light in the tunnel

Pakistan’s ailing economy may get a new lease of life this week. On Tuesday a delegation from the International Monetary Fund arrives in Islamabad, the capital, for talks on resuming a bail-out programme suspended last year. This follows an announcement by Pakistan’s central bank that it would stop depleting its foreign-exchange reserves—now down to around $3.7bn, barely enough for three weeks’ [imports](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/06/21/why-is-pakistans-government-asking-people-to-drink-less-tea)—to prop up the rupee. 

Pakistan badly needs the IMF’s help. It has been [teetering on the brink](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/28/pakistan-may-be-able-to-avoid-a-full-blown-economic-crisis) of default for months. Annual inflation rose to 24.5% in December. Businesses complain about goods piling up at the port in Karachi, with importers unable to get hold of enough dollars to pay for them. On January 23rd a collapse of the power grid plunged the entire country into darkness. [Political turmoil](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/06/02/imran-khan-is-jeopardising-pakistans-attempts-to-fix-its-economy) has stymied efforts to tackle the crisis. The coming days will show if things can still be turned around.
