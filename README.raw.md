<strong>Volodymyr Zelensky</strong>, [Ukraine’s](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/12/20/our-country-of-the-year-for-2022-can-only-be-ukraine) president, met with <strong>Joe Biden</strong> in the White House and received a standing ovation [before Congress](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/12/21/volodymyr-zelensky-brings-his-message-to-washington) after saying that America’s aid is “not charity” but “an investment”. It was the first time Mr Zelensky left Ukraine since Russia invaded in February. Mr Biden pledged to keep supporting the war effort, particularly its [anti-missile and -drone](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/11/06/western-air-defence-systems-help-ukraine-shoot-down-more-missiles) capabilities—which are soon to benefit from America’s flagship Patriot air-defence system—and announced a further $1.85bn in aid.

<strong>Sam Bankman-Fried</strong>, the founder of <strong>FTX</strong>, a failed cryptocurrency exchange, was extradited from the Bahamas to New York, where he is to stand trial. Meanwhile two of his closest associates pleaded guilty to charges of fraud. America’s federal government has charged Mr Bankman-Fried with eight crimes, including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money-laundering and commodities-and-securities fraud.

A hospital in <strong>Shanghai</strong> reportedly told staff that it expects half of the city’s 25m people to become infected with <strong>covid-19</strong> by the end of December. The [virus has been sweeping](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/12/15/what-china-can-still-do-to-avoid-an-enormous-covid-death-toll) through <strong>China</strong> since the government moved away from its “zero-covid” policy following widespread protests. Local authorities have reported only 390,000 cases or so, a figure many think is an underestimate.

<strong>Britain </strong>had the worst-performing <strong>economy</strong> of any G7 country in the third quarter, according to the Office for National Statistics. Its economic output fell by 0.3% between July and September, 0.8% lower than the same period in 2019 (before the pandemic). Business investment fell by 2.5%. Most economists polled by Reuters predicted that the [economy would contract further](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/11/24/britains-economic-outlook-is-very-gloomy).

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Fiji’s </strong>police announced that the army would be helping them establish “security and stability” as a new government took the reins from <strong>Frank </strong><strong>Bainimarama</strong>, who ruled the Pacific-island state for the past 16 years. His successor, Sitiveni Rabuka, assembled a winning coalition after elections last week delivered a hung parliament. Fiji is no stranger to military coups; in the past, [both Messrs Bainimarama and Rabuka](https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/11/17/fijis-coup-makers-act-democratic) have staged them.

<strong>Micron Technology</strong>, an American memory-chip maker, announced that it would cut its staff by 10% in the new year, as a new earnings report disappointed analysts. The microchip business is becoming a frequent [victim of whiplash](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/10/after-a-turbocharged-boom-are-chipmakers-in-for-a-supersize-bust). Capital investment [surged in 2020](https://www.economist.com/business/2020/01/09/a-revival-is-under-way-in-the-chip-business), pushed along by pandemic-era shortages, only to collapse in 2022, under pressure from inflation, interest rates and lockdowns in China.

<strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> narrowly made the deadline to form a new government in <strong>Israel</strong>. His six-party coalition will be made up of far-right and ultra-Orthodox partners. It will be the most [right-wing administration](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/11/10/the-changing-nature-of-israeli-politics) in the country’s history. Once ratified by Israel’s parliament, the new deal will return Mr Netanyahu to power, after he was ousted last year.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 10%, the estimated reduction in income for being obese, according to research from America, Britain, Canada and Denmark. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2022/12/20/the-economics-of-thinness).

## 2022 in review: The worldwide cost-of-living crisis

<em>This week we are looking back on 2022. Today, finance and economics</em>

In 2021, following government splurges in response to the pandemic, many economists believed temporary inflation was inescapable. Few expected what unfolded. In 2022 inflation rates in many countries soared into double digits. Global inflation for 2022 is expected to be 8.8%, according to the IMF. In poor countries, the UN estimates that rising prices may have pushed 71m people into poverty. Those in rich countries, such as [Britain](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/08/the-cost-of-living-crisis-in-britain-is-not-just-about-energy), also felt the squeeze.

Big central banks, led by America’s [Federal Reserve](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/04/23/why-the-federal-reserve-has-made-a-historic-mistake-on-inflation), were forced into action, implementing the fastest and biggest interest-rate increases since the 1980s. In recent weeks inflation has decelerated, primarily because energy prices have fallen and supply chains are operating more smoothly. That will reduce the pace of central banks’ interest-rate rises, but they will [still have to be vigilant](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/07/inflation-is-falling-but-not-enough). Tight labour markets, loose fiscal policy and turbulent energy markets will continue to push prices higher.

## 2022 in review: A new normal for investors

After the global financial crisis of 2007-09, as interest rates fell and stayed low, asset prices surged and a “bull market in everything” took hold. In 2022 rising interest rates and runaway inflation put a painful end to that. At its lowest point of the year, the S&amp;P 500 index of leading American shares had lost more than $10trn in market value. Government bonds, usually a shelter from stocks, have also been hit. Meanwhile, [house prices are falling](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/10/20/a-global-house-price-slump-is-coming) everywhere from Vancouver to Sydney.

This year’s capital losses, however, have a silver lining. If the downside of higher asset prices was lower expected returns then, by symmetry, future real returns have now gone up. Investors need to change their [approach to markets](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/12/08/investing-in-an-era-of-higher-interest-rates-and-scarcer-capital). The new regime of higher interest rates and scarcer capital may seem like a shock, but for much of history these were the normal conditions for investors. It was the era of cheap money that was weird.

## 2022 in review: The unlikely economic winners

It has been a rough year for almost everyone. Inflation has been rampant; markets have been in turmoil. Yet this poor aggregate performance hides wide differences: some countries have done pretty well. <em>The Economist</em> has [ranked 34 mostly rich countries](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/18/2022s-unlikely-economic-winners) on five economic and financial indicators, including GDP, inflation and stockmarket performance. The ranking finds especially bright spots in the Mediterranean.

Top of our list is Greece. Other countries that plumbed the economic depths in the early 2010s, such as Portugal and Spain, also score highly, thanks to the lifting of covid lockdowns and a recovery in tourism. Two Baltic countries, Estonia and Latvia, which won plaudits in the 2010s for speedy reforms but rely on Russia for energy, come bottom.

Still, the gap between 2022’s winners and losers may not persist in 2023. Before long, growth in southern Europe, weighed down by rapidly ageing populations and high debts, will surely fall back to less stellar levels.

## 2022 in review: The collapse of crypto

It has been a terrible year for cryptocurrencies. In May Terra-Luna, a [decentralised stablecoin system](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/12/16/what-are-stablecoins-such-as-tether), worth around $40bn at its peak, collapsed, taking some $200bn off the market capitalisation of crypto with it. That led to the demise of other lending platforms and a hedge fund, wiping out another $200bn. Then came the biggest shock. In November FTX, the third-largest crypto trading platform at the time, filed for [bankruptcy](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/09/the-spectacular-fall-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried). The exchange is accused of lending customer funds to Alameda, a trading firm also owned by the once-feted [Sam Bankman-Fried](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/07/05/cryptos-last-man-standing) which allegedly then used the funds to make risky bets. The revelations sparked contagion and other big crypto firms collapsed.

As with previous crypto winters, there were existential questions about the [utility of crypto](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/11/17/is-this-the-end-of-crypto). Many speculated that FTX’s implosion could kill the entire market. That may be far-fetched. As bad a year as they have had, cryptocurrencies&#x27; market capitalisation is currently around $900bn, still 50% more than the value five years ago.
