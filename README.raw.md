<strong>Russia’s</strong> ruling party proposed holding <strong>referendums</strong> on the status of occupied Ukrainian territories on November 4th, according to <em>AFP</em>. A [vote](https://www.economist.com/europe/2014/03/15/a-predictable-outcome) in occupied Crimea in 2014 was used by Russia to justify the annexation of the peninsula. Meanwhile the commander of Ukraine’s armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, confirmed that a string of recent explosions in Russia-occupied <strong>Crimea </strong>were conducted by Ukrainian forces, the country’s first official admission of its role in the attacks.

The <strong>Biden administration </strong>announced that <strong>tech firms</strong> which receive federal funding under its new [CHIPS Act](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/29/america-takes-on-china-with-a-giant-microchips-bill) will not be allowed to build any “advanced technology” facilities, or factories, in China for ten years. The move was justified on [national security](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/07/07/britain-and-america-sound-a-joint-alarm-over-china) grounds, amidst fears of [China](https://www.economist.com/international/2022/01/29/will-china-dominate-the-world-of-semiconductors) stealing such technology. America also wants to rebuild its own share of the global [semiconductor](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/10/after-a-turbocharged-boom-are-chipmakers-in-for-a-supersize-bust) market, now just 10%, down from nearly 40% in 1990.

<strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong>, president of the European Commission, admitted that Europeans faced “tough times” because of [sky-high energy prices](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/05/europe-scrambles-to-protect-citizens-from-sky-high-energy-prices) caused by Russia’s manipulation of [natural gas supplies](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter). Ms von der Leyen announced five proposals to ease Europe’s <strong>energy crisis</strong>, including a price cap on Russian gas and a windfall tax on energy companies, which she called a “solidarity contribution”.

China’s president, <strong>Xi Jinping</strong>, will meet his Russian counterpart, <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>, next week on his first foreign trip since the start of the covid-19 pandemic in 2020, according to Russia’s outgoing ambassador to China. The two are expected to meet in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, which hosts a summit of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, a Chinese-led talking shop focused on economic and security affairs in Asia.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Cineworld Group</strong>, the world’s second-largest cinema chain, filed for <strong>bankruptcy</strong> in Texas. The firm, which is based in London, intends to restructure its $9bn in debt and lease liabilities while maintaining theatre operations. The pandemic turbocharged [at-home streaming](https://www.economist.com/business/disney-netflix-apple-is-anyone-winning-the-streaming-wars/21807591) at cinemas’ expense: Cineworld lost $2.7bn in 2020 and another $566m last year.

A judge refused <strong>Elon Musk’s </strong>request to delay the trial over his aborted acquisition of <strong>Twitter</strong>, which is due to start on October 17th. But she allowed him to include in his lawsuit recent allegations of lax data privacy by the social-media firm’s former security chief. Mr Musk claims Twitter misled him about its user numbers and other metrics, and [wants out of the purchase agreement](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/11/with-or-without-elon-musk-twitter-is-overdue-a-shake-up).

<strong>China’s export</strong> growth slowed as global demand weakened and domestic covid-19 lockdowns and heatwaves [hit production](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/06/will-chinas-economy-ever-overtake-americas). Exports increased by 7.1% year on year in August, compared with 18% in July. Import growth was also sluggish because of tepid domestic demand. Asian stockmarkets slumped in response. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares fell to its lowest level in two years.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> €65bn, the minimum cost of Germany’s energy-bill relief package, equivalent to 1.8% of the country’s GDP. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/05/europe-scrambles-to-protect-citizens-from-sky-high-energy-prices).

## Bolsonaristas rally in Brazil

As well as the usual military parades, a fleet of tractors will lumber through Brazil’s capital, Brasília, on independence day on Wednesday. Farmers are just one group to show support for the country’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, ahead of a heavily-contested [election on October 2nd](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/07/14/might-jair-bolsonaro-try-to-steal-brazils-election). Supporters of the right-wing populist will take to the streets in other big cities too. In Rio de Janeiro, Mr Bolsonaro will meet fans on Copacabana Beach. 

The rallies are meant to drum up support for a president who is trailing in the polls. But <em>bolsonaristas </em>mistrust the surveys. They echo their leader’s unsupported claims that the country’s electronic voting system could easily be hacked. They accuse the [electoral court](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2021/09/11/jair-bolsonaro-fires-up-his-fans-by-attacking-judges) of bias in favour of his rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a leftist former president. Mr Bolsonaro has fanned these sentiments, calling on supporters to defend “transparency” and “liberty”. In turn, they have suggested that the president “call in the armed forces” and “clean out the Supreme Court”. If political tensions boil over, the parades could spill into violence.

## Another year, another iPhone

As has become the custom at Apple’s annual summits in Silicon Valley, on Wednesday the world’s biggest tech firm will show off a revamped [iPhone](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/07/31/apple-already-sold-everyone-an-iphone-now-what). Don’t expect anything revolutionary. The newest versions of Apple’s flagship will mainly have faster chips, better cameras and bigger screens. They will probably be more expensive: the top-of-the-line ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max, for instance, is expected to start at $1,199—$100 more than its predecessor.

  
 The event, which is the first in-person gathering since 2019, will probably also bring new AirPods, iPads and Apple Watches. But Apple is still mainly an iPhone company. The device accounted for nearly half of the firm’s sales between April and June, worth $83bn in total. Its smartphones now have more users in America than those running on Android, Google’s operating system, according to Counterpoint, a research firm. Apple’s next act is scheduled for next year, when it is likely to release a much-anticipated [mixed-reality headset](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/04/09/from-apple-to-google-big-tech-is-building-vr-and-ar-headsets).

## Japan’s phantom reopening

Tourists hoping to catch the tail end of summer in Japan will be disappointed. On Wednesday the country eased travel rules—but only a bit. Tourists will still be required to obtain visas and to book their travel through a certified agency. The one concession is that the tours no longer have to be guided. Citizens, permanent residents and business visitors will gain more, with fully vaccinated travellers relieved of the need to take a pre-departure PCR test. The daily cap on arrivals will rise from 20,000 to 50,000.

Japan has been [hyper-cautious about reopening](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/07/what-pandemic-border-closures-say-about-japans-view-of-outsiders) after the pandemic. That has left it lagging behind its peers in the G7 and neighbours in Asia, many of which have started welcoming tourists more readily. Yet the closed-door policies have been overwhelmingly popular with Japanese voters. With his approval ratings sliding, Kishida Fumio, [Japan’s prime minister](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/14/japan-should-stay-true-to-abe-shinzos-vision-up-to-a-point), is unlikely to take a risk on opening up more anytime soon.

## As safe as houses?

Like most central banks, the Bank of Canada is quickly [raising borrowing costs](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/08/30/central-bankers-worry-that-a-new-era-of-high-inflation-is-beginning). It is shaping up for another jump on Wednesday, from 2.5% to 3.25%. Inflation has come off its recent peaks but is still near 8%, pushed up by unsustainable wage growth and still-high expectations of future inflation.

But even more so than other rich countries, Canada faces acute risks from higher borrowing costs. In recent years there has been an [unprecedented housing boom](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/09/air-starts-to-seep-out-of-the-bubbly-canadian-property-market). Prices are more than 300% higher, in real terms, than in 2000. Higher interest rates will drive up mortgage costs, making homes less affordable and letting some of the air out of the bubbly property market. But household debt is worryingly high, at 185% of disposable income. Given that backdrop, falling house prices could deal a big blow to consumer confidence and weigh on spending more generally.

## Reality catches up with meme stocks

The [GameStop hype](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/01/29/as-trading-restrictions-are-lifted-the-gamestop-frenzy-continues) became a parable for America’s frenzied stockmarket. The American video-game retailer made headlines last January when an investor stampede pushed its share price up roughly 20-fold in three weeks. The rally was egged on by amateur investors on social media seeking to squeeze professional short-sellers who had bet against the company. GameStop’s sudden share-price volatility, exacerbated by online attention, made it the archetypal [“meme stock”](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/07/06/are-meme-stocks-harmless-fun-or-a-threat-to-the-financial-old-guard). 

On Wednesday the unlikely stockmarket star will deliver its quarterly earnings report. GameStop is still priced at over five times its value at the start of last year, despite lacklustre performance. The bricks-and-mortar business is trying to move online, but struggling to compete with behemoths like Amazon. The company also missed the boat on the crypto craze with ill-timed launches of an NFT marketplace and a digital wallet. Investors in [meme stocks](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/the-phenomenon-of-meme-stocks-could-be-here-to-stay) are guided more by hype than fundamentals, but reality always catches up eventually.
