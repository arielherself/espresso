<strong>Russia </strong>admitted that <strong>Ukrainian</strong> forces made a breakthrough in the southern region of <strong>Kherson</strong>, after Ukraine confirmed its full control of <strong>Lyman</strong>, a key logistics hub in Donetsk. The two regions were among the four that Russia [illegally annexed](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/30/vladimir-putin-illegally-annexes-four-ukrainian-oblasts) last week. Meanwhile Russia said it had not yet decided the borders of either Kherson or another annexed province, Zaporizhia. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, said it would “consult” populations in those areas.

Addressing the Conservative Party conference, Britain’s chancellor, <strong>Kwasi Kwarteng</strong>, said there had been a “[little turbulence](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/27/the-fallout-from-kwasi-kwartengs-mini-budget-continues)” after his “mini-budget” last week, but maintained that the economy needed a “new approach”. Earlier Mr Kwarteng dropped his [government’s plan](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/28/how-not-to-run-a-country) to abolish the 45% bracket for highest-earning taxpayers. Both he and the new prime minister, Liz Truss, had spent the weekend insisting they would not buckle.

[Svante Paabo](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/10/03/this-years-first-nobel-laureate-sequenced-the-dna-of-neanderthals), a Swedish geneticist, won the <strong>Nobel prize in physiology or medicine</strong>, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced. The Nobel committee said that Mr Paabo won the prize, worth 10m Swedish kroner ($895,000), “for his discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution”.

The cost of credit default swaps in <strong>Credit Suisse</strong> soared as the Swiss bank failed to restore [market confidence](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/28/investment-banks-are-sharpening-the-axe) in its liquidity. Reports that the bank was trying to raise capital had led to concerns about its financial strength. Investors sold shares and bonds with the bank, while seeking out CDS, which act as insurance against a company defaulting on debt.

<strong>Viktor Orban</strong>, Hungary’s prime minister, said Germany’s planned energy support package amounted to “cannibalism in the EU”. Last week Germany unveiled a €200bn ($196bn) “protective shield” for businesses and households struggling with energy bills. Mr Orban said the “bombshell” measure would distort fair competition in the single market and decried the absence of a [co-ordinated solution](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/05/europe-scrambles-to-protect-citizens-from-sky-high-energy-prices) to help European companies.

<strong>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</strong>, Iran’s supreme leader, expressed support for the country’s police, amid a harsh crackdown on [protests](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/29/irans-tired-regime-is-living-on-borrowed-time) in which more than 130 people have been killed. While Mr Khamenei said that the plight of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman whose death in custody sparked the [female-led rebellion](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/29/irans-ruling-ayatollahs-are-hanging-on), “deeply broke” his heart, he blamed the unrest on foreign enemies.

<strong>America’s </strong>manufacturing sector grew at its slowest pace in September since May 2020, as demand for new orders declined amid [aggressive interest rate rises](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/29/global-rate-rises-are-happening-on-an-unprecedented-scale) and high inflation. The Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing PMI, an index tracking factory activity, fell to 50.9. Economists had forecast 52.2; a reading below 50 indicates the sector is contracting.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> 100, the number of anti-mobilisation protests in Russia between September 21st and 26th. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/09/29/protests-erupt-across-russia).

## The Ukrainian answer to annexation

“The people of Donetsk…are becoming our citizens forever”, boasted Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, as he [annexed](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/30/vladimir-putin-illegally-annexes-four-ukrainian-oblasts) large chunks of Ukraine on Friday. A day later Ukraine’s army exposed the hollowness of that claim by recapturing a key city in the province. Ukrainian troops have also made significant progress in the southern province of Kherson, moving as much as 15-20km in 24 hours.

Russia, naturally, refuses to acknowledge either retreat, describing them euphemistically as moves to more advantageous positions. Its troops are thought to be establishing a new defensive line in the east, running from Troitske in the north to Svatove in the south. Despite Mr Putin’s threats to use nuclear weapons to protect Russian territory—including the newly annexed provinces—Ukraine’s army shows no sign of stopping its advance. Its next target appears to be Kreminna, a town which lies 30km east of Lyman. “There were more Ukrainian flags in the Donbas this week,” noted Mr Zelensky. “There will be even more next week.”

## Liz Truss’s party conference from hell

The Conservative Party’s annual conference ought to have been a victory lap for Liz Truss, who was elected the [new leader](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/28/how-not-to-run-a-country) barely a month ago. Instead, Britain’s prime minister is engulfed in recriminations after a bungled mini-budget [spooked investors](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/26/the-pound-is-plumbing-near-historical-depths-why). Dismay over Ms Truss’s mini-budget surfaced again on Sunday, as the conference took off. Michael Gove, a veteran former minister, declared her [tax cuts for high-earners](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically) risky and “a display of the wrong values”; on Monday morning the government reversed the proposed cut to the top rate of income tax. In his speech in the afternoon, [Kwasi Kwarteng](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/07/kwasi-kwarteng-is-bold-brainy-and-weird), the chancellor, pledged to push ahead with the rest of the fiscal package.

The party’s popularity has consequently imploded: a succession of polls show that the opposition Labour Party has opened leads in excess of 20 points over the Tories. Ms Truss’s disapproval rating is already worse even than her predecessor Boris Johnson at his lowest, according to Opinium, a pollster. Far from a dynamic fresh start, Ms Truss’s premiership looks like a continuation of the gridlock and infighting that has characterised all Tory governments in Britain since the Brexit vote of 2016. 

## The Supreme Court back in action

On Monday America’s justices—including a new jurist, Ketanji Brown Jackson—return to the bench. The term ahead could be as seismic as the last, when the Supreme Court revolutionised the law on guns, religion, environmental regulation and, most notoriously, [abortion](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/06/24/the-supreme-courts-rejection-of-roe-will-hurt-the-poorest-most). 

The first oral argument, a dispute over the reach of the Clean Water Act, pits a couple wanting to build a home near a lake in Idaho against the Environmental Protection Agency. Other cases will touch on flashpoints in American politics. On Tuesday, the court asks whether Alabama’s congressional map, which two lower courts found to be racially discriminatory, violates section two of the Voting Rights Act. On October 31st the court reconsiders its 44-year-old precedent permitting the consideration of race in university admissions. And later in the autumn state constitutional limits on partisan gerrymandering will be on the chopping block, and a website designer will argue she has a free-speech right (Colorado’s anti-discrimination law notwithstanding) to make websites for straight, but not gay, weddings. Nothing too controversial, then.

## Japanese politics and the ghost of Abe Shinzo

The ghost of Abe Shinzo continues to haunt his successor’s government. Last week’s state funeral for the slain former prime minister was [unpopular](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/09/26/the-fallout-from-abe-shinzos-murder-could-unseat-his-successor) owing to Abe’s controversial legacy, including his attempts to revise the pacifist constitution. Kishida Fumio’s approval ratings sagged the longer he defended it. On Monday Mr Kishida faced another ruckus; the opening of an extraordinary parliamentary session during which the opposition will probe the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s links with the Unification Church, a cult-like religious group. 

Abe’s assassination uncovered links between the LDP and the church, to which Abe himself was connected. The killer’s mother had joined the church, donating large sums of money until his family went bankrupt. An internal survey conducted by the LDP in late August revealed that nearly half of its 379 lawmakers had links to the church, from receiving campaign support to attending its events. For Mr Kishida’s part, he will try to use the session to refocus attention on his signature “New Capitalism” [agenda](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/02/12/kishida-fumios-new-capitalism-is-many-things-but-it-is-not-new).

## Building the human placenta on a microchip

The placenta bonds mother and baby, and exists only in gestation. The temporary organ gives the fetus nutrition and oxygen, while shielding it from infection. But it can also play a role in infants’ deaths. Placental malaria, for instance, kills 200,000 newborns and 10,000 mothers annually by clogging up placental blood vessels.

To better understand this pathology, researchers have developed the “placenta-on-a-chip”, described in the mid-September issue of the journal <em>Scientific Reports</em>. They cultured placental cells and umbilical cord cells on opposite ends of a microchip, to resemble the placental interface. They then incubated the chip, rocking it gently to push malaria-infected blood through it in both directions. Tests revealed that the flow of glucose was inhibited in the same way that would be expected in a real placenta. While not a perfect substitute, chips like this one could finally reveal the mysteries of the placenta and protect it from diseases and harmful drugs, just as it protected each of us.
