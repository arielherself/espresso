Diplomatic pressure to send <strong>Leopard tanks</strong> to<strong> Ukraine </strong>continued building on [Germany](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/01/20/a-meeting-in-germany-approves-more-arms-for-ukraine-but-no-leopard-tanks), their maker. Poland said it would apply for permission to send its own stock. Meanwhile, <strong>Russia</strong> ordered <strong>Estonia’s ambassador</strong>, Margus Laidre, to leave the country within a fortnight. The foreign ministry pinned the downgrade in relations on an “unfriendly step to radically reduce the size” of its own outpost in Tallinn.

<strong>Spotify</strong>, the world’s biggest audio streamer, will cut 6% of its global workforce, or 600 jobs, as the industry faces reduced advertising revenue amid a harsh economic downturn. It is [the latest technology company](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/22/big-business-is-in-for-a-rough-earnings-season) to restructure after a [pandemic-era hiring spree](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/11/03/what-big-tech-and-buy-out-barons-have-in-common-with-ge). More than 46,000 American tech workers have been shown the door so far this year, according to Crunchbase, a data provider.

Four members of America’s far-right<strong> Oath Keepers</strong> group were convicted of [seditious conspiracy](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/01/19/how-americas-far-right-flits-from-issue-to-issue) for participating in the Capitol riot on January 6th 2021. It is a rare charge, carrying a maximum prison sentence of 20 years. Just 14 of the almost 1,000 people criminally prosecuted for storming the Capitol have been charged with seditious conspiracy. 

<strong>Burkina Faso </strong>terminated a security pact with <strong>France</strong> that has seen 400 French troops stationed in the west African country to fight [jihadists in the Sahel](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/02/24/west-africas-coastal-states-are-bracing-for-a-jihadist-storm). The government—which [seized power in a coup](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/10/01/for-the-second-time-this-year-soldiers-stage-a-coup-in-burkina-faso) in September and has since reportedly cultivated ties with the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary outfit—gave France’s soldiers a month to pack up. French soldiers left neighbouring Mali last year.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Pakistan</strong> suffered a nationwide blackout, leaving nearly 220m people without electricity for the second time in three months. Like much of the country’s infrastructure, the electricity grid needs an expensive upgrade. Pakistan’s finances are already under pressure as the price of imported oil and gas, which the country relies on to generate most of its electricity, surged after Russia invaded Ukraine.

The death toll in Sunday’s [mass shooting](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2022/09/12/how-to-stop-the-killing) in <strong>Monterey Park</strong>, in Los Angeles, rose to 11 after an injured victim died in hospital. Police have not yet disclosed a motive for the attack. The 72-year-old suspect, Huu Can Tran, died after shooting himself in a van. Separately, on Monday, two students were killed in a shooting at an education nonprofit in Des Moines, Iowa.

<strong>Argentina</strong> and <strong>Brazil </strong>said they would begin preparatory work to develop a common South American currency. In a jointly written article, leaders of both countries said the currency—perhaps called the “sur”—would reduce costs and external vulnerability. According to the <em>Financial Times</em>, the proposal will be discussed at a summit in Argentina this week. It would be the world’s second-biggest currency bloc.

## China enters a new covid era

Three years ago the 11m people of Wuhan, a Chinese city, were the first to be locked down to stop the spread of a strange new virus. Covid-19 had actually emerged weeks earlier, but authorities played down its dangers, allowing millions to leave before the city and its surrounding province were sealed. But in 2023, after China abruptly [dropped](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/01/19/covid-19-has-already-torn-through-large-swathes-of-china) strict pandemic controls, the country’s rulers are intent on promoting a return to normality. Celebrations of the [lunar new year](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/01/19/riding-the-slow-train-in-china) holidays began over the weekend.

For unknown numbers of Chinese it is a more sombre new year. Official death tolls stand at around 70,000 between December 8th and January 19th. The true number is far higher, according to exhausted funeral workers and doctors. Millions heading to home towns and villages hope they will not infect elderly relatives, though it may help that many villagers have already had the virus. An exhausted country is ready to move on.

## Europe’s happy shoppers

In 2022, Europe’s consumers presented economists with a puzzle. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, consumer confidence—measured through surveys on households’ financial situation and their overall economic outlook—tanked. Europeans worried about the war’s impact on the rest of Europe, high energy costs and potential economic hardship. Economic forecasters feared a [recession](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/03/even-recession-may-not-bring-down-europes-inflation).

Yet spending in shops held up fairly well. That was because the labour market remained strong, the post-pandemic spending boom still had legs and governments transferred billions to households to help pay energy bills. Since then, prices for gas, power and fuel have come down to pre-war levels and a severe energy crisis has been [avoided](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/01/11/the-energy-crisis-and-europes-astonishing-luck). On Monday consumer sentiment in the euro area rose to its highest level since last February. The European consumer is not exactly known for pushing the world economy forward, but has nonetheless proved remarkably resilient in this crisis.

## Will Vladimir Putin order another mobilisation?

As the West promises more heavy weapons to Ukraine, rumours abound that Vladimir Putin will soon announce a [second wave](https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/01/16/a-russian-town-counts-the-cost-of-vladimir-putins-war) of mobilisation. Russia has not deployed all of the roughly 300,000 men recruited in the first drive, yet a new call-up would still be needed to sustain another large-scale offensive, which [Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/12/15/a-looming-russian-offensive) reckons will begin in the coming weeks. The recent appointment of [Valery Gerasimov](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/01/16/who-is-valery-gerasimov-russias-latest-commander-in-ukraine), Russia’s senior general, to take command of the invasion may also signal that a fresh attack is coming. 

For the offensive to stand a chance, claims Ukraine, Russia would have to call up half a million more men. That would be politically difficult. The first mobilisation sparked [widespread protests](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/09/29/protests-erupt-across-russia) in September; an estimated 700,000-800,000 men fled the country in one month. Families have become only more unsure about sending their loved ones off to war. Mr Putin is committed to his fight. His people will have to consider the costs—not that anyone is asking their opinion. 

## India’s banking boom

For years India’s economic growth was hindered by a [rotten banking sector](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/01/30/will-indias-government-act-to-save-its-public-sector-banks), plagued by bad loans and shoddy management. Now that constraint is easing. Banks’ credit growth rose to a ten-year high in December. Earlier in 2022, the share of bad loans fell to a seven-year low. The turnaround is a consequence of several factors. Government reforms to clean up balance-sheets have worked. A popular mobile-payments platform has brought more funds into the banking system.

Private banks are flourishing. On Saturday ICICI, the country’s second-biggest private bank, reported a 34% year-on-year increase in profits for the last quarter of 2022. Axis Bank, the third biggest, posted an increase of 62% as it reported results on Monday. A global economic slowdown will hurt momentum, but the central bank is not too worried. It predicts that, in the worst possible scenario this year, Indian banks will remain resilient. In the best case, they will thrive.

## Art in the desert

With its famous undulating roof line, the Canopy Terminal at Jeddah airport is often the first view that pilgrims enjoy when they land in Saudi Arabia for the Hajj. From Monday, it will also be home for three months to the first Islamic Arts Biennale, featuring an indoor exhibition that focuses on <em>qiblah</em> or the “sacred direction” and an open-air show about<em> hijrah</em>, or migration, that began with the journey that the Prophet Muhammad took from Mecca to Medina in 622. Forty-four artists have created works that examine how Islam’s most sacred sites give Muslims around the world a sense of community and belonging.

Politically, the Biennale is the latest expression of soft power by the crown prince, Muhammad bin Salman, and his cousin, Badr bin Farhan Al-Saud, the culture minister. They are keen to use art to project a gentler image for the kingdom after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist, and a huge increase in public executions in 2022.
