<strong>Hurricane Ian</strong> made landfall near Fort Myers, Florida. With wind speeds near 150mph (240kph), Ian is just shy of the category-five designation, the most severe; it is set to become one of the [strongest storms](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/06/01/why-this-atlantic-hurricane-season-is-predicted-to-be-unusually-stormy) on record to wallop America’s mainland. More than 800,000 people are already without power. Storm surges up to 18ft (5m) are expected along the coast of south-western Florida. Earlier Cuba experienced a blackout.

The <strong>Bank of England</strong> said it would start buying long-dated government bonds in a bid to calm markets and protect pension funds. The bank warned of a “material risk to UK financial stability” if chaos in the bond market continued. Trouble began after [Kwasi Kwarteng](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/27/the-fallout-from-kwasi-kwartengs-mini-budget-continues), the chancellor, announced a [new fiscal policy](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically) on Friday which triggered a collapse in the value of sterling, now around $1.06. Earlier, the IMF urged Britain’s leaders to “re-evaluate” the measures, which include £45bn ($48bn) of debt-funded tax cuts.

The <strong>[dollar](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/08/the-dollar-is-as-strong-as-ever-isnt-it)</strong> continued to run riot around the world, hitting 20-year highs against a group of major currencies on Wednesday. The euro sank further beneath parity, to 96 cents. And China’s <strong>offshore yuan </strong>plumbed an all-time low, at less than 7.2 per buck or 12% cheaper than it started the year. The yuan’s decline caused slumps in other Asian countries’ currencies, such as the South Korean won.

The EU said leaks from <strong>Nord Stream 1 and 2</strong>, [major gas pipelines](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/02/22/the-west-imposes-swift-sanctions-on-russia-can-they-stop-a-war) under the Baltic sea, were caused by sabotage, but stopped short of blaming Russia. Ursula Von Der Leyen, head of the European Commission, said deliberate disruption would receive the “strongest possible response”. Ms von der Leyen also proposed a new set of sanctions on Russia, including an oil price cap.

Officials in four <strong>Russian-controlled</strong> parts of <strong>Ukraine</strong> that held [sham referendums](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/27/in-fake-referendums-occupied-parts-of-ukraine-vote-to-join-russia) claimed that residents voted overwhelmingly to be annexed by Russia, ahead of the formal results. In response <strong>American</strong> officials said that they were preparing fresh military aid for Ukraine worth $1.1bn. Multiple countries, including Serbia, which has close ties with Moscow, said they would not recognise the referendums’ results.

Two firms developing an experimental <strong>Alzheimer’s drug</strong> published the results of a large clinical trial which shows it to have slowed down patients’ cognitive decline. Biogen and Eisai announced that their new medicine had reduced the disease’s progression by 27% compared with a placebo. Previous attempts to treat Alzheimer’s with drugs have been beset by [high-profile failures](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/07/23/critical-research-on-the-causes-of-alzheimers-may-have-been-falsified). 

SATS, a Singapore-based <strong>air freight</strong> and passenger services firm, agreed a $2.1bn deal to buy Worldwide Flight Services, the world’s biggest air cargo handler. The resumption of international travel as covid restrictions have eased has prompted a number of similar deals which bet on demand for logistics services rising.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>25,000, the number of Near Earth Objects—or space rocks—that are 140 metres across or bigger, thought to exist. If Earth were hit by some, the damage could be immense.

## Years of anger erupt in Iran

Over 11 nights now, throughout the country, Iranians have taken to the streets, braving violence and arrest to protest against their government. The spark was the death in custody earlier this month of a young woman detained by [morality police](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/26/who-are-irans-hated-morality-police) over her supposedly immodest clothes. But the protests have snowballed into an outpouring of anger against the regime. Chants of “freedom” and “death to the dictator” are not merely cries for tweaking headscarf laws. Many Iranians want more radical change.

The regime, of course, has [fought back](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/26/irans-rebellion-spreads-despite-lethal-repression). It has killed dozens of protesters, arrested countless more and branded them all as foreign agents. A familiar playbook, this—and probably enough to see it through yet another wave of unrest. But the theocracy’s rotten foundations look wobblier than ever. Iran’s economy is a mess (inflation is above 50%), the bureaucracy is unresponsive, and many Iranians are tired of their long isolation from the world. More unrest is inevitable.

## Sham votes in Russia-occupied Ukraine

Over the past week Ukrainians living in four Russian-occupied regions have “voted” on whether to join Russia. On Tuesday the Kremlin-backed puppet governments in those provinces—Kherson, Zaporizhia, Donetsk and Luhansk—claimed interim “results” in the [sham referendums](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/27/in-fake-referendums-occupied-parts-of-ukraine-vote-to-join-russia). Supposedly, between 87% and 99% voted in favour of being annexed by the invaders. Such ludicrous numbers should fool no one.

The question is what comes next. It is widely assumed that Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, will order the annexation of the four Ukrainian territories on Saturday in a speech before parliament. Many wonder whether he will draft men from those provinces to fight for Russia—on the spurious grounds that once these parts of Ukraine are absorbed, their residents will be Russian and liable for [conscription](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/24/how-russia-is-conscripting-men-to-fight-in-ukraine). A ban on military-age men leaving the occupied territories was unexpectedly lifted in recent days. But many were warned that the order would be reversed again on Saturday.

## The ECB’s geopolitical role

Central banks have their hands full fighting inflation while trying to preserve their economies from stagnating. The European Central Bank, in particular, has to grapple with a largely energy-driven price shock, the response to which is proving hard to get right. One way of preventing such big problems from running out of control in the future may be to encourage “geoeconomic co-operation” between Europe and America. That is the subject of a talk that Christine Lagarde, the head of the ECB, will give to the Atlantic Council, an American think-tank, on Wednesday. 

The main reason central banks are in such trouble is because global disruptions—a pandemic, war, broken supply chains—are messing with economies. Ms Lagarde will probably argue that America and Europe have a collective interest in strengthening co-operation to stabilise their economies, make supply chains more resilient and fight climate change. More interesting will be to see what Ms Lagarde thinks central banks can do to help. 

## Biden’s fight against hunger

The White House hosts a conference on Wednesday to tackle hunger, nutrition and health in America. Such food-related issues plague millions of Americans, especially the poor, rural communities and minorities. Growing obesity increases the risk of serious health problems. In 2020 about one in five American children was obese, nearly four times the share in 1970. The ratio is higher for black, Hispanic and poor children. Food-related disease is also costly. According to a study published by the American Diabetes Association, in 2017 diabetes cost America $327bn in direct medical costs and lost productivity. 

Mr Biden is expected to announce increased access to free school meals and incentives for the purchase of fruits and vegetables with food stamps, access to which will be expanded. He also wants to develop a more informative front-of-package labelling scheme like that in Europe. But with the [midterms](https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-midterms-2022/forecast/senate) looming, Mr Biden may not have support in Congress for long enough to see these measures through.

## “Blonde” has less Fun: Marilyn Monroe

Andrew Dominik’s film about Marilyn Monroe, released on Netflix on Wednesday, avoids all of the obvious biopic set-pieces: Norma Jeane Mortenson choosing her stage name, bleaching her hair or singing “Happy Birthday” to President John F. Kennedy. Instead, it jumps from one traumatic episode to the next. Adapted from a novel by Joyce Carol Oates, “Blonde” shows Monroe being beaten by her unstable mother (played by Julianne Nicholson) and her jealous husband (Bobby Cannavale), suffering through an abortion and a miscarriage, being raped by a studio president (David Warshovsky), and being used as a sex toy by an American president, presumably Kennedy (Caspar Phillipson).

Ana de Armas is uncannily convincing in the lead role, but all “Blonde” has to say about Monroe, over the course of 166 relentless minutes, is that she was a passive victim, defined not by her talent or drive but by her abusive relationships. Monroe, and Ms de Armas, deserve better.
