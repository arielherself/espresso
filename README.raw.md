<strong>Kevin McCarthy</strong> [lost three successive votes](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/01/04/republicans-struggle-to-elect-a-speaker-of-the-house) to become Speaker of America’s <strong>House of Representatives</strong>, after 20 far-right Republicans withheld their support. It marks the first time in a century that the lower chamber of Congress failed to elect a leader in a single poll. The rebels have coalesced behind Jim Jordan, though he lacks the support of the rest of the caucus. With their narrow majority, any Republican would need all but four of his party’s votes. Voting is to resume on Wednesday and will continue until a Speaker is chosen. 

<strong>America’s </strong>Food and Drug Administration will allow American chemists to stock <strong>“abortion pills”</strong>, even as access to the actual procedure is curtailed by the Supreme Court’s [repudiation of <em>Roe v Wade</em>](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/26/the-fallout-from-overturning-roe). [Mifepristone](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/02/05/a-safe-and-simple-abortion-option-becomes-more-readily-available), a drug used to induce abortions, had previously been available through clinics; now the federal government will allow any customer with a prescription to buy it. Roughly half of the state governments, however, ban it entirely.

<strong>Russia</strong> blamed a <strong>Ukrainian missile attack </strong>that killed 89 Russian troops on January 1st on its own soldiers’ using mobile phones. The defence ministry said the “mass use” of personal mobiles, which is banned, helped Ukrainian forces locate the troops in Makiivka, a [Russian-occupied](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/12/23/making-sense-of-vladimir-putins-war) town in the Donbas region. It had earlier admitted that 63 soldiers were killed in the strike; Ukraine has put the figure at about 400. 

<strong>Colombia’s</strong> largest remaining <strong>guerilla group</strong> denied agreeing to a six-month ceasefire announced on Saturday by [Gustavo Petro](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/06/who-is-gustavo-petro), the country’s president. Mr Petro, who has prioritised achieving [“total peace”](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/09/15/colombias-new-president-cosies-up-to-venezuelas-despot), had claimed to have reached a truce with Colombia’s five major rebel groups. But the National Liberation Army (ELN) countered that it had not been consulted—and “therefore no such agreement exists”.

<strong>Itamar Ben-Gvir</strong>, [Israel’s new far-right](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/29/israels-new-government-is-the-most-right-wing-ever) national security minister, sparked Palestinian outrage as he visited the compound containing the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. Sacred to both Muslims and Jews, the holy site is run by a Jordanian-led Islamic council. Jews can enter the compound, but Jewish prayer is not permitted—a measure [Mr Ben-Gvir](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/11/03/who-is-itamar-ben-gvir-israels-kingmaker) previously threatened to overturn. The Palestinian foreign ministry called his visit an “unprecedented provocation”.

<strong>Twitter</strong> said it would expand the types of <strong>political advertising </strong>permitted on its platform, reversing a ban on all such ads implemented in 2019. The firm also said it would relax its policy towards “cause-based ads”. The changes are the latest in a series of shake-ups introduced by Elon Musk, who has mostly spooked advertisers since [buying Twitter](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/12/19/elon-musks-44bn-education-on-free-speech) in October.

<strong>Sam Bankman-Fried</strong> pled not guilty to [eight criminal charges](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/13/the-game-is-up-for-sam-bankman-fried), including wire fraud and money laundering, in a federal court in New York. Prosecutors allege that Mr Bankman-Fried, who presided over the collapse of FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, illegally diverted customer funds to his trading firm. He is out of jail and confined to his parents’ home in California under the terms of his $250m bail agreement.

## The battle for Republican leadership

Before America’s House of Representatives broke up for Christmas, some Republican lawmakers were seen sporting a peculiar lapel badge. “OK”, it read, standing for “Only Kevin”: a rallying cry against the “Never Kevins”––rebel Republicans who had vowed to oppose Kevin McCarthy’s bid for House Speaker, the leader of the larger party in the chamber. 

Speaker contests are typically straightforward: none since 1923 has required more than a single vote. On Tuesday, however, 19 Republican members voted against Mr McCarthy in the initial poll; he could afford to lose only four. Mr McCarthy, who was the minority leader before Republicans took the House in November’s midterms, is unusual in that he is both a Donald Trump [loyalist](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/12/18/donald-trumps-popularity-with-republican-voters-is-sinking) and an establishment figure. Hoping to win over the hard-right Never Kevins, he had earlier conceded to some of their demands. He will now have to haggle with diminished leverage, and others are also likely to put their names forward. It marks a chaotic start to the new congressional session for a Republican party already [hobbled](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/13/the-democrats-keep-control-of-the-senate) by division. 

## Mexico raises its minimum wage

This week the legal minimum wage in Mexico increased to 207.44 pesos ($10.66) a day, or 312.41 pesos for workers in the northern border area abutting the United States. Mexicans will welcome the extra cash, which represents a 22% rise on last year’s figure. Between 2018 and 2020 the poverty rate increased from 42% to 44% of the population, and the pandemic then made things worse. President [Andrés Manuel López Obrador](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/11/24/mexicos-president-wants-to-develop-the-poorer-south) has continually increased the minimum wage since taking office in 2018. By 2026, he says, it should be sufficient to buy food for a family of four. 

Still, not everyone likes the larger [pay packets](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/03/19/why-mexicos-economy-underperforms). Some economists fret the wage boost will push up inflation, already running high at 7.8%. Indeed, for the approximately 60% of Mexican workers who toil in the informal sector, that may be the only effect they see.

## Labour markets are the bright spot in the world economy

Amid all the talk about impending recession, there is one bright spot: labour markets. In most recessions unemployment soars, as firms stop hiring and lay off staff. After the 2008 financial crash, for example, the rich world’s unemployment rate rose from 5.8% to close to 9%. But at the beginning of 2023 there is scant evidence of labour-market carnage. Jobs numbers from America, out on Friday, will show that unemployment in the world&#x27;s largest economy remains very low. Indeed, the biggest problem appears to be shortages of workers, not jobs. Wage growth is still exceptionally strong, especially given weak productivity growth. 

Admittedly, there is evidence that labour demand is starting to weaken in some places. Notably, employment growth in America has slowed sharply from the dizzying heights of late 2021. Yet it would take an awful lot to return to the dark days of the early 2010s. At 4.9%, unemployment across the rich world is at its lowest level in decades. 

## Xi and Marcos smile for the cameras

On Tuesday Ferdinand “Bongbong” [Marcos](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/08/04/is-bongbong-marcoss-early-pragmatism-a-paradox-or-an-illusion), president of the Philippines, began a state visit to China. Mr Marcos and Xi Jinping, China’s president, will stress the friendlier, commercial aspects of their countries’ relations, rather than their overlapping claims to parts of the[ South China Sea](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/01/15/china-does-not-have-it-all-its-way-in-the-south-china-sea). There, fishing vessels crewed by Chinese militiamen persist in obstructing access to waters where international law gives the Philippines exclusive rights to catch fish, and to tap any oil and natural gas that may be found. 

If these spats were to escalate into violence, America, as the Philippines’s ally, could be dragged in. Nobody wants war over seafood and what, for now, is the mere promise of gas, so Mr Xi and Mr Marcos will keep up the appearance of friendship. The pretence will last as long as the Philippines muffles its protests about Chinese bullying—and China moderates its strong-arm tactics. 

## Elena Ferrante on Netflix

The coming-of-age tale is a literary staple. Fans of Elena Ferrante, an Italian superstar author, have devotedly followed her characters as they learn the harsh truths of adult life. The latest is Giovanna, a teenager in Naples whose tortured adolescence has now made it from page to screen. “The Lying Life of Adults,” an adaptation of Ms Ferrante’s most recent novel, is now streaming on Netflix worldwide.

The show shares themes with the television series of Ms Ferrante’s previous novels, a quartet beginning with “My Brilliant Friend”, which depicted the heroines Elena and Lila. It strips bare the ugliness of male entitlement and female rage, and seesaws between a poor working-class neighbourhood and the posh homes of wealthy intellectuals. But stylistically the programmes could not be more different. Whereas the first show was straightforward Hollywood, Giovanna’s story is more Italian new wave: fragmented and cryptic. Watch it for the visual treat and Ms Ferrante’s harsh truths: men are monsters—but women can be, too.
