Explosions were reported at a military base in Russian-occupied <strong>Crimea</strong>, damaging a munition depot; the cause is currently unknown. Separately, <strong>Ukraine</strong> claimed to have struck and destroyed a forward base of the [Wagner Group](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/03/07/what-is-the-wagner-group-russias-mercenary-organisation), a <strong>Russian mercenary outfit</strong>, in Ukrainian territory. Ukraine also said that Russia was trying to advance on several towns in the Donetsk region. There was more shelling around <strong>Zaporizhzhia</strong>, Europe’s [biggest nuclear plant](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2022/06/16/nuclear-plants-could-become-dirty-bombs-in-ukraine-warns-serhii-plokhy), now in Russian hands. The United Nations’ atomic-energy agency said it was ready to inspect the site, despite Russia’s reservations.

<strong>Tencent</strong>, China’s [biggest tech firm](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/08/11/tencent-is-a-success-story-bedevilled-by-the-splinternet), will reportedly sell all or much of its $24bn stake in <strong>Meituan</strong>, a food delivery platform, partly in an attempt to mollify the Chinese government. Shares of Meituan dropped by over 10% following the report from Reuters, while Tencent’s fell by more than 2%. Since late 2020 Chinese regulators have cracked down on tech giants such as Tencent.

<strong>Australia’s </strong>prime minister, [Anthony Albanese](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/05/22/what-australias-new-government-will-do), said his predecessor, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, “undermined our democracy” by surreptitiously awarding himself authority over several ministries during the pandemic. Mr Morrison was discovered to have taken the home affairs and treasury portfolios, as well as previously uncovered secret roles as health, finance and resources minister. Some of his nominal ministers were unaware. However, they are, like Mr Albanese, now incensed.

<strong>Finland</strong> said it will cut the number of <strong>visas </strong>issued to Russian nationals to 10% of the current volume, beginning September 1st. Many Russian tourists circumvent bans on Russian planes by transiting through Finland towards European holiday spots. Finland said it is also considering creating humanitarian visas for Russians seeking to flee the country. Finland and Estonia have called for a EU-wide visa ban on Russian nationals, a move supported by Ukraine but opposed by Germany.

<strong>Kenya’s </strong>election commission declared <strong>William Ruto</strong>, the country’s deputy president, winner of the [presidential election](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/15/william-ruto-is-declared-kenyas-next-president) held on August 9th, two hours after its constitutional deadline. But four of the commissioners refused to endorse the result. The campaign of <strong>Raila Odinga</strong>, the candidate endorsed by Uhuru Kenyatta, the outgoing president, also cast doubts on the results, which they said could not be verified.

America’s <strong>Department of Justice</strong> asked a judge not to release the affidavit that enabled it to [search](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/09/an-fbi-raid-on-donald-trumps-home-ignites-a-political-firestorm) <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> Florida estate, saying that would jeopardise its investigations into the former president. Mr Trump is suspected of stashing classified documents, which he denies. Meanwhile, prosecutors in <strong>Georgia </strong>notified <strong>Rudy Giuliani</strong> that he is a target of their criminal investigation into possible attempts to overturn results from the 2020 presidential election.

<strong>Third Point</strong>, an activist-investor fund run by Daniel Loeb, disclosed a hefty stake in <strong>Disney</strong> and urged the firm to consider selling ESPN, its sports broadcaster, to take full control of Hulu, a streaming service in which it has a large investment, and to shake up its board. Disney’s costs—among the industry’s highest, says Mr Loeb—must also be slashed. The firm spent heavily fighting in the “[streaming wars](https://www.economist.com/business/disney-netflix-apple-is-anyone-winning-the-streaming-wars/21807591)”.

<strong>Correction: </strong>an earlier version of The World in Brief said Raila Odinga is a former president of Kenya. He is in fact a former prime minister. Sorry.

## Trump’s power is tested in the western states

Two primary elections on Tuesday will offer tests of Donald Trump’s hold over the Republican Party. The more consequential of the two is in Wyoming, where Liz Cheney will fight to keep the Republican nomination for the state’s seat in the House of Representatives. Ms Cheney has been the loudest Republican critic of Mr Trump since his supporters invaded the Capitol last year.

That has annoyed Ms Cheney’s party. In one recent survey only 28% of likely Republican voters said they would back her. Harriet Hageman, a lawyer endorsed by Mr Trump, looks set to head to Washington in her place. (In deep-red Wyoming, the winner of the Republican primary is almost guaranteed to win the general election in November.)

In Alaska, meanwhile, Sarah Palin will attempt a comeback. The Trump-endorsed former governor and vice-presidential candidate is chasing the state’s lone House seat. Ms Hageman and Ms Palin may be on the ballots, but it is Mr Trump’s enduring influence that will be on observers’ minds.

## Walmart’s dicey earnings

The pandemic wrought havoc on American retailers’ schedules. Supply-chain logjams caused shortages and delays; demand, and prices, soared. Now shops have the opposite problem. Many stockpiled more inventory than consumers—cautious of spending as inflation eats into their wages—want. So retailers are posting heavy discounts in order to flog their goods.

Yet on Tuesday, Walmart revealed that things weren’t as bad as investors feared. It reported quarterly revenue up 8% year-on-year, ahead of expectations. Customers have had little choice but to put up with rising food prices, which has boosted Walmart’s huge grocery business. But sales of less essential higher-margin products, such as clothing and electronics, have slowed. But the company warned investors that things might get worse: it said full-year earnings will decline 9-11%.

## Brazil’s presidential campaign kicks off

On Tuesday candidates for the Brazilian presidency, Congress and state governments will begin campaigning ahead of elections on October 2nd. There are 12 candidates in the presidential race, of whom two are already well ahead. Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a former president, is polling at around 40%, more than ten points in front of [Jair Bolsonaro](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/07/14/might-jair-bolsonaro-try-to-steal-brazils-election), who is seeking re-election.

Mr Bolsanaro’s prospects have improved in recent weeks, thanks in part to prodigious handouts. In July he upped the value of a monthly cash-transfer programme which covers 10% of the population. His strategy seems to be working. Between January and August, his popularity grew by five percentage points among the poorest voters, and by ten among female voters, groups that usually disapprove of him. But Lula is still the front-runner. So as well as handouts, Mr Bolsonaro (true to form) has started promoting conspiracy theories that the vote might be rigged.

## Kenya’s new president (for now) is William Ruto

In a country with a troubled voting history, Kenya’s presidential election had seemed to be going well. No previous count had seemed so transparent, with results forms posted online for all to scrutinise. But as it became apparent that William Ruto, the deputy president, would be [declared the winner](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/15/william-ruto-is-declared-kenyas-next-president), chaos erupted.

Aides to Raila Odinga, Mr Ruto’s challenger, announced that the electoral commission had been compromised. The electoral commission itself then split. Four of its seven members questioned the result, giving neither explanation nor evidence. When the commission’s chairman, Wafula Chebukati, attempted to declare Mr Ruto’s victory, he was attacked by Odinga loyalists.

Mr Chebukati eventually succeeded in declaring that Mr Ruto had won 50.5% of the votes. But Mr Odinga, who is supported by the departing president, Uhuru Kenyatta, is certain to appeal.

## How a simpler voice box set mankind apart

The human voice box, or larynx, is a fantastically subtle organ. From this fleshy, cartilaginous structure has emerged all the sung music and spoken languages of the world. And yet in other primates, near-identical biological arrangements produce only shrieks and grunts. Now research in <em>Science</em>, a journal, has explained why humans alone possess the gift of speech. By scanning the larynges of 43 non-human primate species, scientists may have found what separates man from monkey.

The answer is not a missing link but an extra one. The larynx of every primate other than <em>Homo sapiens</em> contains additional membranes called vocal lips. Experiments on anaesthetised monkeys, along with acoustic modelling, confirm that these make for unstable, irregular vocalisation. At some point in evolutionary history humans shed these membranes, yielding a simpler and more controllable voice box. By enabling the capacity for speech, this may have been a key step in the ascent of man. In evolution, as in speech, less is often more.
