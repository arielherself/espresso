Authorities in the Bahamas arrested <strong>Sam Bankman-Fried</strong>, the former boss of <strong>FTX</strong>, at the request of American prosecutors who have filed unspecified criminal charges against him. Those charges are due to be unveiled on Tuesday; the Bahamas is expected to extradite him in short order. Mr Bankman-Fried presided over the [implosion of FTX](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/11/17/the-failure-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried-will-leave-deep-scars), a crypto exchange, after it lent customer funds to his nominally separate trading firm.

Volodymyr Zelensky, <strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, asked G7 leaders for modern tanks and long-range weapons amid heavy fighting in his [country’s east](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/12/06/russia-is-hurling-troops-at-the-tiny-ukrainian-town-of-bakhmut). The G7 promised to “meet Ukraine’s urgent requirements”. Separately, Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, cancelled his regular year-end news conference. In the past he has allowed foreign press to pose questions at the event.

The president of the<strong> European Parliament</strong> said there would be “no impunity” for EU officials implicated in a [cash-for-influence scandal](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/09/06/corruption-in-europes-health-services-is-surprisingly-common) involving Qatar. On Monday police executed more raids. So far 19 homes and offices have been searched and six people arrested, including Eva Kaili, one of the parliament’s vice-presidents.

<strong>Hungary</strong> and other <strong>EU</strong> countries reached a tentative resolution to their protracted [funding disagreement](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/11/24/the-eu-is-withholding-aid-to-press-hungary-to-reform). The bloc will release €5.8bn ($6.1bn) in pandemic aid to Hungary and reduce the amount it withholds from a separate pot, to €6.3bn (down from €7.5bn), over rule-of-law concerns. In return Hungary will support an aid package for Ukraine worth €18bn and enact 27 governance reforms.

<strong>Indian</strong> and <strong>Chinese </strong>troops sustained “minor injuries” in a clash at the countries’ disputed border in the Himalayas, according to Indian sources. The incident took place Friday in a north-eastern Indian state claimed by Beijing, but was not reported until Monday. Twenty-four soldiers died when the border dispute last [flared up](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/09/22/some-progress-in-the-border-dispute-between-china-and-india) in 2020; relations between the countries remain frosty.

In 2021 global public and private <strong>debt</strong> as a share of economic output posted the steepest annual decline in 70 years, to 247% of GDP, according to the <strong>IMF</strong>. Pandemic-induced [bailouts](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/25/the-world-enters-a-new-era-bail-outs-for-everyone) saw the debt-to-GDP ratio rise by 29 percentage points in 2020. Amid inflation and the economic rebound it fell by 10 percentage points last year. An IMF official called 2021 a “very unusual year”.

<strong>Peru’s</strong> new president, Dina Boluarte, said she would submit plans to Congress to bring forward elections, following protests demanding her resignation. Demonstrations have rocked Peru since Pedro Castillo, who was president until last week, was arrested after a [bungled coup attempt](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/12/07/after-a-bungled-coup-attempt-perus-president-falls) on Wednesday. Supporters of Mr Castillo have called Ms Boluarte, who was his vice-president, a “traitor”.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>$56bn, the projected value in 2030 of the global market for webtoons, a type of South Korean cartoon. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/12/08/japanese-manga-are-being-eclipsed-by-korean-webtoons).

## The EU’s strenuous series of summits

Ukraine will once again focus the minds of the EU’s 27 foreign ministers as they gather in Brussels on Monday. National leaders will also convene later in the week. The bloc is looking to adopt its ninth sanctions package against Russia, adding nearly 200 individuals and three banks to its blacklist. It also wants to send €18bn ($19bn) in financial aid to Ukraine.

This may prove tricky. Both the sanctions and the aid require the unanimous approval of EU governments. But Hungary and its autocratic prime minister, Viktor Orban, have threatened to veto both dossiers unless Brussels releases [billions of euros in funding ](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/11/24/the-eu-is-withholding-aid-to-press-hungary-to-reform)earmarked for Hungary (the EU is holding back over concerns around [corruption](https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/04/05/the-eu-is-tolerating-and-enabling-authoritarian-kleptocracy-in-hungary) and the independence of the judiciary). The week will be spent trying to cajole Mr Orban into a deal, or finding a way to sidestep Hungary, such as by adopting the measures multilaterally. In either case, the summits could quickly turn hot-tempered.

## Mexico’s president goes after the electoral institute

A controversial electoral-reform package, which in mid-November sparked the biggest protests since Andrés Manuel López Obrador became [president](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/11/24/mexicos-president-wants-to-develop-the-poorer-south) in 2018, will this week be debated, and perhaps passed, by Mexico’s Senate. The reform, which the lower house rushed through last week, would undermine Mexico’s electoral authority, INE, cutting its budget and weakening its ability to punish breaches of electoral law. Rules on campaigning and propaganda by public servants would also be loosened.

Even though Mr López Obrador had to water down his initial constitutional reform (for lack of the necessary two-thirds majority in parliament) he would see any strike at the INE as a win. He has long alleged—against all evidence—that he lost elections in 2006 and 2012 because the body endorsed fraudulent results. But the reform would be a loss for Mexico. The authoritarian rule of the [Institutional Revolutionary Party](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2017/11/30/jose-antonio-meade-is-the-pris-candidate-for-mexicos-presidency) ended in 2000, after seven decades, thanks to the electoral framework painstakingly built during Mexico’s transition to democracy.

## India’s largest winemaker goes public

India is hardly wine country. In most places intense heat hinders production. Many of the country’s states limit or prohibit the sale of alcohol. And where it is allowed, Indians prefer the harder stuff of whiskey and country liquor. But a growing affluent class is acquiring a [taste for wine](https://www.economist.com/business/2018/12/15/indias-wine-industry-is-growing-in-the-most-delightful-way). Over the next three years, the value of India’s wine sales, currently worth $160m, is expected to grow by 23% annually.

Much of that is down to Sula Vineyards, which launches on Mumbai’s stockmarket, the BSE, at a valuation of $353m on Monday. It established its vineyards in 1999 in Nashik, 160km north-east of Mumbai, and has combined clever marketing, which includes running an annual dance-music festival, with sweeter-than-mainstream wines that cater to local tastes. Other vineyards have followed, but Sula still holds more than half the domestic market. Despite turbulence in financial markets that has caused recent IPOs in India to flop, Sula’s owners are hoping that investors will nonetheless take a swig.

## Britain’s cranky labour force

Britons weary of the train strikes that have uprooted their routines since June will have no festive respite. The RMT, a trade union representing the country’s transport workers, plans five more work stoppages over the next month. The RMT’s members are unlikely to accept the latest pay offer from their bosses in a ballot that ends on Monday; the union has encouraged them to reject the deal.

Labour unrest is [seeping across Britain](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/11/03/britain-faces-a-wave-of-industrial-action-this-winter). Nurses will undertake their largest-ever strikes on December 15th and December 20th. Midwives will decide on Monday whether to hold their own walk-out. Some civil servants, some baggage handlers at Heathrow airport and Eurostar security staff also stop work this week. December is on track to become Britain’s most-disrupted month since 1989. [Double-digit inflation](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/08/17/british-inflation-hits-double-digits) is largely the culprit as workers battle for larger pay increases to keep pace with the cost of living. The government will convene its emergency committee, Cobra, on Monday to discuss the disruption. But there is little end in sight. 

## Homage to an age-old tale

This week a tribute to “Beauty and the Beast”, Disney’s animated film of 1991, will be shown on ABC and Disney+. It will feature clips from the musical, showing off its sumptuous blend of hand-drawn and digital art, and tunes performed by an all-star cast.

The film’s best-known song declares the story to be a “Tale As Old As Time”. It is indeed [rather old](https://www.economist.com/culture/2021/12/29/a-new-exhibition-shows-the-visual-debt-disney-owes-to-european-art): a version may have existed in oral form 4,000 years ago. In 1740 Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve, a French novelist, penned a long account of a reclusive beast and the young woman who falls in love with him. Sixteen years later Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont turned that work into a short fairy tale. Since then it has been adapted into umpteen films—Disney even released a [live-action remake](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/01/05/disney-goes-back-to-the-future), starring actors, in 2017—as well as operas and plays. Its themes, of prejudice, outward appearances and female independence, have resonated through the ages.
