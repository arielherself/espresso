Public funeral events for<strong> Elizabeth II </strong>concluded with a service at Windsor Castle, where [the queen](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2022/09/08/elizabeth-ii-never-laid-down-the-heavy-weight-of-the-crown) was buried in a private ceremony. A state funeral took place on Monday morning at Westminster Abbey, attended by Joe Biden, Emmanuel Macron and around 500 other foreign dignitaries. The ceremonies, which drew large crowds of mourners, mark the end of ten days of [national mourning](https://www.economist.com/queen-elizabeth).

A <strong>Russian missile </strong>struck a Ukrainian nuclear plant on Monday, landing around 300m away from the reactors, according to Ukrainian authorities. The head of Energoatom, the national nuclear energy firm, described the attack on Pivdennoukrainsk station in the country’s southern Mykolaiv region as “[nuclear terrorism](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/14/do-russias-military-setbacks-increase-the-risk-of-nuclear-conflict)”. Separately, the Kremlin <strong>denied </strong>having committed war crimes in the eastern Kharkiv region, where a [Ukrainian counter-offensive](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/15/a-stunning-counter-offensive-by-ukraines-armed-forces) has uncovered mass graves with bodies carrying evidence of torture.

<strong>Hurricane Fiona</strong> made landfall in the <strong>Dominican Republic</strong>. Torrential rain and winds of 90mph triggered mudslides that forced roads and businesses to close in the east of the Caribbean country. Damage to aqueducts has left over 1m people without running water. Over the weekend the storm battered neighbouring <strong>Puerto Rico</strong>, killing several people and cutting off power to 1.3m residents.

<strong>Russia </strong>and <strong>China </strong>agreed to carry out more joint military exercises and strengthen their defence co-operation after a meeting between officials on Monday. Yang Jiechi, China’s top diplomat, hosted Nikolai Patrushev, the head of Russia’s security council, in south-eastern Fujian province. Despite recent disagreements between the two countries over Russia’s botched [invasion of Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/18/where-next-for-ukraines-army), the Chinese foreign ministry re-affirmed that they “always firmly support each other on issues concerning each other’s core interests.”

Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland have <strong>banned Russian travellers</strong> from crossing their borders as of Monday to press Russia to reverse its [invasion of Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/ukraine-crisis). Exceptions include those travelling on humanitarian grounds, dissidents and family members of EU citizens. <strong>Finland</strong>, which also shares a border with Russia, has reduced the number of tourist visas to a tenth of its current total but decided against a ban.

The <strong>Taliban </strong>exchanged Mark Frerichs, an American engineer, for Bashir Noorzai, an Afghan tribal leader with connections to the [terrorist group](https://www.economist.com/leaders/the-taliban-are-shackling-half-the-afghan-population/21808483). Mr Noorzai helped finance the Taliban in the 1990s and was arrested in 2005 for running one of the world’s largest drug-smuggling operations. Mr Frerichs, who had been working in Afghanistan as a contractor, was abducted by the Taliban in February 2020.

A judge in <strong>Baltimore</strong> overturned the murder conviction of <strong>Adnan Syed</strong>, freeing him after he had served more than 20 years of a life sentence for the killing of his former girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, in 1999. Mr Syed’s case was thrown back into the spotlight in 2014 by the award-winning true-crime podcast “Serial”, which [raised questions](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2018/11/26/serial-moves-away-from-exploring-extraordinary-cases) over his guilt and the conduct of his lawyer. Prosecutors in Maryland must now decide whether to pursue a new trial or drop the charges altogether.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>99%, the share of Kenyan migrant workers abused in the Gulf, according to a poll. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/15/in-the-gulf-99-of-kenyan-migrant-workers-are-abused-a-poll-finds).

## Republicans struggle to self-define

On Monday [Kevin McCarthy](https://www.economist.com/united-states/kevin-mccarthys-accidental-truthfulness/21808964), the Republican leader in the House of Representatives, is set to unveil his party’s “Commitment to America”. Consciously modelled after the “Contract with America”—a prospectus of what Republicans would do if they won the House in 1994, which helped them win back control of Congress in midterm election—Mr McCarthy’s similarly aims to pinpoint [what Republicans stand for](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/08/15/republicans-are-falling-out-of-love-with-america-inc).

But the party has shown little interest in sketching a policy agenda. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, believes such documents are counterproductive, and will not weigh in. Rick Scott, a senator from Florida, has pitched a plan under which all federal legislation would expire after five years unless explicitly reauthorised. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina befuddled many last week when he pitched a nationwide abortion limit at 15 weeks—which would be stricter than in many blue states. Expect more policy incoherence.

## Queen Elizabeth II is laid to rest

On Monday, just before 11am, the coffin of [Queen Elizabeth II](https://www.economist.com/obituary/2022/09/08/elizabeth-ii-never-laid-down-the-heavy-weight-of-the-crown) was carried to Westminster Abbey, where she was crowned almost [70 years ago](https://www.economist.com/films/2022/09/08/queen-elizabeth-iis-reign-in-numbers). Back then, a lady-in-waiting suggested to her, just before she went into her coronation, that she must be nervous. Yes, Elizabeth replied. And added—referring to a horse that she had running in a race four days later—“I really do think Aureole will win.”

In the [intervening decades](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/09/08/britains-longest-serving-ruler-strengthened-the-monarchy), it was less for her humour than her solemn devotion to duty that she would become known: she crossed the world, smiling, waving and working. She swore in her final prime minister, her fifteenth, just two days before she died. Now, people are coming to her: [thousands queued](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/15/why-britons-love-to-queue) to see her coffin and world leaders, including Joe Biden, converged on London to see her funeral—and the close of an Elizabethan era.

## The Global Fund replenishes its coffers

The [Global Fund](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2019/10/10/how-to-defeat-aids-malaria-and-tuberculosis), founded in 2002 by governments and businesses with the purpose of fighting [AIDS](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/03/do-not-let-hiv-and-aids-slide-down-the-priority-list), [malaria](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/09/08/a-new-malaria-vaccine-shows-promising-results) and [tuberculosis](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/most-resistance-causing-mutations-in-tb-have-now-been-identified/21805727), holds its so-called replenishment meeting in New York on Monday. It wants to raise $18bn to spend over the next three years in order to save 20m lives. The fund’s track record suggests it would use that money wisely. Its officials claim to have prevented 50m deaths between 2002 and 2021. Last year the fund helped put 23.3m people on antiretroviral HIV drugs, treat 5.3m people for tuberculosis and distribute 133.2m mosquito nets.

But covid has proved a [setback](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/08/02/despite-setbacks-hiv-can-be-beaten). Key metrics for all three diseases worsened in 2020, including the percentage of people treated for TB, which fell from 69% to 57%. Deaths from the infection rose for the first time in a decade. The successful alliance of governments and the private sector will need to continue rising to the challenge.

## Japan’s knotty celebration of longevity

On Monday Japan celebrates its <em>Keiro no Hi</em> or “Respect for the Aged Day”, a public holiday. While covid has halted annual events and gatherings for a third consecutive year, Japanese still mark it by sending gifts to grandparents, a boon for e-commerce firms.

But the celebration of [Japan’s longevity](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/02/05/japan-is-searching-for-the-secrets-to-healthy-old-age) is also a reminder of the country’s deepening demographic woes. Recently published statistics show the number of people aged 65 and over in Tokyo, the capital, reached a record level this year. Across the whole of Japan their share is around 30%. In April the country [dropped its legal age for adulthood](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/creating-new-adults-will-not-slow-japans-ageing) from 20 to 18, creating roughly 2m “new” adults overnight.

[Japanese seniors](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/06/16/elderly-japanese-are-discovering-the-benefits-of-cannabis-products) appear increasingly ambivalent about the holiday. Many who are active and working distance themselves from the event. Some take offence to being called “old”. As much as filial piety matters in Japan, <em>Keiro no Hi</em> may need a rejuvenation.

## Stop the sun, refreeze the poles

[Stratospheric aerosol injections](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/02/27/dusting-the-upper-atmosphere-could-help-counter-climate-change) may sound like a wacky way to wind back climate change. A fleet of aircraft pump fine dust into the upper atmosphere until it sheaths the entire planet, reflecting sunlight and cooling the Earth. But when limited to polar regions, which are [warming at a faster pace](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/03/24/parts-of-antarctica-have-been-40degc-warmer-than-their-march-average) than the rest of the world, SAI begins to look less far-fetched.

A new study published in <em>Environmental Research Communications</em>, a journal, finds that SAI could be deployed to refreeze the poles. Microscopic aerosol particles would be released at latitudes of 60 degrees north and south, and drift poleward to shade the ice. This, say the modellers, would cool the Arctic and Antarctica by 2°C per year, which would slow the pace of sea-level rise. But the method also has its drawbacks: considerable extra carbon emitted by roughly 125 tanker aircraft and an estimated cost of $11bn a year.
