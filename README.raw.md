<strong>Volodymyr Zelensky</strong>, Ukraine’s president, is expected to ask the <strong>G7</strong>, a group of rich democracies, to supply it with more weapons at an emergency meeting called in response to a barrage of Russian missiles targeting [Ukrainian cities](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/10/russia-launches-a-wave-of-missiles-across-ukraine). President Joe Biden has already promised more support for Ukraine, including air-defence systems. Meanwhile <strong>Belarus</strong> ordered the deployment of troops alongside Russian forces on its border with Ukraine.

<strong>China</strong> has ramped up [anti-covid measures](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/09/08/public-patience-with-zero-covid-is-wearing-thin-in-china) in some big cities ahead of the Communist Party’s [five-yearly congress](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/29/how-to-make-sense-of-xi-jinping-chinas-enigmatic-ruler), which begins in Beijing on Sunday. To counter an uptick in infections after the National Day holiday [Shanghai](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/06/30/getting-around-covid-controls-in-shanghai) has locked down some neighbourhoods, closed entertainment venues and tourist attractions and will double the frequency of its mass testing. Other local authorities have closed schools.

<strong>Britain’s</strong> unemployment rate fell to 3.5% in the quarter ending in August, its lowest level in nearly 50 years. Wages increased by 5.4% year on year, but continue to lag behind inflation. Separately the Bank of England widened its emergency bond-purchase intervention to counter “dysfunction” in the debt market. The scheme was introduced in response to the government’s [reckless mini-budget](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/09/23/britains-chancellor-offers-up-a-reckless-budget-fiscally-and-politically).

<strong>Iran’s </strong>security forces stepped up their violent suppression of [anti-government protests](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/29/irans-tired-regime-is-living-on-borrowed-time) that have swept the country following the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman, in the custody of the [morality police](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/26/who-are-irans-hated-morality-police). At least 185 people have been killed in clashes since mid-September. Fierce fighting between protesters and riot police was reported in Kurdish cities on Monday.

<strong>Coinbase </strong>said it had received approval from <strong>Singapore’s</strong> central bank to provide cryptocurrency services there. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange called it a “significant milestone”. Singapore wants to become a [global hub](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/29/the-battle-between-asias-financial-centres-is-heating-up) for digital assets, but its reputation has been hit by collapses and scandals at crypto-firms in the city in recent months.

Prayuth Chan-ocha, <strong>Thailand’s</strong> [prime minister](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/08/25/thailands-constitutional-court-suspends-the-prime-minister), ordered stricter gun controls and a crackdown on drug use after a mass killing at a daycare centre. Thirty-six people, mostly children, were killed in a rampage by a former policeman on October 6th. Mr Prayuth told officials to revoke gun licences from those who behaved in a way that “threatens society”.

<strong>Rivian</strong>, a maker of electric trucks, saw its shares slide by about 9% after it recalled almost all of the 13,000 of its vehicles on the road over a potential fault. The startup had the [biggest IPO of 2021](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/09/02/an-electric-vehicle-startup-aims-for-a-stellar-valuation) and nearly 100,000 people have placed orders. But supply-chain woes have slowed production; the new glitch will not help.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>13%, the average dip in earnings per share around recessions since the second world war, according to Goldman Sachs. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/10/09/have-profits-peaked-at-american-businesses).

## Russia doubles down in Ukraine

The G7, a club of rich democracies, will hold an emergency meeting on Tuesday with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. The hastily convened session is in response to Russia’s [missile attack](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/10/russia-launches-a-wave-of-missiles-across-ukraine) on civilian infrastructure and cities in Ukraine on Monday which killed at least 14 people and injured almost 100 more. The European Union said that such attacks constitute war crimes. The G7 will consider what further pressure can be applied to Russia to stop its assault.

Monday’s missiles were [retaliation](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/10/08/ukraine-braces-for-retaliation-after-an-attack-on-the-bridge-from-crimea-to-russia) for an attack on a bridge linking Crimea with Russia. But many worry that the bloodshed heralds a new chapter in an already cruel war. It appears to be a statement of intent from President Vladimir Putin and Sergei Surovikin, the general appointed on Saturday as overall Russian commander of the war. General Surovikin has a well-earned reputation for brutality and ruthlessness. One Ukrainian official says he has studied the general’s involvement in Afghanistan, two Chechen wars and Russia’s air war in Syria and had come to a grim conclusion: “He’s a butcher.”

## Meta’s metaverse conference

Nearly a year has passed since the company once known as Facebook renamed itself Meta. The rebranding was meant to signal the firm’s multi-billion-dollar, multi-year shift in focus towards the [“metaverse”](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/05/11/what-is-the-metaverse), a loose [term](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/07/27/in-the-metaverse-matthew-ball-explains-where-the-idea-came-from) envisioning an immersive, virtual-reality driven internet. The [huge investment](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/02/04/metamorphosis-facebook-and-big-tech-competition), together with flagging revenues in Meta’s core social-networking businesses, which include Instagram and WhatsApp as well as Facebook, have sent profits and shares tumbling. 

Does the firm have anything to show yet for its big bet? Investors and consumers will find out on Tuesday at Meta Connect, where progress on Meta’s virtual- and augmented-reality technologies will be revealed. These are likely to include an upgraded and pricier version of the Quest virtual-reality headset. Meta is also expected to unveil improvements to Horizon, a virtual-reality social network released last year for Quest users. Screenshots from Horizon of a cartoonish, poorly rendered version of Mark Zuckerberg, the company&#x27;s founder, became a meme this summer.

## Japan reopens to foreign tourists

More than two years of [pandemic-induced isolation](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/07/what-pandemic-border-closures-say-about-japans-view-of-outsiders) have ended in Japan. From Tuesday travellers from dozens of countries will be able to enter without visas and move around without government-approved guides. 

Japan’s government hopes tourists will help reinvigorate a flagging economy. Some 32m foreigners visited Japan in 2019; inbound tourism spending amounted to nearly ¥5trn ($34bn today). The country had planned for 40m arrivals in 2020, with the summer Olympics in Tokyo. Instead, just 4m entered; last year the number dipped to below 250,000.

The yen being at its weakest level against the dollar in nearly 25 years may inspire shopping sprees. Airlines are increasing flights to Japan. But one lucrative group will not be back just yet. In 2019 Chinese tourists accounted for 28% of arrivals and 37% of tourist spending. But their government is still restricting travel abroad. Without them, Japan’s tourism industry may yet take years to recover.

## The fattest bears in Alaska

Fat Bear Tuesday marks the climax of [Fat Bear Week](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/10/04/alaskas-fat-bear-week-proves-conservation-can-be-joyful), a contest run by Katmai National Park in southern Alaska to identify the brown bear who gains the most weight while preparing for hibernation. Fans share before and after photos of the bears, taken from webcams, and then vote. The final round, to crown a winner, will be between 747, a male nicknamed “Bear Force One”, and 901, a young female. 

The contest, which began in 2014, serves a purpose besides ogling champion chunksters. The park’s webcams bring [Alaska’s wilderness](https://www.economist.com/essay/2022/09/08/the-alaskan-wilderness-reveals-the-past-and-the-future) to people who otherwise may never see it. It also draws attention to conservation. Katmai’s 2,200 bears are so rotund because they feed from a healthy salmon run, untouched by overfishing and [dam construction](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/07/08/in-the-pacific-north-west-hydroelectric-dams-are-being-removed). Park rangers argue the joyful contest has gone viral because it helps dispel gloomy feelings about habitat loss and climate change. May the fattest bear win.

## Damien Hirst burns his art

On Tuesday morning [Damien Hirst](https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2017/04/15/damien-hirsts-new-art-is-exquisitely-crafted), a British artist, will begin burning a collection of paintings valued at about $10m as the finale of “The Currency”, his project pitting physical art against [non-fungible tokens](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/10/12/what-is-an-nft).

Last year 10,000 of Mr Hirst’s paintings featuring colourful enamel spots, made in 2016, were made into digital files, known as NFTs. Each NFT was sold for $2,000 but buyers were later given the choice between keeping the NFT or swapping it for the painting. Unwanted paintings are now being burned and rejected NFTs deleted.  
  
 In all 9,000 works were sold to the public: 5,149 buyers chose paintings while 3,851 wanted the NFTs. (Mr Hirst kept the rest.) Fewer than 70 physical works have appeared at auction, fetching twice the price of the more than 2,000 NFTs that have been resold. If “The Currency” asks whether digital works are as valuable as tangible ones, the answer seems to be no.
