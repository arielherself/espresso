<strong>Sergei Shoigu</strong>, Russia’s defence minister, appointed a new commander, <strong>Valery Gerasimov</strong>, to lead its invasion of Ukraine. Mr Gerasimov replaces [Sergei Surovikin](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/10/13/who-is-sergei-surovikin-russias-new-commander-in-ukraine), known by the moniker “General Armageddon”, who lasted only three months and is now Mr Gerasimov’s deputy. Fighting continues in Soledar, a town in eastern Ukraine which the Wagner Group, a militia working for Russia, falsely claimed to have taken. Separately, Russia and Ukraine agreed to swap more than 40 prisoners from each side.

<strong>FTX </strong>said it had [recovered more than $5bn](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/01/10/the-hunt-for-ftxs-missing-riches) in liquid assets, up from roughly $1bn that it had located as of December. The bankrupt crypto exchange also holds illiquid investments valued at $4.6bn. At a bankruptcy hearing in Delaware the firm’s lawyer said there was still a “shortfall” in what is owed to creditors, but its size would depend on the pool of claims.

A <strong>suicide-bomb</strong> attack outside <strong>Afghanistan’s </strong>foreign ministry in Kabul, the capital, killed at least five people, according to police. The Taliban’s information office put the death toll at 20. The attacker reportedly tried but failed to enter the building, which is located near some foreign embassies. Afghanistan has actually recorded [fewer violent attacks](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/08/15/violence-in-afghanistan-has-dropped-under-the-taliban) against civilians—but greater repression—since the Taliban reclaimed power in 2021. 

<strong>George Santos</strong>, an American congressman and serial fabricator, rejected calls for him to resign from Republican officials in his <strong>New York </strong>district. Mr Santos, who was elected to the House of Representatives in November, faces investigations into his finances, background, and campaign spending after much of his CV was revealed to be false. Republican leaders in Washington have largely stayed mum.

The <strong>Egyptian pound </strong>fell to a record low against the dollar as the country devalued its currency for the third time in ten months. As part of a $3bn bail-out from the <strong>IMF </strong>in October, Egypt agreed to stop using foreign reserves to prop up the pound’s value. Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine led foreign investors [to flee risky assets](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/11/03/the-growing-popularity-of-a-strange-form-of-debt-diplomacy), putting downward pressure on the Egyptian currency.

<strong>Britain’s</strong> foreign minister demanded that <strong>Iran</strong> halt its planned execution of a British-Iranian man convicted of spying for MI6. Alireza Akbari served as Iran’s deputy-defence minister about two decades ago, then settled in Britain and obtained citizenship there. His family avoided publicising his plight for fear of upsetting his legal case, but now it says that his execution appears imminent.

<strong>Domestic flights</strong> are gradually resuming in America hours after the Federal Aviation Administration cancelled [departures](https://www.economist.com/business/2023/01/05/how-to-avoid-flight-chaos) due to a fault in its computer systems. The FAA said that its “Notice to Air Missions” system, which alerts pilots to potential hazards, had failed. The agency suggested it was still looking into the cause of the problem. 

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> At least 3,000, the number of people kidnapped last year in Nigeria, an almost 30-fold increase on 2016. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2023/01/09/after-eight-dismal-years-nigeria-prepares-to-replace-president-buhari).

## FTX goes back to bankruptcy court

John Ray, the current head of FTX, the [now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/11/17/the-failure-of-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried-will-leave-deep-scars) founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, will return to Delaware on Wednesday for the next phase of bankruptcy proceedings. FTX, along with many companies that made up Mr Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire, was put into bankruptcy on November 11th after failing to meet withdrawal requests from the exchange by customers. Some 1m creditors have since filed claims against the firm for assets worth as much as $8bn.

The bankruptcy proceedings are occurring in tandem with criminal proceedings against Mr Bankman-Fried. On January 3rd he [pleaded not guilty](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/01/03/sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty) to several criminal-fraud charges. On Monday he was dealt a blow when it was revealed that Nishad Singh, the former chief engineer at FTX, is seeking a plea deal. Caroline Ellison, the boss of Alameda, a hedge fund that Mr Bankman-Fried founded and majority owned, and Gary Wang, the co-founder of FTX, have already struck plea deals with the prosecution in exchange for information. Mr Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial will commence in October.

## Several types of turmoil in Brazil

This week prosecutors in Brazil will investigate how thousands of supporters of Jair Bolsonaro, the right-wing former president, were able [to storm](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2023/01/09/supporters-of-jair-bolsonaro-mount-an-insurrection-in-brazil) Congress, the presidential palace and the Supreme Court on Sunday. Prosecutors are likely to focus on how the rampage was financed and why security forces in Brasília, the capital, failed to stop it. Protesters believe that an election in October—won by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a leftist former president—was stolen. 

Shared outrage might help Lula enact much-needed economic reforms. But the boost to that agenda, if any, will be brief. The economy is weak. Just how weak may become more apparent on Wednesday, when November’s retail sales will be reported. The central bank expects real economic growth of just 1% in 2023. It is being held back by rising interest rates and by concerns about the [fiscal crunch Brazil is facing](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/12/31/brazils-new-president-faces-a-fiscal-crunch-and-a-fickle-congress). Lula’s government has promised a new fiscal framework to reduce the budget deficit and a tax reform. 

## Australia may avoid a recession yet again

After a temporary reprieve, inflation in Australia is accelerating again. Figures released on Wednesday showed that the annual inflation rate hit 7.3% in November 2022, up from 6.9% in October and matching the 32-year high reached in September. The Reserve Bank of Australia predicts that inflation will peak at around 8%, before easing throughout 2023.

Even so, the lucky country is living up to its nickname. Though painful, its inflation rate is well below [the average for members of the OECD](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/21/2022-has-been-a-year-of-brutal-inflation), a club of mostly rich countries. Its economy is bearing up despite several rounds of monetary tightening. Central bankers predict that it will grow by about 1.5% this year in real terms, even as many other economies tip into recession. That is thanks, in part, to its energy riches and to immigration rebounding after the pandemic. Australia went almost 30 years without a recession before the pandemic triggered a brief one in 2020. It will probably dodge the coming global downturn, too.

## Grim times at Goldman Sachs

The mood is gloomy at Goldman Sachs. The bank is expected to sack up to 3,200 employees on Wednesday—its biggest round of lay-offs since the financial crash in 2008. Those who keep their jobs will see smaller bonuses later this month. Even the premium workplace coffee is reportedly no longer free.

Higher interest rates and fears of recession are slowing down dealmaking on Wall Street. Goldman’s cuts will hit its investment-banking and trading units particularly hard. Rival investment banks have shed staff, too. But Goldman’s plight is more acute because of Marcus, a [consumer-lending venture](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/10/18/goldman-sachss-disastrous-main-street-gamble) that has lost money since its launch in 2016. In October Marcus was reshuffled for the third time in almost as many years to help downplay some of its losses. Goldman is also having to cut because it had grown fat. David Solomon, its chief executive since 2018, hired aggressively but then did not carry out the usual annual purge of “underperformers” during the pandemic. Now Goldman seems to be making up for lost time.

## A new telling of Shamima Begum’s story

Before Islamic State was defeated in 2019, more than 41,000 foreigners travelled to Syria and Iraq to join its self-proclaimed caliphate. Shamima Begum, a British schoolgirl, was one of them. Aged 15, she became a jihadist’s child-bride. Britain revoked her citizenship four years later in 2019, leaving her stateless. Ms Begum’s lawyers are challenging this ruling, arguing that she was trafficked by IS.

“I’m not a monster: the Shamima Begum story”, a podcast released on Wednesday on BBC Sounds, scrutinises the teenager’s choices. After more than a year of extensive interviews with Ms Begum—who is now living in a Syrian refugee camp—Joshua Baker, an investigative journalist, re-enacts her journey to Syria in an attempt to find out what really happened, and how to interpret her story. Is she a vulnerable teenager who was groomed by jihadists, or a national-security threat, culpable for her actions? “You do accept that you did join a terrorist group?” asks Mr Baker in the first episode. “Yes”, she says. “I did.”
