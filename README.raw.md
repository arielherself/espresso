World leaders are gathering for the <strong>Munich Security Conference</strong>, an annual diplomatic event, which kicks off with speeches by [Dmytro Kuleba](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/03/23/an-interview-with-dmytro-kuleba), Ukraine’s foreign minister, Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, and the host, Olaf Scholz. <strong>Ukraine</strong> is top of the agenda, as <strong>Russian</strong> forces target [Bakhmut](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/12/06/russia-is-hurling-troops-at-the-tiny-ukrainian-town-of-bakhmut) in the east of the country. On Thursday Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, told the BBC that he would not concede land to Russia if the countries were to broker a peace deal.

<strong>President Joe Biden</strong> said he would speak with <strong>Xi Jinping</strong>, China’s president, about the suspected [Chinese spy balloon](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/02/09/cold-war-lessons-from-chinas-spy-balloon) that was shot down by an American fighter jet earlier this month. Mr Biden said America was “not looking for a new cold war”. Separately Michael Chase, the Pentagon’s top China official, plans to visit Taiwan, according to the <em>Financial Times</em>. Mr Chase would be the first senior American defence official to visit Taiwan since 2019.

Michael Regan, head of America’s [Environmental Protection Agency](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/30/the-supreme-court-throttles-joe-bidens-climate-agenda), visited East Palestine, <strong>Ohio</strong>, where a train derailment on February 3rd caused a toxic chemical leak, forcing residents to leave their homes. Mr Regan said that <strong>America’s </strong>government would hold Norfolk Southern, the train company involved, “accountable”. Residents were advised to drink bottled water until natural supplies are free from contamination.

Shares at <strong>China Renaissance</strong>, an investment bank, dropped by as much as 50% on Friday after <strong>Bao Fan</strong>, its chairman, became uncontactable. His disappearance is believed to be linked to a government investigation. As the Chinese government’s anti-corruption campaign continues, several [billionaire financiers](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/07/07/what-a-tycoons-trial-says-about-the-rot-in-chinas-financial-system) have gone missing.

David Smith, a former security guard at the <strong>British</strong> embassy in Berlin, was sentenced to more than 13 years in prison for [spying](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-reads/2022/12/21/what-to-read-to-understand-intelligence-and-espionage) for <strong>Russia</strong>. Mr Smith passed several sensitive documents, and photos of embassy staff, to Russian authorities. Britain’s Crown Prosecution Service said that Mr Smith “could have threatened national security”. 

More than 2,000 flights were cancelled after workers at seven airports in <strong>Germany </strong>began a 24-hour [strike](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/11/24/germanys-biggest-trade-union-strikes-a-deal-on-pay). Around 300,000 passengers will be affected. Members of Verdi, a trade union, are seeking a 10.5% pay increase. The timing of the walkout is painful: it follows Lufthansa grounding its entire fleet over an IT outage on Wednesday and coincides with the Munich Security Conference.

<strong>Portugal</strong> will stop offering “golden visas” to foreign property buyers, in an attempt at tackling the country’s lack of affordable housing. [The scheme](https://www.economist.com/europe/2014/11/20/buying-their-way-in) granted residence permits to non-EU nationals who invested in Portugal. It raised €6.8bn ($7.3bn), much of which came from Chinese real-estate investors. But locals complained that it sent property prices soaring. Ireland scrapped a similar scheme earlier this week.

## A geopolitical gathering in Munich

It is not just the year-old Russian war on Ukraine that has made for a tense run-up to the Munich Security Conference—an annual jamboree for diplomats, soldiers and security wonks—opening on Friday. The logistically stalwart host has faced local hitches: a strike looks set to paralyse airports, including Munich’s. On Wednesday an accidental severing of a fibre-optic cable grounded Germany’s main airline, Lufthansa.

If the 500-odd participants, among them presidents, prime ministers and more than 80 defence and foreign ministers, arrive as planned, their three-day huddle will be busy. Russia’s looming offensive tops concerns as [Western allies of Ukraine](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2022/12/01/will-germany-succeed-in-transforming-its-foreign-policy) struggle to rally fence-sitters in Asia, Latin America and Africa. Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, and Wang Yi, China’s top diplomat, are rumoured to be planning to meet in Munich amid tensions over [Chinese spy balloons](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/02/09/cold-war-lessons-from-chinas-spy-balloon) in North America. But one [veteran participant](http://espresso.economist.com/90915208c601cc8c86ad01250ee90c12)⁠—Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov⁠—has pointedly not been invited.

## China’s aggressive overseas lending

A clutch of heavily indebted poor countries meet creditors virtually on Friday at a meeting convened by the IMF, the World Bank and India, the current president of the G20. Their leaders hope to iron out disagreements over debt restructuring that have kept a number of low- and middle-income economies in [costly limbo](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/07/20/the-53-fragile-emerging-economies).

The shocks of the past few years have left many poorer places, like [Sri Lanka](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/28/what-it-will-take-to-fix-sri-lankas-economy) and [Ethiopia](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/04/30/debt-repayment-costs-are-rising-fast-for-many-african-countries), with unpayable debt burdens. In the past such economies mostly borrowed from rich countries or development agencies like the World Bank. As members of the Paris Club, they often co-operated on debt restructuring.

But in recent years China has become the emerging world’s biggest [sovereign lender](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/08/24/faced-with-an-overseas-debt-crisis-will-china-change-its-ways). Its reluctance to accept losses, or follow normal Paris Club practice, has prevented debt-ensnared economies from returning to fiscal health. China’s participation in Friday’s talks will have rich and poor countries alike hoping for a resolution.

## The fashion industry in flux

China’s reopening is a boon—the country is expected to account for half of the growth in the luxury sector this year. But off the runway, the industry is undergoing [rapid change](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/10/06/fashion-gets-a-modern-makeover).

A boom in e-commerce during the pandemic was followed by a mass return of customers to shops, forcing companies to invest in both online and offline channels. Brands like [Shein](https://www.economist.com/business/shein-exemplifies-a-new-style-of-chinese-multinational/21805217), a Chinese online retailer, are using artificial intelligence to shorten turnaround times for delivering new items in response to trends. The industry is embracing more influencers and celebrities. This week Pharrell Williams, a music producer, was appointed Louis Vuitton’s creative director for menswear.

But with change comes uncertainty—aggravated by inflationary pressure, soaring energy prices and economic volatility. Shoppers will be more selective. Mid-sized mass-market brands, in particular, must find new ways to stand out.

## A glimmer of hope over Kosovo

Friday marks the 15th anniversary of Kosovo’s declaration of independence from Serbia. But Serbia (as well as Russia, China and five European Union members) still refuses to recognise Kosovo’s statehood. Its government exerts influence on Kosovo’s politics through a small Serbian minority in an otherwise overwhelmingly ethnically Albanian country. Tensions regularly [flare](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/12/20/kosovo-and-serbia-are-on-the-verge-of-conflict-again).

The two countries have conducted EU-brokered negotiations for more than a decade with no conclusion. But Western countries are now pressing hard for a deal; they fear that a violent Balkan flare-up would distract from the war in Ukraine and serve the interests of the Kremlin. A trade-off appears to be in the offing: Serbia would treat Kosovo as a state for practical purposes (without formally recognising it) and Kosovars would grant autonomy to Serb-dominated municipalities.

But not everyone is happy. Aleksandar Vucic, Serbia’s president, says that the EU could halt his country’s bid for membership if he does not compromise over Kosovo. But the chances of a resolution to the dispute—if still small—seem better than ever.

## Will Qatar buy Man Utd?

The English Premier League is [booming](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/01/19/football-clubs-revenues-rebound-from-covid-especially-in-england). Its football clubs are surging ahead, at least financially, of their European counterparts. No wonder plutocrats and petrostates are prowling. Jahm Najafi, an Iranian-American billionaire, is reportedly interested in buying Tottenham Hotspur for $3.75bn. On Friday, however, Qatar, through a state-backed investment fund, is expected to bid a far higher amount for Manchester United.

Britain’s best-supported club is up for sale after its much-loathed American owners, the Glazer family, said they were willing to “explore strategic alternatives”. Friday is the soft deadline for bids. Several parties are interested, but it is the prospect of Qatari ownership that is dividing United fans. Some hope that the emirs could return the club to glory. Others are left queasy by the prospect of the controversial Gulf state using the club for a bit of “sportswashing”, much like when it hosted last year’s [World Cup](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/10/the-world-cup-is-tarnished-should-fans-enjoy-it-anyway).
