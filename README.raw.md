Russia launched more than 70 missiles on Ukraine in its second mass strike in a matter of days, damaging energy infrastructure in Kyiv, the capital, and elsewhere, killing two. Kherson, in southern Ukraine, was left without power and Kharkiv, in the east, saw its electricity, heating and water supplies cut. Meanwhile, General Valery Zaluzhny, the head of Ukraine’s armed forces, told The Economist that the Russians are preparing for a major Russian offensive in the next few months, including “another go at Kyiv”.

A congressional committee charged with investigating the Capitol riot of January 6th 2021 will reportedly recommend that former-president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> be charged with insurrection. The Department of Justice, who would handle such a prosecution and is conducting its own probe, is not obliged to follow the suggestion. Mr Trump denies any wrongdoing; a spokesperson called [the proceedings](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/10/congresss-capitol-riot-hearing-confirms-donald-trumps-complicity) “show trials”.

<strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> will reportedly [lay off several thousand employees](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/12/04/is-a-white-collar-recession-looming) and slash bonuses as it retreats from its planned consumer business. Semafor, a news site, reported that the firm could shed 8% of its staff, a more substantial cut than rival banks. Its consumer-facing unit, Marcus, is not profitable, and Goldman’s share price has fallen by nearly a tenth this year.

<strong>Binance</strong>, the world’s largest <strong>crypto</strong> exchange, said it had processed $6bn in net withdrawals between Monday and Wednesday, as [FTX’s collapse](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/12/13/the-game-is-up-for-sam-bankman-fried) continued to unnerve crypto investors. On Friday Mazars Group, an accounting firm, said it would stop producing “proof of reserve” reports—a much skimpier version of a standard audit—for Binance. Binance said it was searching for another firm to do so, to provide “transparency” and reassure customers.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

The <strong>European Commission</strong> threatened <strong>Twitter</strong> with sanctions if “red lines” were crossed. The warning came after the social-media platform banned some journalists who had written about its [new owner](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/12/01/elon-musk-is-showing-what-a-waste-of-time-twitter-can-be), Elon Musk. <strong>Vera Jourova</strong>, the commissioner for values and transparency, called the suspensions “worrying” and hinted that they could violate the EU’s Digital Services Act—a draft law targeting big tech that could come into force next year.

<strong>Peru’s</strong> congress rejected legislation by the new president to bring forward elections by more than two years, to December 2023—a proposal intended to quell protests over the ouster of [Pedro Castillo](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/12/07/after-a-bungled-coup-attempt-perus-president-falls), the president. At least 20 people have died in the clashes; two cabinet ministers have resigned. About 5,000 tourists have been stranded in Cusco, near Machu Picchu, after protesters stormed the airport.

The Biden administration said it would buy 3m barrels of <strong>oil</strong> in February to replenish <strong>America’s</strong> strategic reserves, after overseeing the largest drawdown from the stockpile since the mid-1980s. The move is intended to [spur production by domestic firms](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/03/28/will-americas-shale-producers-make-up-for-untradeable-russian-oil), who alone are eligible to supply the stuff. In March the administration sold 180m barrels from the stockpile.

<strong>Fact of the day: </strong>12,000, the number of new regulations introduced by the American government in 2021, a rise on recent years. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/12/14/why-are-the-rich-worlds-politicians-giving-up-on-economic-growth).

## Beefing up Japan’s defences

Japan’s security policy took a leap forward on Friday, when the government released long-awaited [revisions](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/09/13/war-in-ukraine-has-bolstered-japans-support-for-a-stronger-army) to its national security strategy. It codified plans to raise defence spending to 2% of GDP by 2027, up from around 1% today. At current levels, that would make Japan the world’s third-largest defence spender in absolute terms. The government also plans to acquire long-range missiles that would allow it to strike targets in enemy territory. Both moves represent breaks in precedent in a country where pacifism has been dominant since the end of the second world war. 

Big questions remain. One is what exactly the new money will be spent on. The other is where it will come from. Yet, strikingly, there has been no major domestic opposition to the government’s proposals. A combination of China’s aggressive posture, North Korea’s increasingly brazen missile programme and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have convinced the Japanese that they can no longer afford to skimp on security.

## The ANC’s big meeting in Johannesburg

When the African National Congress begins its national conference on Friday, the arena will reverberate with old songs about fighting apartheid. Indeed, there is more to celebrate in the past of [South Africa’s ruling party](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/12/08/cyril-ramaphosa-is-contesting-efforts-to-oust-him) than in its present—or future. After 28 years of ANC governments South Africans are increasingly fed up with the party, which is expected to lose its majority at the next general election in 2024. 

At the conference the party will choose its leadership to fight that election. Despite a recent [corruption scandal](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/06/23/allegations-of-impropriety-weaken-south-africas-president) Cyril Ramaphosa, president of both party and country, is expected to hold on to power. His supporters say that if he can muster enough allies in top party positions, he will finally be able to pursue economic reforms and clean up corruption. Yet that is naive. Not even Nelson Mandela, the ANC’s most famous leader, would be able to renew the party today. It is a machine for patronage, not for progress.

## Sweden inches towards NATO

On Friday the Riksdag, Sweden’s parliament, will discuss the country’s defence budget. Sweden [applied this year](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/05/12/sweden-is-following-finlands-lead-on-joining-nato) to join NATO alongside Finland, its Nordic neighbour, following Russia’s attack on Ukraine. Sweden had planned to reach the alliance’s defence-spending target of 2% of GDP by 2028, but may now bring that target forward by two years.

But the pair’s NATO applications have been held up by Hungary and Turkey, two other members of the alliance. On Tuesday, after the EU agreed to let it access billions in aid, Hungary lifted its veto and confirmed its parliament would debate Swedish and Finnish accession in February. Meanwhile, Sweden has been courting Turkey. In September it lifted an informal ban on selling military equipment to the country. And reports emerged this month that Sweden’s government has deported people to Turkey suspected of ties to the [PKK](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/06/28/what-is-the-pkk), a Kurdish rebel group that has long been a thorn in the side of Turkish leaders. It remains unclear if the concessions will do the trick. 

## Life is still too dangerous for Indian women

Friday marks ten years to the day since Jyoti Singh, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student, was raped and mutilated by a group of men on a bus in Delhi. She later died of her injuries. 

A decade on, [not enough has changed](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/11/29/what-two-crimes-reveal-about-violence-against-indian-women). In May Shraddha Walkar, a call-centre worker, vanished in Delhi. She had previously told police that her partner, with whom she lived, beat and threatened to dismember her. He confessed to ultimately doing so last month. Most violence against Indian women happens at home: in a survey 30% of married or previously married women said they had been subject to domestic abuse.

Jyoti Singh’s case did prompt change. Several new laws make the prosecution of sexual-assault cases easier, the Supreme Court strengthened women’s rights in several areas and the share of victims who reported sex crimes rose somewhat. But much more work is needed. Half of Indians still say it is acceptable for husbands to beat their wives. Until [social attitudes](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2019/02/05/how-indias-men-can-learn-to-treat-women-better) change, women will remain in peril.

## The sequel to “Avatar” finally arrives

On Friday the long-awaited sequel to “Avatar”, a science-fiction blockbuster released in 2009, will finally hit the screens. Its director, James Cameron, has an impressive record. The first “Avatar” is the highest-grossing film ever made; another of Mr Cameron’s efforts, “[Titanic](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/23/twenty-five-years-on-titanic-feels-like-a-prophecy)”, is in third place. But “Avatar: The Way of Water” may struggle to make such a big splash. 

The sequel continues the adventures of Jake Sully (played by Sam Worthington), an American Marine whose mind has been zapped into a cloned alien body. He now defends his Edenic adopted home world, Pandora, from invading human colonists. The computer-generated imagery is spectacular. Yet the action doesn’t merit the film’s running time of over three hours. The protagonist spends half of that on a tropical island, bonding with local sea creatures. Mr Cameron may be saving his best story ideas for later: three more instalments of the franchise are due before 2030. Fans must hope they are worth the wait.
