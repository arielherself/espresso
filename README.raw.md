<strong>Democrats</strong> in <strong>America’s Senate</strong> passed their signature [climate, tax and health-care legislation](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/07/28/democratic-hopes-for-a-big-spending-bill-are-revived) along party lines, after two of their wayward partisans were brought into line. The House is expected to pass it later this week and send it to President Joe Biden’s desk. The law would reduce emissions, raise corporate taxes and enable the government to [negotiate prescription drug prices](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/11/20/democrats-have-a-plan-to-lower-drug-costs-without-hurting-innovation) on behalf of over-65s.

A ceasefire between <strong>Israel</strong> and <strong>Palestinian militants</strong> in the <strong>Gaza Strip</strong>, brokered by Egypt, took effect on Sunday evening. [Israeli air strikes on the enclave](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/07/the-attack-on-gaza-may-bolster-israels-prime-minister), which began on Friday, have killed 43 people, according to the Palestinian health ministry. At least two leaders of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a militant group, are among the dead. Retaliatory rockets fired from Gaza into Israel activated air sirens in Jerusalem. 

<strong>China</strong> announced new military drills around <strong>Taiwan</strong> on Monday, contrary to its previous statement that live-fire exercises would conclude on Sunday. China also announced fresh drills, to last until August 15th, in the Yellow Sea, which separates it from the Korean peninsula. The People’s Liberation Army had already conducted its largest-ever [co-ordinated exercises](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/08/04/china-sends-missiles-flying-over-taiwan) in the Taiwan Strait, in reaction to a visit from an American delegation. Su Tseng-chang, Taiwan’s prime minister, said his island would “never bow to pressure”.

<strong>SoftBank</strong>, the Japanese investment giant led by [Masayoshi Son](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/06/17/hard-truths-about-softbank), posted a record-breaking quarterly loss worth $23.4bn. The [global selloff](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/05/16/after-a-bruising-year-softbank-braces-for-more-pain) in <strong>tech stocks</strong> did most of the damage: Mr Son’s Vision Fund unit spilled more than $17bn of the red ink. Flagging enthusiasm for startups and the failure to sell Arm, a British chipmaker, have been darkening SoftBank’s horizons for months.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

<strong>Gustavo Petro</strong>, a former Marxist guerrilla and anti-corruption crusader, was sworn in as <strong>Colombia’s</strong> [first left-wing president](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/08/06/who-is-gustavo-petro), pledging to prohibit new licences for oil and gas exploration. He also called for an “international convention” to replace the “war on drugs”—a decades-long, American-led policy of using the army and police to batter criminal organisations, which he said had cost a million Latin American lives.

Volodymyr Zelensky, <strong>Ukraine’s</strong> president, accused <strong>Russia</strong> of engaging in “nuclear terror” by shelling the Zaporizhzhia [nuclear power plant](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/03/04/europes-largest-nuclear-plant-shuts-down-after-a-russian-attack) in southern Ukraine. Russian forces said the artillery fire had in fact come from Ukrainian soldiers. The shelling damaged three radiation sensors and wounded one worker, according to Ukraine’s nuclear-power operator. The UN’s nuclear watchdog implored both sides to give international monitors access to the site.

<strong>Italy’s</strong> centrist Azione party left an election alliance with the Democratic Party that had been forged just last week. The coalition that remains will contest a [general election](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/28/italys-next-government-may-be-more-nationalist-than-europe-likes) on September 25th, which was called after Mario Draghi, the prime minister, resigned last month. Polls look favourable for right-wing parties, with the far-right Brothers of Italy set to become the largest single party.

## America’s new tone on Africa

When Antony Blinken begins a three-country tour of Africa on Monday, America’s secretary of state will strike a more emollient tone than his predecessors. The Trump administration was obsessed with telling African states to resist China’s supposedly nefarious ways. African leaders saw that as patronising and impractical. [China is Africa’s largest trading partner](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2022/05/20/how-chinese-firms-have-changed-africa) and bilateral creditor. 

Mr Blinken will [recast](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2022/05/20/countering-china-in-africa) America’s approach, saying that African countries have the right to follow their own paths to development. But he will also argue, in a nod to the roughly half of African countries that did not vote at the UN to [condemn](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/04/04/who-are-russias-supporters) Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, that America is the most reliable partner for those journeys, whether they involve dealing with [debt crises](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/04/30/debt-repayment-costs-are-rising-fast-for-many-african-countries) or climate change. African leaders will appreciate this more nuanced message—but wonder where the beef is. Many African economies are in deep trouble and need support for debt relief, generous IMF programmes and money from climate-finance schemes. Mr Blinken’s words are one thing; America’s deeds, quite another.

## Hard times ahead for SoftBank

SoftBank Group reported a loss of 3.2trn yen ($23.4bn) in the second quarter. The unprecedented result adds more misery to what is already an annus horribilis for the Japanese investment giant. After an eventually[ profitable pandemic](https://www.economist.com/business/2020/10/15/what-softbanks-masa-does-next), the firm suffered what was then its[ largest-ever losses](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/05/16/after-a-bruising-year-softbank-braces-for-more-pain) in the first quarter of 2022. These ones are worse.

Most of the newly announced pain comes from SoftBank’s so-called Vision Funds, which make up 38% of its holdings. The funds—which hold both publicly listed tech firms and smaller private companies aiming for rapid growth—posted a loss of 2.3trn yen in the second quarter. Tech stocks have stumbled in recent months as interest rates have risen, causing nosebleed-level valuations to dive. The NASDAQ 100, an index of the best-performing tech companies, lost 22% in the quarter to the end of June, its worst showing since the financial crisis of 2008. 

## America’s abortion wars rage on

Legal challenges to abortion restrictions in America will continue on Monday, when a court in Georgia hears a motion to temporarily halt the state’s ban on abortions after six weeks. In July the American Civil Liberties Union and local pro-choice groups sued the state after a federal court upheld the ban. The plaintiffs argue abortion is protected by a right to privacy in Georgia’s constitution.

Since June, when the Supreme Court [overturned <em>Roe v Wade</em>](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/24/the-supreme-court-erases-the-constitutional-right-to-abortion) and handed abortion policy back to individual states, 14 of them have, in effect, banned the procedure. Several others have imposed severe restrictions. Since then, legal challenges to abortion laws have arisen in at least a dozen states. The federal Justice department has sued Idaho, arguing that under its new rules pregnant women may be denied necessary medical care. But last week Kansans voted overwhelmingly [to keep](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/03/kansans-vote-to-keep-the-right-to-abortion) their right to abortion. With the issue further dividing America ahead of the mid-term elections in November, the battle is far from over.

## A boost for BioNTech

Since listing in 2019 BioNTech has rapidly become one of Europe’s biggest biotech companies. With assets worth €19bn ($19.4bn), the German firm is catching up with pharmaceutical giants such as AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline. Despite a downturn across the industry, BioNTech is expected to report another set of impressive results on Monday.  
  
 The firm’s success is fuelled by sales of the [highly effective](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/07/13/which-covid-19-vaccine-saved-the-most-lives-in-2021) [mRNA](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/03/27/covid-19-vaccines-have-alerted-the-world-to-the-power-of-rna-therapies) coronavirus vaccine it developed with Pfizer in 2020. The jab recently became the only covid-19 vaccine fully approved for adolescents in America. The American government has also ordered 105m [booster](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2021/09/14/booster-shots-are-they-necessary) doses of a version of the BioNtech vaccine that targets the Omicron variant.

Other biotech firms are battling a funding drought, falling valuations and dwindling reserves of capital. But BioNTech’s vaccine profits allow it the freedom to invest in ambitious experiments. The company has long studied cancer and hopes to use mRNA technology to transform the treatment of the disease. But investors expecting another overnight success should beware—the oncology market is crowded, and agonisingly slow.

## The failings of hazing

The rites of initiation practised by [American university fraternities](https://www.economist.com/united-states/1997/10/02/raise-a-fond-last-glass-to-dionysus) have long been a source of intrigue for anthropologists. Their pet theory is that these “hazing” traditions, which usually involve humiliating or physically tormenting inductees, help build group solidarity. But studying them is difficult, given that they tend to be shrouded in secrecy. Now <em>Evolution and Human Behavior</em>, a journal, has published one of the most in-depth studies on hazing to date. 

Between 2012 and 2014 the study tracked six groups of inductees, known as “pledges”, who were hoping to enter a fraternity chapter (which remained anonymous). The researchers interviewed individuals as they undertook a ten-week induction process, including unnamed hazing rituals. The results suggested that anthropologists were wrong: hazing does not, in fact, improve group solidarity. In recent years concerns about the [dangerous](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2017/10/13/hazing-deaths-on-american-college-campuses-remain-far-too-common) practice have compelled universities to crack down on fraternities. If its ineffectiveness had been proven sooner, hazing would have been exposed for what it is—a cruel, pointless and often dangerous practice.
