The World Health Organisation declared <strong>monkeypox</strong> [a global health emergency](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/06/23/is-monkeypox-an-international-public-health-emergency). More than 16,000 cases of the viral illness have been reported this year. The alert, the WHO’s highest, was last used in January 2020 with SARS-CoV-2. It is meant to spur countries to establish a spur countries to mount a co-ordinated, international response. Although monkeypox [rarely kills healthy adults](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2022/05/25/the-spread-of-monkeypox), it can be dangerous for children, pregnant women and immunocompromised people.

A day after <strong>Ukraine</strong> and <strong>Russia</strong> had [signed a deal](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/22/after-agreeing-to-let-ukraine-export-grain-russia-rockets-its-port) to resume grain exports from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, Russian missiles hit Odessa, the biggest of those ports. A Ukrainian foreign-ministry spokesman accused Vladimir Putin of “spitting in the face” of the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, and Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who brokered the agreement. The attack breaks the conditions of the deal and could already signal its demise.

A <strong>wildfire</strong> near <strong>California’s</strong> Yosemite National Park [spread rapidly](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2020/09/10/wildfires-will-be-more-common-in-a-warming-world) in the 24 hours since igniting on Friday afternoon. By Saturday the Oak Fire covered more than 6,500 acres (2,630 hectares), destroying 10 properties and threatening thousands more. Some 400 firefighters were deployed and 6,000 people told to evacuate the area.

<strong>Google</strong> has sacked a software engineer, Blake Lemoine, who last month shared his belief that [LaMDA](https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2022/06/09/artificial-neural-networks-are-making-strides-towards-consciousness-according-to-blaise-aguera-y-arcas), the company’s chatbot, had become “[sentient](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/06/14/could-artificial-intelligence-become-sentient)” with the <em>Washington Post</em>. He said that, without knowing better, he’d think he was talking to “a seven-year-old, eight-year-old kid that happens to know physics”. Google dismissed Mr Lemoine’s claims as unfounded and said his behaviour violated the company’s employment and data-security policies.

Listen to an abridged version of the subscriber-only briefing.

The UN’s top court ruled that a case accusing <strong>Myanmar</strong> of committing <strong>genocide</strong> against Rohingya Muslims can continue, striking down objections from the country’s ruling military junta. The International Court of Justice will now try to establish how responsible the state was for the violence that caused hundreds of thousands of [Rohingyas to flee](https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/10/09/a-rohingya-leaders-murder-highlights-rising-insecurity-in-refugee-camps). 

<strong>Cuba’s</strong> parliament announced that [the country](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/03/26/cubas-dictatorship-has-a-cultural-opposition-that-it-cant-tolerate) will hold a referendum on <strong>legalising same-sex marriage</strong> and surrogate parenthood. The National Assembly approved an update to Cuba’s family law, which would also allow same-sex couples to adopt children and strengthen legal protections for children and the elderly. The public will now vote on the matter on September 25th. 

Xinjiang, a region in the far west of <strong>China</strong>, was warned that it faced flash floods, mudslides and risks to agriculture amid forecasts of more <strong>unusually high temperatures</strong> in the coming days. Some 20% of the world’s cotton is produced in the area. Since mid-June much of China has baked under [brutal heatwaves](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/20/todays-heatwaves-are-a-warning-of-worse-to-come), which are attributed to climate change. 

<strong>Word of the week:</strong> <em>lanweilou</em>, a Chinese term for unfinished buildings. Across China people are halting mortgage payments on such homes to protest construction delays.

## The pope’s pilgrimage of penance

When Pope Francis arrives in Canada on Sunday for a five-day visit, his primary purpose will be not to preach but to do penance. He plans to apologise for the role of the Roman Catholic Church in Canada’s [residential-schools](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/07/26/what-happened-at-residential-schools-for-indigenous-children-in-north-america) system, which from the early 19th century until 1996 separated indigenous children from their families and culture.

Canada’s government forced 150,000 children into the schools, 60% of which were run by the church. They were housed in inhuman conditions, and many were sexually abused. A horrifying number died. Last year hundreds of [unmarked graves](https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2021/07/01/more-graves-are-found-at-canadian-schools-for-the-indigenous) were discovered at sites of former schools. In 2015 a truth and reconciliation commission, established in response to lawsuits brought by indigenous Canadians, said the schools were part of a programme of “cultural genocide”. 

Francis has already said sorry. In a trip that will take him to Alberta, Quebec and the Arctic territory of Nunavut, he will atone at the scene of the crimes.

## Queen of the mountains

Since 1989, when Jeannie Longo won the Tour de France Féminin for the third consecutive time, France’s premier long-distance cycling race has had no room for women. Organisers blamed a lack of money and interest. But times have changed.

As the men’s [Tour de France](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/06/30/how-to-watch-the-tour-de-france-from-afar) finishes in Paris on Sunday, a new competition, the Tour de France Femmes, has its own <em>grand départ</em>. Television audiences in 170 countries can watch as the women’s peloton races across a 1,029km (639 miles) circuit over eight days. (The men’s race was 3,350km over 21 days.)

As with most professional sports, women’s cycling suffers from less money and exposure than the male version. The female winner of the yellow jersey will take home 10% of what her male counterpart makes. Still, the race marks a gear shift. Broadcasting deals have locked networks into showing the 2023 tour, and Zwift, a training app, will sponsor the Tour de France Femmes for at least four years. Female cyclists have slogged to reach this point; it should be downhill from here.

## Weekend profile: the climatologists transforming how we discuss weather

“People don’t have to die in their tens of thousands,” says Friederike Otto, with a touch of exasperation. In 2014 Dr Otto co-founded the World Weather Attribution (WWA) initiative, a collective of climate researchers and statisticians that has transformed the understanding of extreme weather events, such as the remarkable [trio of heatwaves](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/07/19/the-increase-in-simultaneous-heatwaves) that hit Europe, China and America this week. 

The idea was born of frustration with the academic distinction between climate and weather. “Climate” denotes macro, long-term trends; “weather” is what’s going on outside your window. Most people are more interested in daily weather patterns than decadal or even longer-term patterns. In the 2010s a group of researchers decided that to make the world understand why climate change mattered, they needed to introduce it into conversations about the weather, including the forecasts people see on television. 

Thus was the WWA conceived. The group works with the Red Cross Red Crescent’s Climate Centre, which gathers data on the number of people affected by any given climate event. If the number passes a certain threshold, Dr Otto and her collaborators, Sjoukje Philip and Sarah Kew of the Dutch meteorology institute, activate the WWA community. They canvass “everyone we know” to form an ad-hoc group of expert modellers. The exercise is, on the face of it, simple: to simulate two atmospheres, one with all the accumulated greenhouse-gas emissions of the last two centuries, and one that is unsullied. By comparing these two worlds, they can say whether a specific event is more or less likely to happen in a climate-changed atmosphere. 

This has led to headline-grabbing statements: that the [northern European floods last year](https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/08/23/climate-change-made-north-west-europes-lethal-flood-more-likely) were made up to nine times more likely by anthropogenic climate change, the [Siberian heatwave of 2020](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2020/07/15/siberias-heatwave-would-not-have-happened-without-climate-change) was many thousand times more likely, and the [Pacific Northwest heatwave](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2021/06/29/why-are-the-north-western-united-states-and-british-columbia-suffering-a-heatwave) of 2021 would have been virtually impossible without historical emissions. Such statements, and the underlying methodology, are now part of the climate vernacular. They are also applied elsewhere, such as in legal disputes where people or communities [seek compensation for climate-change-induced damages](https://www.economist.com/international/2022/04/23/lawsuits-aimed-at-greenhouse-gas-emissions-are-a-growing-trend). 

Extreme heat is one of the most straightforward impacts of global warming, and virtually every contemporary heatwave was made [worse or more likely by emissions](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/07/20/todays-heatwaves-are-a-warning-of-worse-to-come), or both. But Dr Otto worries that this engenders fatalism. “Yes it’s climate change…but we are also not powerless to do something about it,” she says. “That…is what’s missing in the conversation.”

## Russia tries to woo Africa

Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, embarks on Sunday on a visit to Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda and Congo-Brazzaville. The trip is in part a prelude to a Russia-Africa summit scheduled for next year. But Mr Lavrov has more immediate goals. Russia wants international support for its invasion of Ukraine, about which some African countries have [expressed ambivalence](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/03/12/why-russia-wins-some-sympathy-in-africa-and-the-middle-east). It also wants to convince the continent’s leaders that Western sanctions, not Russia’s war of choice, are to blame for rising [food](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2022/05/19/a-world-grain-shortage-puts-tens-of-millions-at-risk) and petrol prices. 

Ultimately Russia hopes to win African support in a wider ideological battle against the West. ([China seeks the same.](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2022-05-28)) To foster goodwill, the Kremlin plays up the Soviet Union’s historical support for African decolonisation movements. Writing in several African newspapers on Friday Mr Lavrov said that, unlike the West, Russia “had not stained itself” with colonial crimes, and pledged to “continue to pursue a peace-loving foreign policy.” Ukrainians may disagree.

## China’s quest for the heavens

<em>Tiangong</em>, China’s space station (the name means ​​“heavenly palace”), has been under construction since 2021, when its first module was launched. On Sunday, if all goes to plan, a second module named <em>Wentian</em> (“quest for the heavens”) will be blasted into orbit from a spaceport at Wenchang, off China’s southern coast. A third module is due to launch later this year.

Even when finished (probably next year) the 100-tonne <em>Tiangong</em> station will be a tiddler compared to the 440-tonne International Space Station. But China is not welcome aboard the ISS: a law in America, one of the ISS’s main funders, prohibits official contact with China’s space programme over national-security concerns.

China’s space programme is nevertheless marching forward. It is only the third country, after America and the Soviet Union, to have mastered crewed spaceflight. Whether <em>Tiangong</em> will have any value beyond national pride is another question. Many scientists consider the ISS, with an estimated price tag of over $100bn, the most expensive white elephant ever built.
