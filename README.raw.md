## <p align="center">Catch up quickly on the global stories that matter</p>

India’s prime minister, <strong>Narendra Modi</strong>, publicly criticised Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, telling President <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> that “today’s era is not an era of war”. Speaking at the [Shanghai Co-operation Organisation](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2022/09/14/what-is-the-shanghai-co-operation-organisation) summit in Uzbekistan, Mr Putin responded that he understood Mr Modi’s concerns. Later the Russian leader said his goals in Ukraine had not changed—the main one being the “liberation” of the Donbas region. He then appeared to threaten to hit more civilian infrastructure.

The<strong> S&amp;P 500</strong> suffered its worst week since June, shedding 4.8%, dragged down by FedEx, whose shares dropped by a fifth. A day earlier the delivery firm announced cost cuts and poor preliminary results, citing weak global demand. With inflation [stubbornly high](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/09/13/america-still-has-an-inflation-problem), investors are bracing for the Federal Reserve to [raise interest rates](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/14/to-fix-americas-inflation-problem-the-federal-reserve-must-go-big) by three-quarters of a percentage point next week.

Some 20m Shia Muslim pilgrims gathered in the holy city of Karbala, in Iraq, for the annual <strong>Arbaeen</strong> festival. It is one of the largest mass gatherings of people anywhere on Earth. The event is the culmination of 40 days of mourning in memory of Imam Hussein, a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, who was killed in the city in the year 680.

<strong>Ayatollah Ali Khamene</strong><strong>i</strong>, Iran’s supreme leader, offered a response of sorts to rumours that he is gravely ill by appearing in public for the first time in two weeks. The 83-year-old cleric spoke at an Arbaeen ceremony in Iran. A report yesterday in the <em>New York Times</em> suggested that he had been in a critical condition and had undergone bowel surgery.

Despite reports of sporadic shelling by both sides, a ceasefire deal between <strong>Kyrgyzstan</strong> and <strong>Tajikistan</strong> held a day after intense fighting along the border. The latest flare-up between the central Asian neighbours began on Wednesday, although skirmishes have been common for years. Hundreds of thousands of people have been evacuated from the area. Russia offered to act as peacemaker.

The governor of <strong>West Virginia</strong> signed into law a near-total abortion ban. The measure, with exceptions for some victims of rape and incest, prohibits the procedure after an embryo is implanted in the uterus, usually within days of conception. West Virginia is the second state, after Indiana, to pass restrictive abortion legislation since the Supreme Court [overturned <em>Roe v Wade</em>](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/06/25/americas-abortion-providers-face-a-fight-for-survival); in several other states pre-<em>Roe</em> bans have come into force.

Thousands of people on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu have been urged to leave their homes, before the expected arrival of <strong>Typhoon Nanmadol</strong> on Sunday. Bringing with it up to 500mm of rainfall and winds of 270kph, the storm is expected to turn north-east towards Tokyo after making landfall. It could be one of the most damaging to hit Japan in recent years.

<strong>Word of the week:</strong> <em>boyan, </em>a word meaning “liquorice” in the Karakalpak language, spoken in Karakalpakstan, western Uzbekistan. [Read the full story](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/09/15/liquorice-flourishes-in-salty-soils-of-the-dried-up-aral-sea).

## Ukraine’s stunning counter-offensive

On Friday Ukrainian officials said they had discovered a mass grave containing more than 400 bodies in Izyum, a recently liberated town in the north-eastern province of [Kharkiv.](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/09/15/vladimir-putins-war-is-failing-the-west-should-help-it-fail-faster) As Ukrainian forces recapture Russian-occupied territory, they may make more such gruesome discoveries. The [lightning operation](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/09/ukraine-seizes-the-initiative-in-the-east) in Kharkiv province, launched on September 5th, has overwhelmed Russian forces. The speed of the advance is the result of a superbly executed plan and new Western weaponry that has denied Russia air supremacy. But Russia’s army has also proved brittle. Its command system appears to be in crisis.

The [Kharkiv offensive](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/15/a-stunning-counter-offensive-by-ukraines-armed-forces) is the most important development in the war since Russia abandoned northern Ukraine in late March. It opens up the prospect that Ukraine could recapture part of the Luhansk region, thus denying Russia’s stated objective of occupying the entire Donbas in the east. More importantly, it shows that Ukraine is capable of fast, complex and daring attacks; that Russia can be dislodged; and that Ukraine can therefore win.

## An unexpectedly close Senate race in Ohio

The campaign in the Midwest is heating up. On Saturday Donald Trump hosts a rally in Youngstown, Ohio, where he will endorse J.D. Vance, the [author-turned-MAGA-intellectual](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/09/15/how-the-left-and-jd-vance-learnt-to-despise-each-other) Republican candidate for the Senate in the upcoming [midterms](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/09/07/the-democrats-are-likely-to-lose-the-house-but-keep-the-senate). Thanks largely to the former president’s support, Mr Vance won his primary in May easily. But he has struggled since. Recent polls give Tim Ryan, the Democratic candidate, a slight edge. 

That may be surprising in a state Mr Trump won comfortably in 2020, but Mr Vance’s incendiary side is hurting him. His call, for example, for a total ban on abortions, with no exceptions for rape, has provided plenty of fodder for Mr Ryan. Earlier this year Ohio suffered a storm of negative publicity after a ten-year-old rape victim was forced to travel to Indiana for an abortion. Mr Vance has also struggled with fundraising. A big rally with Mr Trump might help, but that may not be enough to win back voters.

## Poland opens a propaganda-heavy canal

Where cool Baltic waves once lapped a remote sandbank, Poland’s government has created a [megaproject meant to outwit Russia](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/09/15/poland-opens-a-propaganda-heavy-canal). With pomp and pageantry, on Saturday a 1.3km artificial waterway linking the Vistula Lagoon in the north-east to the Baltic Sea will be unveiled. It will allow ships to bypass a Russian-controlled strait, which has occasionally been shut off.

The canal cost more than 2bn zlotys ($420m), but the government has shrugged off any economic (and environmental) misgivings by casting it as a matter of national security. Military vessels, however, are unlikely to navigate a shallow lagoon so close to Kaliningrad, a heavily armed Russian exclave on its eastern edge. And there is little civilian traffic using the waterway’s ports, making it something of a white elephant. But the government, hawkish on the Kremlin, has dug its heels in. “We will break Russia’s domination in the region,” boasted Marek Grobarczyk, the official overseeing the project.

## A big boxing bout: Canelo vs Golovkin III

Boxing is defined by epic rivalries. The three fights between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier lit up the sport in the 1970s. Today the ticket-selling feud is between Saul “Canelo” Álvarez of Mexico and Gennady Golovkin of Kazakhstan. Both have dominated several weight categories and have been considered the best “pound-for-pound” boxer in the world. On Saturday evening in Las Vegas, they will go at it for a third time. 

The pair’s first meeting five years ago was a blockbuster bout that ended in a disputed draw. A year later, in another close contest, judges gave the win to Mr Álvarez. Mr Golovkin feels he has unfinished business, but he is 40 and has hardly fought in recent years. Mr Álvarez is eight years younger and the favourite. If the encounter matches the previous gruelling acts then boxing, which has recently [lost fans](https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/04/22/scandal-overshadows-boxings-world-heavyweight-title-bout) to other combat sports, may be the biggest winner.

## Weekend profile: Giorgia Meloni, Italy’s probable new prime minister

Giorgia Meloni grew up as the daughter of a single parent. Her father left soon after she was born in 1977. Ms Meloni and her sister subsequently compounded their mother’s problems by accidentally setting fire to their apartment in a leafy Rome suburb. Recounting this incident in her autobiography, Ms Meloni is amused rather than ashamed. The loss of her childhood home might have left her with “the courage to set up a political home years later”, she jokes.

That home is the [Brothers of Italy (FdI) party](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/08/11/can-anything-stop-italys-radical-right), which polls suggest will win the most votes in the general election on September 25th. If the conservative alliance of which it is a part wins a comfortable parliamentary majority, as is expected, Ms Meloni could well be Italy’s next prime minister. 

Back in her girlhood, after the fire, Ms Meloni’s family moved to cheaper accommodation in Garbatella, a working-class district in the south of Rome. There she grew up poor but happy, though “a bit irascible”, she writes. At age 15—in reaction to the assassination of Paolo Borsellino, a right-wing anti-Mafia judge—Ms Meloni joined the youth wing of the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement (MSI). She did not go to university, yet by age 29 was a national lawmaker, representing MSI’s successor movement, the National Alliance. When she was 31 Silvio Berlusconi, then prime minister, made her the youngest minister in the history of the republic.

Ms Meloni’s career has not been hindered by the fact that in 2016 she had a child out of wedlock, despite her party’s vigorous advocacy for traditional values. In recent years, she has worked hard to soften her image, toning down her rhetoric. But her periodic lapses into strident euroscepticism—most recently during a campaign rally in Milan on September 11th —suggest that little has really changed. Someone who knows her calls her views “Trumpite”. Ms Meloni and FdI’s rapid journey from the fringes of Italian politics to centre stage has taken many observers by surprise. But she still has to make her position clear—and prove she can govern a country.
