Annual <strong>inflation</strong> in<strong> America</strong> eased slightly in July, dipping from 9.1% in June to 8.5%. The number raises hopes that American inflation has peaked, as the prices of gas and other commodities have fallen in recent weeks. But the rate is still close to America’s highest in four decades, and prices for housing and food are still rising.

<strong>Russian </strong>shelling killed at least 13 people in the <strong>Dnipropetrovsk </strong>region of central Ukraine, according to Ukrainian authorities. Separately, Energoatom, a Ukrainian state nuclear-power operator, warned that Russia intends to sever the connection between the <strong>Zaporizhzhia</strong> [nuclear plant](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/03/04/europes-largest-nuclear-plant-shuts-down-after-a-russian-attack) and Ukraine’s power grid, and connect it to Russia’s instead. That requires a technically difficult process with potentially disastrous consequences, warned Energoatom’s boss.

Leading Republicans denounced the [FBI raid](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/09/an-fbi-raid-on-donald-trumps-home-ignites-a-political-firestorm) on <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> Florida home. Kevin McCarthy, the most senior Republican in the House of Representatives, vowed to investigate the justice department should his party take control of the chamber after mid-term elections. Republicans used anger at the operation to fuel a funding drive. Meanwhile, Mr Trump was dealt another blow when a federal judge ruled that the House could request his tax returns.

Early results from <strong>Kenya’s </strong>[presidential election](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/08/07/why-kenyas-election-matters) suggested a [tight race](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/08/07/kenyas-presidential-election-looks-too-close-to-call) between the two leading candidates, deputy president William Ruto and opposition leader Raila Odinga. Turnout was low, and the election commission now has up to a week to declare the winner. Recent elections have been scarred by violence after the result was announced.

Kishida Fumio, <strong>Japan’s</strong> prime minister reshuffled his cabinet, removing several ministers with links to the controversial <strong>Unification Church</strong>. The [man who in July assassinated Abe Shinzo](https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/07/19/what-drove-yamagami-tetsuya-to-kill-abe-shinzo), a former prime minister, said he was motivated by a grudge against the religious movement, which he claims bankrupted his mother. Mr Abe regularly courted the church. Since his killing the sect’s political ties have come under increased scrutiny. 

<strong>Elon Musk</strong> sold almost $7bn-worth of shares in <strong>Tesla</strong>, his electric-car company, saying he wants to avoid an emergency sale of the firm’s stock if he has to buy <strong>Twitter</strong>. Earlier this year Mr Musk agreed to buy the social-media platform for $44bn, before [almost immediately trying to pull out](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/05/19/elon-musk-twitter-and-an-epic-case-of-buyers-remorse) of the deal. A court in October will decide whether he has to pay up.

<strong>Coinbase</strong>, the largest cryptocurrency exchange based in America, posted a $1.1bn loss for the second quarter. At the same point last year, during the sector’s boom times, Coinbase reported a net profit of $1.6bn. The firm’s slide offers yet more evidence of crypto’s [recent implosion](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/06/23/three-mechanisms-for-crypto-contagion). Its share price tanked.

<strong>Fact of the day:</strong> $10bn, the amount of venture capital funding for American aerospace and defence startups in 2021, triple 2019’s figure. [Read the full article](https://www.economist.com/business/2022/08/08/can-tech-reshape-the-pentagon).

## Inflation down but not out in America

After months of soaring inflation, America may get a partial reprieve. In data for July, released on Wednesday, consumer prices rose by 8.5% year-on-year, down from a four-decade high of 9.1% in June. That is likely to prompt discussion of whether America has finally passed peak inflation.

The details of the data are more sobering. A fall in oil prices—down more than 10% in July from June—accounted for much of the headline decline in inflation. Take out volatile food and energy costs, and inflation remained too hot for comfort. Moreover, nominal wages are also still rising strongly, generating yet more upward pressure on prices. Markets had hoped the Federal Reserve might be able to slow the pace of its interest-rate increases. But with inflation like this, it may not want to let up.

## Republicans rally around Trump

The raid may have been shocking; the response was not. On Monday, the FBI searched Donald Trump’s Florida estate, reportedly part of an inquiry into whether the former president had mishandled classified material after leaving office. The raid [could suggest](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/09/an-fbi-raid-on-donald-trumps-home-ignites-a-political-firestorm) that evidence of a federal crime lurked in Mr Trump’s estate. Merrick Garland, the attorney-general, is not one for taking bold steps based on whims.

  
 This is only one of many legal threats Mr Trump faces. On Wednesday he will be questioned under oath as part of an investigation in New York into his businesses accounts. Yet it may help unite Republicans around him. After the raid Republican congressmen vowed to investigate the investigators, should the party win a majority in the House of Representatives at the mid-terms in November. Mr Trump called the raid a “weaponisation” of the justice system, intended to to derail another potential presidential bid. His enduring political influence is already visible in [Republican primaries](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/08/03/donald-trumps-preferred-candidates-sweep-to-victory-in-arizona) across the country. According to Politico, a news website, insiders think the raid will, if anything, accelerate Mr Trump’s decision to run again in 2024. And he is already using outrage about the raid to solicit donations for his “Save America” campaign.

## Europe bans Russian coal

The European Union’s ban on imports of Russian coal, agreed in April as part of its fifth package of sanctions, takes effect at midnight on Wednesday. One of the world’s biggest exporters of the black stuff, Russia supplied around 70% of the EU’s imports of thermal coal (used to generate electricity) and 45% of all coal imports last year, according to Bruegel, a think-tank in Brussels.

  
 Yet coal matters less to the Kremlin than gas or oil. Of the €94.3bn ($96.5bn) that the EU spent on Russian fuel last year, just €5.3bn ($5.4bn) went on coal. Ukraine’s government would like the EU to go much faster restricting other fuel sources. But a planned embargo on oil will come fully into force only next year. And the EU has so far imposed no restrictions on Russian natural gas at all, other than asking its members to [use less of it](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/28/the-eu-agrees-on-an-energy-diet-to-fight-russian-gas-cuts). Instead, Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, is [cutting gas exports](https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/07/11/europe-is-preparing-for-russian-gas-to-be-cut-off-this-winter) to try to blackmail Europe into relaxing sanctions.

## A cruel summer for TUI?

<strong>A cruel summer for TUI?</strong>

While much of Europe basks on summer holiday, TUI—the travel giant that will have organised many of those trips—reported its third quarter earnings. A costly hit from flight disruptions this summer left it with an operating loss of €27m ($27m), following two years of travel disruptions caused by covid-19. The outlook looks somewhat brighter though, with future bookings close to pre-pandemic levels.  
  
 The German firm, which owns 1,600 travel agencies and five airlines, suffered from the ravages inflicted on the travel sector by the pandemic. It has struggled with irate customers upset by this summer’s [travel chaos](https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/07/05/why-british-holiday-makers-should-brace-for-more-misery-this-summer), as thousands of flights were delayed or cancelled. And looming recessions in Germany and Britain could hit the group hard. Further turbulence might come from the departure of Fritz Joussen, the group’s chief executive, who announced his resignation in June after a successful ten-year stint. His successor will take over a ship that is yet to be steadied.

## The Chess Olympiad concludes

In Mahabalipuram, a sleepy Indian town some 40km from Chennai, over 2,000 players from 187 countries have been battling in the Chess Olympiad, the game’s top international team event. As the teams depart on Wednesday, Uzbek and Ukrainian players will be particularly happy: they won the men’s and women’s categories respectively.

As rooks and knights jousted on the [chessboard](https://www.economist.com/1843/2015/06/15/chess), there was action away from it, too. On August 7th Arkady Dvorkovich, a former Russian deputy prime minister, was re-elected as the president of the International Chess Federation, which organises the Olympiad, winning a landslide victory over Andrii Baryshpolets, a Ukrainian grandmaster. Mr Dvorkovich’s re-election is controversial. Though he initially decried Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—an action described as a “​​national betrayal” by a Russian MP—he later released a statement praising his country’s soldiers. Russia now calls him “our candidate”. 

For all that, despite Mr Dvorkovich’s position, his countrymen are still banned from the federation’s competitions. Soft power only goes so far.
